suzuki,aerio,2002,blubaustin, 07/21/2013,Suzuki Aerio 2002 GS,3,"Pretty cheap car to buy bought one for $1400 with
95k miles, currently has 98k miles. Pretty good starter car if you can invest the money in it to keep it running. For example: a person who cant consistently pay a car payment ontop of full coverage insurance but can afford to save up money and eventually fix stuff. Car is pretty peppy so I don't know what other people are talking about on the car not having pep. Also seems to get pretty good gas mileage. Hwy it averages about 35mpg city, I haven't really measured."
suzuki,aerio,2002,kimmypoo, 03/31/2009,This Car Should Definately Be Revived!,4,"I bought my car used from a dealership.  Hadn't ever seen any model like it.  I was actually one of the first in my entire community w/ this type of car, stopping traffic w/ people asking me what type of car it was how cute it was.  So, that tells you something about it's looks.  Driving experience has been wonderful.  No problems whatsoever.  I use mine everyday over 123k now and still great.  Roomy (even for 6,4 husband), reliable, works great!  I'd want to buy another one if needed but found it's been discontinued.  W/ this car's reliability record, this should not be!  Bring it back Suzuki!  "
suzuki,aerio,2002,tucsonics, 08/09/2012,Sub-Toyota Quality,2," The quality sucks. I had to have the water pump replaced, engine mounts replaced, right axel replaced, and only have 99k miles. The front spoiler is too low, and got hooked on many curbs. It's trashed and costs $800 to replace. Not worth it. Poor paint job, scratches off easy to reveal black primer on bumpers. "
suzuki,aerio,2002,456, 03/19/2002,AERIO SX,5,"GREAT VEHICLE, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, HANDLES WELL, LOTS OF ROOM FOR HAULING, PLUS IT TURNS A LOT OF HEADS GOING DOWN THE STREET. THIS IS MY SECOND SUZUKI THE OTHER ONE ONLY NEEDED OIL CHANGES AND TIRE ROTATIONS."
suzuki,aerio,2002,dee, 07/07/2017,Bad motor,1,"This is our second one. I bought it as a back up. We loved this car in the beginning. we bought it used. it was well taken care of, sense my teenager was driven it and she loved it and she wrecked the first. I tried to make sure i kept this one in good shape. I made sure it was in for servicing checks every 6 weeks. She wanted it to last but it didn't--not even with great care.    All of a sudden the timing went on it.  plus $600 more for other parts--Because my daughter loved it so much..i had to pay to have it fixed. -It was expensive. Then 48 hours after my daughter gets it back it gets low oil pressure light,  it had to be towed -another big expense on it.  Four different places- say the engine is done,  they think the engine seized. I was told by 3 out of the 4 places that no engine is available within 900 miles and the engine that is 900 miles away has a blown head gasket.  I'm upset---The inside of my daughters car is like brand new, the cars body is also like brand new, paint is in perfect condition.  I invested on a brand new paint job the month before. The car now sits in our garage and my credit card is full of the expense.
"
suzuki,aerio,2002,ccox, 07/16/2008,Love this car,4,"Bought this car because I really like the way it drove. Very comfortable, quick response, roomy. At the time I really wanted a Chevy Monte Carlo, but when I test drove it, I decided on the Aerio. Much more room! I have had this car for 4 years and have no complaints, no problems! It's a great car."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Mike, 12/27/2007,175000 and still runs great,3,"I use this car for work. Stop and go driving. I start and stop the engine approx 41 times a day and the car runs for 10-12 hrs at a time.  I have beat this car into construction sites, drilled a guard rail doing 65 mph backwards, and drove it off road nailing rocks and going over logs. I replaced tires, two front wheel bearings at 150,000 miles, 4 front brake rotors, a serpentine belt.  It now needs a full exhaust system and a radiator, its not the most comfortable car on the market or the most fuel effecient but keep good fluids in it and it should provide you with adaquate transportation.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy one again.  "
suzuki,aerio,2002,Bill D., 05/24/2002,I love this car!,5,"I saw the Aerio for the first time at 
the NY Auto Show and was impressed. I 
bought one and love it. It has good 
power, handling, general performance. 
The winshield, and side glass provide a 
lot of visibility, but that means a lot 
of eye strain from light as well as the 
heat from the sun. Also, the LCD 
display on the radio is hard to see in 
direct sun. I've gotten many positive 
comments about the car and my teenage 
son likes it too. I'd recommend the car 
to anyone looking for a sporty, 
affordable, small wagon."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Curtis, 04/30/2010,Great Car!,4,"I got this car 2 years ago with 45,000 miles on it. I have been in 2 accidents with it and it still runs great. It has 94,000 and I've never had a problem with it besides now-a-days it doesn't want to shift right away when I get above 50 mph and my radio has a short. Other than that it is a good starter car. I am looking to get rid of it thought because I want a SUV. "
suzuki,aerio,2002,steven Netti, 09/19/2002,SX,3,"Not Bad

The dealer was bad==not the car

I would buy again elsewhere"
suzuki,aerio,2002,sricaud, 01/02/2003,2002 Suzuki Aerio,5,"Pleasantly surprised with the 
acceleration and comfort of this 
vehicle. Priced several models in this 
category and got the best value and 
features for the money."
suzuki,aerio,2002,evb, 02/19/2003,Still Happy after all these months,4,"Been driving my Aerio for 6 months now 
and I'm still smitten. Can't understand 
why there are so few on the road. 
Handles great, even in the snow with 
front wheel drive. Great head room and 
I love the height; all the convienence 
of my old Toyota hatchback without 
having to stoop to get in."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Ellesmere, 03/29/2002,Practical Fun,4,"Purchaced the Aerio one week ago.  Very sporty car with lots of internal storage and space.  Handling is a little wobbly, probably due to the height and light steering.  Transmission shifts very well and the cockpit is remarkably quiet.  Have found some vibrations when going over bumps, that I will need to get fixed."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Janice Henry, 08/12/2016,I luv this car!!!,5, 
suzuki,aerio,2002,quickg, 04/19/2002,A good car that could be better,4,"Engine is powerful, but loses luster 
with AC on. Automatic transmission 
shifts well. Brakes are generally good, 
but tend to lock up on wet roads 
without ABS. Stereo is good. Standard 
tires on the S are low grade. Handling 
is stable, steering feel is about 
right. Interior is spacious in front 
and back, seats are very comfortable, 
seating position is tall and provides 
great forward visibility. However, rear 
visibility is poor because of a very 
high rear end. Trunk is huge. Side 
mirrors are large and folding. The S 
has power windows, but not power locks. 
The car is distinctive looking, but 
side and rear extensions make tires 
look small and the car look overweight 
and ungainly."
suzuki,aerio,2002,djcs, 03/31/2006,Upgrades,1,The Suzuki Aerio seems to have no power and no leg room. The engine size needs to be a 2.8 liter or larger. This will give much better gas mileage and power to pick up speed due to the wieght of the vehicle. The steering wheel needs to be raised more up words. The dash board could have more features. GPS maybe. This is a family station wagon. The family needs to be safe and know where they are going.
suzuki,aerio,2002,Qeenasheba, 01/03/2006,Aerio SX YAY!,5,"The 2002 Suzuki Aerio SX was the best car I have ever had. I would give it an 11 on a scale from 1 to 10. It's sporty and fun to look at as well as to drive. It has tons of storage, and kept me safe in an accident. I love this car!"
suzuki,aerio,2002,micndom, 04/01/2002,AERIO - Excellent value for the money,4,Good acceleration and breaking (ABS). Power steering is effortless without being too sensitive. Relatively high sitting position. Plenty of interior space. A lot of fun to drive !
suzuki,aerio,2002,ntotrr, 05/01/2002,Big Value in Small Package,4,"An excellent value for the money, with 
a level of refinement found in higher-
priced cars.  Ergonomics and controls 
are very good.  Interior space is 
exemplary, the materials used are of 
god quality. 

Performance is good, the 5-speed 
shifts almost effortlessly but the 
clutch is a bit too soft.

Overall, highly recommended and fun-to-
drive."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Gerrix, 05/13/2002,a SUV view in a compact car,4,"It's been a week that I test drive this 
Sedan and so far it's a joy. The riding 
is smooth and quiet at legal speeds.
The engine is a bit noisier when pushed 
but fortunately it doesn't need to be 
often.
The high seating position is probably 
the most specific feature of this car. 
Only the Matrix/Vibe can compare in 
this segment. With this feature, you 
have a great view of the road and it's 
very easy to get in and out of the car.
The digital dash is a surprise, but I 
learned to love it for its accuracy and 
its visibility."
suzuki,aerio,2002,micky, 05/21/2002,wonderful,4,"What a great car. I haven't found
anything I don't like about it. Quiet
and quick and I love the digital dash!"
suzuki,aerio,2002,John-O, 06/23/2002,So far so good!,4,"Just purchased this vehicle from 
Cottonwood Suzuki in AZ.  Was a little 
skeptical at purchasing a first year 
vehicle but the difference in price 
between the Suzuki and the Toyota 
Matrix was the deciding factor.  I 
paid $14,464 for the Aerio SX, with 
the same features the Toyota would of 
been $17,800.  Also, the Suzuki has a 
larger engine, approximately 10HP.  So 
far it has exceeded expectations.  It 
handles nicely, engine is very quiet 
while idling although when you punch 
it you know it's there!  I just hope 
it will last as long as a Toyota 
engine.  I guess I'll find out."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Florida_AerioSX, 07/05/2002,My Yellow Submarine....,4,"I've only had my car two months- but 
it's been a great ""ride"" so far.  I'm 
finally getting used to the stares that 
my ""yellow sub"" gets.  I love all of 
the standard equipment and the power 
that the engine has.  I wish it got 
better mileage (appx 25 mpg mostly 
highway), but I guess if you want ""pep"" 
something has to give.  It feels very 
stable on the road and seems well 
built.  I can't wait to several years 
of fun with this car."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Bratt, 07/11/2002,Great Car!!,5,"   I'm Not only an owner of two 
Suzuki's  I'm also a Suzuki Salesman. I 
have done many hours of research on all 
the vehicles from toyota, to honda to 
the lesser knowns. The Suzuki stacks up 
well every time. 
    Aside from that, I see many of them 
come in on trade always with the same 
story ""I never had to do anything to it""
Oil changes, tires and brakes, thats 
it!! I have personally seen more than 
my share of suzuki's with more than 
200,000 miles, 4 of them over 300,000 
all telling of the low maintnenence. "
suzuki,aerio,2002,Clifford, 07/11/2002,What a Car,4,"I just bought this about 2 months ago.  
The car is really fun to drive, is 
peppy, with PLENTY of room inside the 
vehicle and the trunk is huge and holds 
lots of items.  The car is fully 
equiped however I paid extra for an arm 
rest between the front seats. I test 
drove the comparable Toyota, Ford and 
Honda.  No comparison for the money, 
Suzuki is way out in front.  If this 
car is advertized properly by the 
manufacturer, it will become a real 
rival to its competitors."
suzuki,aerio,2002,johnny sexton, 07/25/2002,"Roomy, stylish, and built well",4,"As the owner of a 1996 Suzuki Swift 
with 144,000 miles on it, (and not a 
day in the shop) I know how well built 
Suzuki cars are. But I didn't think 
they could ever come up with a 
sporty,stylish car. But they have. I 
love my new Aerio, it gives a great 
ride,and has excelent acceleration. The 
seats are a little spartanesque, but 
extremely supportive. I am sure in 
144,000 miles, I will love it as much 
as my Swift. Suzuki has finally gone 
mainstream. By the way, I'm keeping my 
Swift also."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Mr. Bill S. , 08/26/2002,A home run for Suzuki,4,"I am a proud owner of an Electric 
Yellow SX. Simply, a great car. One of 
the best I have ever owned (beleive me, 
I have had a few, to say the least). 
The car is Roomy, comfortable, has a 
great driving position and a taught 
well controlled ride."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Christo, 08/28/2002,best car for the buck,5,"The Aerio GS is a great car , fun  to 
drive . With the new 7/100000 power 
train warranty should you ever worry , 
the body is stylish and the exterior is 
unique .The only problem is the car is 
NEW !NO AFTER MARKET parts.I went to 
have the oil changed to find out the 
local oil change garage didn't have the 
car in the system .I am also looking to 
change the fog bulbs to yellow , but 
can't find a aftermarket part #, only 
the gunuine suzuki part #. But DAMN the 
car is fun to drive.My car is 1 month 
old but i will get back to this in 6 
months for a follow up."
suzuki,aerio,2002,suiteseptember, 09/04/2002,Aerio!,5,"The new Suzuki Aerio is fun to drive! I
have only had mine for 2 months, but I
love  it!"
suzuki,aerio,2002,Bett1e, 09/13/2002,Buy the Toyota Echo instead,2,"I have become a career test driver.  In 
the past two (2) weeks, I have test 
drove at least 5 or 6 cars.  The Aerio 
is by far the least impressive of the 
whole bunch.<p>
The handling was pretty good, but the 
car is just ugly and, if ugly is what 
you seek, I would recommend the Toyota 
Echo.<p>

The salesperson acted like he knew I 
wouldn't like the car and that's why he 
didn't try to sell me on the car.  It's 
sad when your own salespeople don't 
believe in the product."
suzuki,aerio,2002,gomaingo, 09/17/2002,"Great Value, Runs Strong",5,"The Aerio has the feel of a large car, 
with it's high roof and large trunk. 
You sit higher than most drivers which 
gives you great visability. The real 
fun comes while driving this quick 
little car, that handles suprisingly 
well. My only surprize is that I do not 
see more of them on the road."
suzuki,aerio,2002,hid aerio, 09/25/2002,nice car.,4,"i think its a very attractive car since 
lots of stranger actually asked me 
about the car.  its a good car.. a real 
bargain too."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Aerio_Owner, 09/30/2002,Love It!,4,"I've had my Aerio for 4000 miles now, 
and driven in many different 
situations - road trips, city driving, 
5 passengers - it conquers all with 
aplomb! My backseat passengers over 6 
feet love the legroom of the adjustable 
back-seats. I love the versatility - I 
carried a 32"" TV IN THE BOX in my 
Aerio - no problem. The stereo sounds 
great and is easy to use. It starts 
quickly and runs well. My only gripe is 
that the HVAC is a little wierd and 
takes some getting used to."
suzuki,aerio,2002,crazy canuk, 10/17/2002,smokin',4," i ninitially was looking at the grand vitara-but once i stepped into the aerio
i was prey to the mesh seats and doors-i know style/quality when i see it.
i didn't even test drive it-i let my intuition do the deciding.
i luv the seats the best- there thick, supportive and make driving enjoyable!
as with any 4 cylinder though-acceleration is loud until you reach
cruising.
its preety quiet on the highway-much quieter than my dads $50,000 suv."
suzuki,aerio,2002,ROOKIE, 03/27/2002,Never look innovation in the mouth,4,"Having read other Aerio comments,I could not resist. One should never equate innovation with the commanality of competitors.  I specifically mean unfavorable wording re:digital readout for speedo, tach and other essentials.

The vehicle is uniquely different;   like Heidi Klum.

Hasta la proxima- Don't lift."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Its not your sub, 08/11/2002,It's not your yellow sub it's mine,4,"I bought my first Suz. on looks and the 
nice storage bins in back.  It also 
came with a nice diaper pale ""wash 
bucket"" as some say.  The back is also 
the right height for a changing table.  
I am the only yellow Aerio SX in 4 
counties.  I have so many people just 
stop and go what is that.  My mileage 
is about 25-30 depending on air.  Solid 
car Solid dealer.  I also had the 
dealer spice up the interior with the 
optional brushed aluminum over the 
glove box, around the stereo, and 
around the instruments."
suzuki,aerio,2002,ra2dale, 10/04/2002,Nice car,4,"I've been driving my Suzuki for four 
months and I'm pretty happy with it. It 
has good power and gives me great gas 
mileage - a much as 30mpg on some 
freeway drives.  For the price and 
compared to other cars in its class 
It's a good buy."
suzuki,aerio,2002,suiteseptember, 07/01/2002,This is the best car for the price!!,5,"From the first time I saw the 
commercial for the 2002 Suzuki Aeroi, 
I knew that I had to have one!  I have 
only had mine 4 days but I love it!"
suzuki,aerio,2002,hawaiiankine, 08/23/2002,Sweet car for the price...,4,"If I remeber right, the sticker price 
on my Aerio was around $15,500.  Well, 
I ended up walking away paying only 
$13,000.  For the price I paid, I don't 
think I could've gotten a better car.  
Almost every other car in its class is 
under-powered, suffers flimsy 
construction, and has poor styling.  
Not the Aerio.  Thank god its made AND 
assembled in Japan...only place I trust 
to assemble a car.  The engine revs 
pretty nicely, redlines around 6700 
rpm."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Daniel Benfield, 12/27/2002,Great Car,5,"This is the best car purchase i have 
ever made. Alot better then my 2001 
Mercury cougar That was a piece of 
junk, nothing but problems with that 
car. But as for the Aerio, A must buy 
for any one! 10 Thumbs up!!!!!  
The Aerio is alot of fun to drive and 
quick for a 4banger. It gets alot of 
looks and thumbs up. Every one likes 
it that sees it."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Dave W., 06/12/2003,Our Four Wheel Motorcycle,4,"Our little suzy is quite a nice ride! I 
fell in love with the black onyx paint, 
it is beautiful! This car is the most 
defect free car I have ever owned, my 
only real problem is with the radio 
which Suzuki did'nt build. Great 
handling, good power, easy entry/exit, 
practical, fun, sporty, good looking 
etc. Some trim noise on coarse roads, 
I'm running these down myself and 
fixing them. I love the digital dash, 
its simple and the speedo can be read 
at a glance. The car isn't perfect but 
it sure is close... we love it!"
suzuki,aerio,2002,Jesse2040, 08/03/2003,"Great Car, Great Price",5,"Great Car with 140HP+, VERY reliable. 
my friends with their focis(focuses) 
and cavaliers laugh at my choice to go 
over-seas. I laughed at both of them 
last week when their crappy american 
made cars were in the shop for sensor 
failures and oil leaks. Gas miliage is 
great. It has a lot of pep to it."
suzuki,aerio,2002,tomgunn711, 08/14/2003,Excellent for city drivers,4,"I did extensive research and test 
drives of the competition (Matrix, 
Protege5 and Focus) before settling on 
the Aerio SX AWD ABS.   Basically, 
with the best crash rating from the 
IIHS and incredible value for an AWD 
car, I couldn't resist.  The seating 
position and terrific views are 
perfect for the city.  Also, the 
handling is good although highway 
stability was prob. best in the 
Protege5.  

There is more seating room than the 
others and the reliability has been 
Lexus like.  I have had no issues 
whatsoever in 6 months.    "
suzuki,aerio,2002,KC in WA, 08/21/2003,Budget but Beautiful,5,"I just bought a used ex-rental(with a

automatic for my wife. OK it's a budget 
car, (power windows, but no power 
locks, why?) but in silver she be 
lookin' fine (both the wife and the 
car!) Due to the price I paid, $8900

the price I wanted!   "
suzuki,aerio,2002,puce, 09/15/2003,2002 Suzuki Aerio SX wagon,4,"Have had no problems.  comfortable and 
enjoyable to drive.  Not out to race

suzuki,aerio,2002,robarr, 10/10/2003,Nice Little Car,4,"I love my Aerio. Although it has had a 
few problems that the dealership could 
not fix. So now I'm stuck with a car 
that hummmms when I step on the gas and 
when I come to an idle a rattling sound 
comes from the front of the car. Very 
disappointed with the dealerships 
mechanics and i now have to take the 
car which is still under warranty to my 
mechanic and pay out of my pocket. 
Thanks for nothing Suzuki Techs!"
suzuki,aerio,2002,one_aerio, 11/30/2003,Drove alot in one year,4,"The car so far has been great. It is
comfortable for long commute and easy to
maneuver.  An added bonus is plenty of
space.  Presently at 34000 miles there
has been a steady increase of build
noise.  Panel fasteners have begun to
make themselves known.  Furthermore, if
the rear windows are open while the
front windows are up the buffeting of
the wind will shake the rear doors. 
Good car for the price. "
suzuki,aerio,2002,rr, 01/02/2004,solid Jap sub-compact,4,"i like this most popular sub-compact 
(in Japan 2002-03) Japanese car though 
it isn't a real sporty car. The design 
and the material quality stand well 
after a year and a half. I drove it to 
Vegas twice. The car is also my daily 
working transportation. So far except 
routing oil changes, i have no other 
expenses yet. However, the rim and 
tires can be enlarged one standard 
higher. The aired suspension can be 
improved if the sporty feature isn't 
upgraded in the future...Suzuki should 
changes its marketing strategy, and 
more aggressively competes with other 
top brand names. "
suzuki,aerio,2002,TA62, 05/21/2005,The only import I can fit in,5,"This car is great on gas, very quick, and the room inside is awesome and comfortable. It looks good and it has more power and room than those honda sardine cans(civic)."
suzuki,aerio,2002,john, 05/22/2005,my aerio,5,Best quality auto have owned and ease of handling is superb definitely will look at Suzuki when buying in the far future the build is above everything else and is built to last years.  Just needs a cruise control as the engine will get you way the speed limit if you don't monitor.
suzuki,aerio,2002,Franklin E Soto, 04/15/2003,Love it,4,"I have an SUV 2002 Ford, Explorer and 
was not into buying another new car for 
the moment.
 but my wife was needing a car to do 
small things around and close to our 
home. We shopped around,Focus, Rio 
Cinco,Vibe, Protege,Saturn L200 etc.
She fell in Love with The Silver Aerio 
SX 2003. We drove it as all the rest 
2lt. 145 HP sure makes a difference, 
beautiful on the inside, great air 
condition, great CD sound, excellent 
movements, great space front and

it ,now the problem is I want to swap, 
Ford Explorer for her Susuki Aerio SX."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Cary, 11/02/2007,Good Pick 2002 SX 5M,4,"Bought this 2002 in Nov 2003 as a ""temporary"" car after the one I was dring was totaled.  Four years later, still going strong.  No real problems from SX at all.  Good room inside, plenty of head room for me (6'3"").  Nice design touches: reclining rear seats, arm rest in rear, cargo cover, height adj front seat, tilt steering,  storage tray under pass seat .  Not a huge fan of digital dash, but function can't be faulted and forward visibility is excelent.  Easy to maintain, good on tires and brakes.  MPG good but not great (28-29 most of the time), that bigger engine has its downside."

not a civic. "
suzuki,aerio,2002,Gkxp, 05/24/2003,Suzuki Aerio RULES this CLASS!!!,5,"The Aerio's interior finish/materials 
feel very Germanic (Golf-like), the 
engine is very quick off the line and 
smooth at 80MPH Highway Speeds, the 
digital dash is GREAT! The seats are 
all firm and very supportive and there 
is plenty of room.  There is also a 
TIMING CHAIN, not a timing belt as 
well as the 7 Year/100000 Mile 
Powertrain Warranty also. I would just 
recommend to anyone, before buying 
anything else in this class to cross-
shop this car, because I think you 
would find it to outperform the others 
in most categories, aside from the 
Aerio feeling more upscale and 
substantial than its price would 
suggest.        "
suzuki,aerio,2002,das12477, 03/24/2002,What a fun car!!!!!,5,I can't believe how much room there is in a car that looks small. I love my Aerio!!!
suzuki,aerio,2002,MGJ, 04/14/2008,Fun and economical,4,"I bought this car with 27k miles on it. I now have 115,000 0n it. So far the only major thing thats happened was I had to put a clutch kit in at about 87k. My daughter was trying to learn to drive a stick & I attributed  that to her slipping the clutch so much. Before I retired I drove this car almost 1000 miles a week for 3 years. It gets between 28-35 mpg on highway and a little less in the city. It is roomier and peppier that the new Honda Fit which looks like the Aerio SX. "
suzuki,aerio,2002,suki, 03/31/2002,Great car and value for little cash,5,"The SX is sporty and I loved its off-the-line acceleration even mine is an automatic.  I wish that there are more silver accent for the interior.  However, I am pretty satisfied with it."
suzuki,aerio,2002,Brian Defferding, 05/16/2008,A hidden gem,4,"Suzuki Aerios are like the perfect secret. It's a little seen car that will last forever and is a blast to drive. It has plenty of headroom (something other Japanese cars like Hondas and Toyotas sometimes lack), has a spunky engine, performs well in winter. I drive my Aerio around to conventions all around the midwest, racked up tons of miles and any repairs it needs is routine maintainence and oil changes. And the best part - they are totally affordable! I bought mine used at 52,000 miles for $7,500. If you discover this hidden gem for sale, buy it!"
suzuki,aerio,2003,mancow, 11/08/2012,Great Car,3,I bought this car new in 2003 My work round trip is 184 miles my car just went over 402000 miles I have had no problems. Just oil changes and two set of brake pads and at 250000 clutch presure plate thowout bearing all which are wearout parts.
suzuki,aerio,2003,Marlin Marx, 02/14/2016,Simplicity wins again.,5,"Simple design, simple layout, simply genius.  One of the all time best cars I have ever owned.  Rugged, dependable, useful, economical, easy to work on, and FUN!  It only had one dangerous problem.  I bought it for cheap 18 months ago in the summer and put 2,000 miles on it by winter.  Everything went well until it got really cold, and then the brakes literally ""froze up.""  Rock hard pedal and no stopping!  Scary!  My brother suggested I plumb-in an extra length of heater hose and wrap it around the brake-power-booster.  I did.  No more hard pedal, not even at 25 degrees below zero.  Now this little wonder is closer to perfect than it ever was!  Update:  It is now the fifth of March, 2017, and ""Rattles,"" as my humorous wife calls the yellow ray of sunshine, is still going strong, although I had to finally break down and put struts, rear brakes, and rear anti-sway bar bushings on it.  Small price to pay for all it does for us.  It is our parts runner, loaner car, occasional clean metal scrap delivery mule, and otherwise general gopher and ever-ready default vehicle.  It's like a Swiss Army Knife on wheels.  I can't say enough good things about it.  Precise Japanese engineering and eye-catching Italian design.  What more could anyone ask for?  Oh, and did I mention?  It's good, clean fun!  UPDATE 09/06/2017:  Still going strong, although it might be time for a front end alignment because it's pulling a little to the left.  Also, the plastic headlight housings must be about as el-cheapo as you can get because I have to work the cloudiness out of them about every three months.  I looked up the price of new ones and found that they average $220 for the pair.  Ouch.  I watched a video about changing them, and discovered it takes several hours because you have to remove most of the front end body parts to do it.  So I guess I'll keep sanding and polishing the old ones.  But it's worth it.  My wife and I took it (it took us, whatever) on a long drive through the countryside as part of our 33rd wedding anniversary celebration, and I was reminded of how good it sounds when downshifting to climb a hill or pass a farm tractor.  Fun, fun, fun.  And when we finally got home, the gas gauge needle had hardly moved.  UPDATE 09/06/2018:  Since the brakes aren't dangerous anymore in cold weather, we got to drive it enough last winter to really see how it handles snow.  Despite it's overall lightness, low ground clearance, strictly street tires, and slightly over zealous first gear ratio, it did better than expected, even through as much as 4-5 inches of wet stuff, as long as we slowed way down, planned ahead for turns and stops, and prayed continually.  During blizzards and such we used our 4x4 truck.  Less white knuckles and prayers for our hearts to slow down.  The little guy is still a blast in the summer though!  UPDATE 03/06/2019:  We are in a record breaking nasty winter with lots and lots of snow which has utterly overwhelmed our Aerio.  It has spent most of the last four months buried under a fluffy white mountain.  Before it disappeared I discovered it's factory alloy wheels must leak air in cold weather, but so slowly I didn't notice because I (shamefully) didn't check them regularly.  When I filled them to proper pressure, most of the feeling that it needed an alignment went away.  I will do better with that if I ever see it again.  UPDATE 09/07/2019:  Still going strong.  Cold AC, hot heat, always starts, always goes.  Loaded it down with multiple bags of garden dirt the other day, and it just squatted a little and soldiered home no problem.  Occasionally it has a slight ticking sound in the engine for about two minutes after cold starts.  I have come to know over time that means it's time for an oil change.  The alloy wheels are now leaking air at all temps, all the time.  I have tried to just clean alloy wheel rims in the past on
 other vehicles with limited success, so I located new Toyota steel wheels that are supposed to fit, on the internet, for $250 including tax and shipping.  Is our Suki worth that?  Oh yeah!  03/09/2020:  Alas, our Suki threw a timing chain, and since it has an interference engine, we fear the worst.  It is sitting on our car trailer until we either try to fix it, or convert it to an all-electric car; or sell parts off of it, and then scrap it.  We never ordered the Toyota wheels for it, and we won't unless we are going to do the EV conversion.  This could have been avoided if I were a better DIY mechanic..

suzuki,aerio,2003,kellynulf, 08/13/2013,LOVE MY SUZUKI,5,"I bought my Suzuki with 6 miles on it back in 2003. It now is hitting over 190,000. It has been an amazing car. There have been a few issues. A CD got stuck in the CD player and now that doesn't work. The radio still works fine though. The light on the clock doesn't work, even with replacement fuse. I did start having issues the last 2 years with the heat shield clamps rusting. Overall I will be very sad the day ""Shelly"" takes a dump."
suzuki,aerio,2003,dwvb, 10/19/2016,Love it-still running great.,5,"I bought this car used from a friend in like new condition. car was bought as a first car for my daughter, she has been driving it for over 4 years. She wasn't crazy about the car when i first bought it. Her complaints: You can not see the front bumper, you must allow extra turning room, extra room in front of you when driving, watch for curbs-ours sits low to the ground-previous owner added things to make it sporty looking.  She loves it now--she would not give it up if you asked her too.  I have kept up the servicing and except for the expensive cost of brakes and tires- I have had no other cost but oil changes and regular keep up. I Have been told by the guy who services it that parts for it are hard to get for it and that new parts for it usually need to be specially ordered and shipped in from over seas.  Our car named Midnight has 94 thousand miles,  48 thousand miles of it is ours-due to her n collage.  Car is still running strong, runs great on high grade fuel. As of 4/25/2017; {please remember we purchased our vehicle from someone we knew-not from a dealer. There was no warranty on it when we bought it.} i am still keeping up on the regular servicing for my daughter. Our guy that services it-checks everything, and i mean everything-including the cars wipers when i bring it in. Except for having to replace the radio/disc player that stopped working, I have had no other major repairs/there has been no big issues. Midnight is still running great and has almost 103 thousand miles. Today my daughter swears her car gets 36 miles to the gallon. it is more reliable then any of our other vehicles. Starts up and goes everyday.  It even runs wonderful in the snow. We have no complaints.  My daughter says she loves it and has us on the look out to pick up a second one in case something happens to Midnight-but at this time we haven't had any luck. I agreed on looking for the 2nd because I couldn't ask for a better car for her.

WoW. a lot to say about good thing. very roomy, so comfortable, very very good on gas on FWD vehicle. I had few problems on this car too. The wheel alignment goes bad so frequently. at least every year I have to do wheel alignment. Breaks are very good. Engine is so super. less noise compare to other cars on its class. The other problem is, The quality of the body, They made in cheap material. The front bomber get damaged easily. The side skirt that came with it as original also very cheap material. I don't have them in my car right now. They were flew away years ago. High way drive in fantastic. very comfortable view. Totally its a super car."

What  impresses best is that the read seats fold down truly flat.  I have fitted a washing machine and love seats, and a rolled futon mattress into this baby.   Noisy ride - can't hear radio very well at times.   Mechanically reliable for past 12 years,  only clutch needed attention at 100k miles.  I hope to get an even 200k miles out of this.   Great value for the price!!

suzuki,aerio,2003,R G, 08/07/2016,Love my car,5,"Okay, so my car is 13 hears old. I bought it used as a rental when it was a year old.  It doesn't have any of the bells and whistles like the new ones do.  Although mine did come with a 5-CD player.  I've never had to do any major repairs, all I've ever had to do was regular maintenance  (which does include some hoses, etc.).  My milage is closer to 26 to 28 mpg or better.  I do have two complaints: 1. It's too low to the ground. I've tore my bumper up on parking curbs.  2. It doesn't have enough room between the seat and the petals--for me, I have long legs for a woman--I use the same length as a 6'2"" man on the truck I drive for work.  Otherwise it's been a great car.  Dependable, comfortable, and economical.

I'm 5'11 and my husband is 6'4 and this car has enough room for us and our family of giants. I have had this same car for about 7 years now, used, and I haven't had trouble with driving in the snow. I owned it through the summer in South Florida and through the ""sno-maggedon"" in Virginia and found it to be a great vehicle for either location. I will agree it's basically plastic but I was side swiped a few years ago and it kept me safe. The cables on the battery though do fray so keep an eye under the hood ever so often. Otherwise it's money well spent."
suzuki,aerio,2003,Katherine Razzi, 06/10/2017,Best Car Ever Owned,5,"My 2003 Suzuki Aereo has been the best car I ever owned. Of course, being garage kept has a lot to do with it,  but it has only needed the bare minimum of maintenance for a lot of driving. Highway driving too!! With over 200,000 miles, she still keeps up with the fastest and picks up speed quick when needed. My only problem has been with the A/C. Had 2 mechanics try to fix it and the 1st put in a brand new compressor. Hopefully it can be repaired. Gets mighty hot around here in the summer! I saw an Aereo just like mine list for $5K. It's a good deal if she was well-kept. I intend to keep her for another 10 years if she'll have me!

A racoon took out the front bumper once...The body could be of better material. The rest inside and out is original. After all this I have not been hurt and it is still running. 200,000 miles and all I have done is changed the oil regularly, the occasional alignment, new tires and just had the radiator flushed.

The interior storage is well thought out. It has never stranded me fortunately, but I don't trust the car much. It's annoying and costly to own. It goes through tires every 20,000 miles max, even with alignments and rotation; the rear alignment lacks a key adjustment; brake rotators warp easily and brakes need replacing often; fuel economy of a big V8, and the AC belt tensioner is hard to replace and doesn't last long before it gets really noisy. The interior clock light goes off when the headlights are turned on and there other annoyances. The black velor door panels are hard to keep clean."

They stopped making these awesome cars but only God knows why. I love this car, it has been refreshingly reliable, fuel economy is awesome and I have only needed routine maintenance on it, and at 145k mi. that is great. Parking in SF is easy. I pick up all kinds of things with the cargo space. I will never buy a sedan after having a wagon.

suzuki,aerio,2003,Zavier, 02/01/2018,Wonderful Car...LONG LASTING!,5,"Purchased used instead wasting money on a monthly rental after my Jag crashed and had to fight tooth and nail to get paid from Allstate Insurance.  So this was meant to be a temporary or lets say a fill-in car.  So lets see I purchased it with 150k miles on it. Currently, at 200,000 on a car that was supposed to be meant to be basically a fill-in and disposable. I've changed the oil to full synthetic, had one $140 dollars repair to a RR Axle other than that, no-problems to speak of a great little car with more than enough room!  Engine light have a tendency to stay on..but its a just a touchy fault mechanism.  Leaving the hatch open no reason you couldn't move a sofa or furniture if needed.  Pulled off a few points for lack of arm-rests for the driver and passenger, does makes it uncomfortable for exceptionally long rides..but hey, still a great car for short trips.  Love the hatch compartments in the floor.

The car is OK, but the engine light was on and off several times during my ownership of the car. Nothing serious was found and it looked like a computer glitch. The worst part is that the car is simply not designed for the cold weather and snow driving. At freezing temperatures all pneumatics go off, like locks, windows etc, and driving under snow is a lot of stress. Overall, the cars worth its price as long as you live in the warm climate all year around."

It was cheap, and I needed a second car, that was small, economical, and a hatchback. We take our Shepherd and Boxer with us, ALOT!. I didn't give too much thought to it when I found it, except that it was in good shape, was a hatchback, and had a/c (we live in Florida). To my surprise, I've found this little car to be a real trooper. Strange looking, yes, and it does garner strange looks from passer-bys, but, the fold down rear seats, high roof line and enormous front doors have been much appreciated. We are not small people, I'm 6', partner is 6'4"", and getting in and out is a breeze. Headroom is fantastic. It's been very reliable too. Good bargain."

I agree that bumpers are kinda low.  The interior is basic.  It has a surprising amount of head room despite looking small from the outside.  I disagree with Edmund's mileage assessment.  I ALWAYS get above 30 mpg. (I have the 5 spd manual).  I plan to drive this car in to the ground and hope to get 300K miles.  The only bad thing about this car is that if you get dings and such, you can only get Suzuki parts (can be expensive relative to Toyota/Honda).  If you have a Civic or Corolla, there are TONS of aftermarket companies that make parts."
suzuki,aerio,2003,naima, 08/05/2003,Great Start Suzuki!,4,"The small footprint makes it easier to park

have no problems merging on the highway 
or passing others. Some might find the 
digital dash a little distracting but it's easy to 
get used to. All in all, I find my SX to be a 
GREAT car for the price.  If you're in the 
market for a great vehicle with lot of 
standard options, awesome safety ratings 
and is inexpensive to boot, the Aerio SX is a 
fantastic buy. It's a nice for a new family too.

more than the Aerio.
 The Protoge 5 was suprisingly small 
inside and didnt exhibit the 
performance that it's apperamce

 the ZX5 was ok, and the $3000 back 
also madeit look attractive, but at the 
end of the day, I just couldn't get 
past the fit and finish of the car.
 The Aerio SX gives you flexability,

Every Suzuki I see on the road is missing the same front and back pieces on the front and back bumper... both pieces fell off on their own. Of course in 2009 I had well over 130K miles on this baby because I traveled A LOT in it so my car never had any major problems... Another thing you might want to know is if you get into an accident with the body parts being so cheap your car will most likely get totaled.

I also flush out the transmission ever 40k which I do to all the cars I own, and I change the oil every 3500 miles. The car requires low profile tires (because it handles like its on rails), I recommend Goodyear traction t/a's. I've been able to get 70k miles on them before replacing them. The original tires only lasted about 30k."
suzuki,aerio,2003,jlandshark, 12/03/2002,Fun for tiny bucks,4,"I have around 10,000 miles on the car 
now. It has been a fun car to drive 
with great gas milage. For going to and 
from work it can not be beat. Lots of 
interesting looks and questions from 
others on the street. Way cheaper and 
faster than the Protege5 and the Matrix."
suzuki,aerio,2003,Veronica2, 12/06/2002,new review,4,"Overall the vehicle is pleasant to 
drive, quiet and responsive.  The 6-
disc, 6 speaker cd player is great but 
causes the door panels to vibrate when 
loud or when bass is at optimum level.
The back lit feature on the player is 
not a plus as it washes out in 
sunlight."
suzuki,aerio,2003,traisjag, 12/05/2002,2003 SX Great car for the $'s,4,"1. Bought the car through the internet, 
best car purchase ever...save $'s and 
was in and out in 1.5 hours!
2. Great value for the dollar! Great 
room (I'm 6'1"" and there is plenty of 
room, even for the back seat passengers)
and features. 
3. The ABS and AWD are a great team for 
the price.
I just love this car, yes the style is 
different, but I like being different!"

suzuki,aerio,2003,jontyrees, 12/09/2002,"So far, so good....",4,"I'm finding my '02 Aerio SX, (wagon), 
to be a very pleasant companion so far. 
I have the 5-speed, 0-60mph in the 8.0-
8.4 sec range will let you scoot past 
most of the behemoths on the road. It's 
incredibly manouverable, and the 
handling is ok if a little bit too 
softly sprung.

Interior design and space management is 
excellent - with cargo space matching 
that of small to mid-size SUVs like the 
Saturn Vue and Nissan Xterra. The seats 
are comfortable and supportive, 
controls are well placed, and the 
digital dash is terrific for visibility 
and speed of comprehension.

Overall, I really like this car."

surrounding areas, putting on the 
average of about 250 miles per day. I 
drive this car hard.  

For the most part this car has 
outperformed itself. It has handled 
well in the rain, and has stood up to 
grid locked traffic in 100 degrees 
weather. I have taken turns around 
freeway corners at up to 85 miles an 
hour with ease.  Coming equipped  with  
low profile tires (195 55 15), I found 
a 60
to look better. I didn't like all the 
space in the wheel well.  


  Overall this car is something I 
consider special even though it is 
completely built by maCHINES.  "

purchased this car for economical 
reasons. I drove an Integra that was 
quick and love to drive fast. This car 
is fairly zippy for fun driving downtown 
and is comfortable on highways.

It's faster thasn the Protege 5, Toyota 
Camry and cheaper than a Civc once 
you add all of the sporty features.

I'd like to try and sell it before my 
lease is up so I hope it holds it's 
value well!"
suzuki,aerio,2003,hankr, 08/05/2003,Best in Class,4,"Aerio beats the competition in comfort, 
roominess, power (esp low-end torque), 
offset crash tests, standard features, 
generous transferrable warranty and a 
low price. I cross-shopped many 
others and bought the Aerio; spent 
less, got more, with no regrets 
after 4 months.

Don't be swayed by reviewers who simply 
dislike the styling &/or 
digital dash. This car is very 
competitive.

It is what it is; an economy car. But  
see your way beyond Ford, Toyota and 
Honda when shopping in this class, and 
Suzuki has a very pleasant surprise for 
you; more car for much less money."

about 3 months now and for the most

great value, lots of fun to drive and 
lots of room for 4 adults.  Seats are 
very comfortable, acceleration is good 
although it gets a little noisy in the 
higher revs.  5 speed isn't as precise 
as Honda or Toyota, but it's not bad.  
For the money / features - can't 
complain!!  Much less than a Cruiser or 
Vibe / Matrix and more features.  Have 
added console, dash cover, front air 
deflector, door protection mouldings, 
rear cargo carpet and bumper strip - 
looks good !!!"

in my 03 SX 5 speed after 9500 miles.  
Front brakes clunked. Front door 
panels buzzed constantly. A loud dash 
rattle occured twice. The fog lights 
and hood were loose. And the car had 
an annoying driveline bucking problem 
combined with a loss of power.  Fuel 
economy on the highway was a 
disappointment (29.5) and so was the 
power.  The engine is way too loud (it 
isn't smooth either) and wind noise is 
loud starting at 60mph.  The doors 
have a tinny sound quality to them and 
the fabric on the door panels started 
showing wear after only 3k.  The Aerio 
is extremely roomy and comfortable 
though.  "

for the price, great sound, cute car,
lots of storage, good gas mileage. - the
door mouldings on the inside rattle. I
can't configure the tilt and seat

am a past suzuki owner and have been
impresseg with their line-up right from
the days of the sj410 (samurai). The
only drawback I see to the Aerio is the
lack of aftermarket performane
enhancements like an exhaust kit . K and
N makes a typhoon kit for the car and it
makes a bit of difference in the
performance and a substantial difference
in fuel economy. As I am a tall man,

suzuki,aerio,2003,belden, 05/30/2005,good car watch resale value,4,"Have enjoyed this car. Moves well although not so fast at picking up speed and up major hills works hard. Winshield defrost is not so good.  The left and right sides of windshiel do not defrost well.  Usually have to scrape when frosted. Side mirrors not too stable, jiggle in the wind.  Overall, decent car if you can get at a decent price.  "
suzuki,aerio,2003,LiquidZero, 12/04/2003,Dirt cheap and FUN!,4,"First off, I got a sweet deal buying 
this car, and walked out the door 
paying only $12,000.  

Now that's out of the way... this car 
is simply fun to drive for an 
econobox.  It may not be the fastest 
car around, but it surprises a lot of 
people with it's pep.  Plenty of 
headroom and storage room.  With a 5-
spd it gets great gas mileage.  Much 
better than the EPA estimates.  
Handles well in turns, if just a bit 
hesitantly.  There is significant body 
roll, because of it's height, but I've 
never felt like it was about to lose 
contact with the road.  A bit too 
early to say anything on reliability, 
but so far so good."
suzuki,aerio,2003,magnum1, 12/07/2003,AERIO IS WONDERFUL,5,"It's the best car I have ever owned. I love my 
2002 Suzuki AERIO GS. I purchased it in July of 
2002 and now have 35,000 miles on it and 
haven't spent a dime on it except for oil 
changes and general maintenance, which is 
very little. This includes changing 
transmission fluid (standard) and flushing the 
radiator."
suzuki,aerio,2003,aerio_sx_man, 12/20/2003,Best for the money,4,"Well, it's only been three days since I 
purchased it, but I spent probably 40 
hours researching this vehicle.  What I 
needed was a second car that could get 
me to the airport weekly, make an 
occassional cross state drive (3 
hours), and have the room for 2 adults 
and 2 small children when needed in a 
pinch.  NOt mention the ability to drop 
the rear seats and create a huge bed 
for furniture, supplies or whatnot.  
This is that vehicle.  I got rid of a 
95 Taurus sedan for the Aerio SX AWD.  
It's economical, it's inexpensive, and 
with the 0% interest from Suzuki, it 
makes a compelling story to buy new 
vehicle versus used.  Just my .02 
cents.  "
suzuki,aerio,2003,tcw, 12/20/2003,great so far,4,"Only minor complaints. Wish it got more

I'd like it to! Smooth transmission. "

So far I have replaced the automatic transmission, California air emissions controls,the rear rim,I am not hard on a car. My front passenger side has been filled with rain water 4 times as the drainage hose from the hood to under the car keeps letting go & dumps the rain into the car. The base of my battery cable corroded & has taken over 2 weeks a new factory part. I feel like I have been on timeshare with my dealer. I should have relinquished the car after the 4th trip for the transmission prior to replacement. I'm out of warranty & it is getting expensive!"

snow and has enough zip to get up some 
of the steeper passes I encounter. 
There is plenty of room inside for 
four skiers plus our stuff. The sound 
system is great and because of its 
unusal design, it is easy to spot in 
parking lots. My only complaint are 
the Yokahama tires. I have already 
replaced two. Outside of that, and for 
the price, this wagon is terrific."

The digital instrument panel and HVAC

still, for 8mo of use it should not be

It has plenty of get up and go, the gas mileage is not as good as my Swift's was, but it doesn't do badly at all.  I get about 32 miles per gallon on highway.  I live in the desert and I drive the state highway all the time.  I do not do any city driving at any length.  I have had no repairs done except for scheduled maintenance.  I now have had nearly 50,000 miles of touble free driving, which is very important in the middle of the CA desert. "
suzuki,aerio,2003,Tomgunn, 03/20/2003,Unique and an absolute joy to drive,4,"This car is the best affordable AWD 
car $ for $.  My expectations were far 
exceeded."
suzuki,aerio,2003,Dinslaken, 10/28/2006,Beware,2,"This car has a lot of value for the money and the first 48,000 miles were trouble free. The engine needed oil frequently, which is not that bad, but despite more maintenance than required, the engine blew at 48,560 miles, then the transmission went at 54,000 miles. The axle seals were replaced twice, and the brakes need replacement about every 10,000 miles. The worst part is that Suzuki refused to honor their ""Best Warranty"" on both occasions due to ""lack of proven component failure."" According to other owners, this problem is increasing. Suzuki was sued for both instances, and we were reimbursed by court order. Other than that....nice car!"
suzuki,aerio,2003,jzarli, 03/23/2003,Price DOES matter!,5,"Read Edmunds Compact Wagon Comparison 
test. Don't most of us establish a 
budget as the first rule of auto buying?
Wouldn't you pick a Ford Escape, bigger 
& better over a Matrix, as they are 
similar in price? For 2003 the Aerio 
has a bit more HP & Torque. It did 
pretty well in the comparison, but the 
2003 would likely finish #1.  Note the 
2003 now has the 6CD changer/radio 
standard. Who likes the fake metal 
interior trim of a Matrix??"
suzuki,aerio,2003,dnrportch, 01/20/2007,Can Anyone Get Parts for These Cars?,2,"You can't get parts for the Aerio in a timely manner. Example one: the transmission went out in 2006. It was still under extended warranty, but it took 6 weeks to get the parts and it had to be repaired twice. We have a great dealer. It's the car and the factory. The car runs fine now. Example two: after a low speed collision with a deer (he jumped on the hood while chasing another deer across the road in front of us!) we had two dealers try to order replacement parts on three separate occasions.  The parts never arrived! It's been eighteen months. You should also know that the car is terrible in wet snow or snow over ice. It is geared too powerfully relative to the weight of the car. I like the gas mileage it gets, but would not buy another."

and I love all of the looks I get.  
I've been looking for about 3 months 
now.  I've driven every car in it's 
class and this is by far the best buy 
for your money.  With the $2000 rebate 
or 0% interest rate, it's much cheaper 
than the Toyota Matrix and the Pontiac 
Vibe.  There is much more room in the 
back seat.  There's a built in cover 
for your privacy of articles in the 
trunk.  The reversable floor mat and 
water bucket are very nice.  There's 
lots of storage in the rear and an 
additional cup holder for the back

For example, the suspension needs to be upgraded, the engine needs a performance boost but the overall car is fine. The only complaint I have is the Suzuki should have promoted the Aerio for the long haul but instead they dropped the model just like the Esteem model line.  The transferable warranty is makes them a good used car buy.   "

sedan/crossover category for a few 
months. On a whim I test drove the 
Susuki Aerio SX. Initially I was 
skeptical that a car of this price 
could pack in the features that it 
does. When compared. with the 
Matrix/Vibe I was sold. 14000 hard 
miles later, I continue to be 
impressed. I get 31-35 MPG at highway 
speeds and I love the interior room ( 
Im 6'4"" )Actually, this is my third 
Suzuki, I owned a Samuri for many years 
while living in USVI and was never let 
down by the rugged engineering and 
reliabilty especially when you consider

previous car was a Geo Metro), tons of 
standard features, and a great

highway is always a funny journey. I 
was stopped at the Tolls in NH to be 
asked who made the car and what it was!!
Love the car. Ride is great, and the

It is fun to drive and as a bigger guy I found myself strangly comfortable in this car and not pressed up against the window like some other cars. Overall a great and dependable car. Only thing I did was get 15"" rims and tires, which helped with road noise and turning performance."
suzuki,aerio,2003,Ron, 11/25/2007,Incredibly reliable experience,4,"We bought this Suzuki as a commute vehicle for my wife.  It's simply been an incredible experience, as the car has been not only a lot of fun to drive, but it has been reliable beyond all expectations.  With only normal dealer maintenance service, we have not had a single mechanical problem.  As a huge bonus, the handling, braking, steering, and utility have all been enjoyed and utilized a tremendous amount.  "

Excellent fuel economy, sporty ride and looks.  Had to put a new clutch in at 53k.  Possibly due to some student drivers learning to drive a manual trans.  The wobbly side mirrors are a recall item I have not got to yet.  CD player has a disc stuck in it, outside temp light is burned out... minor things that can go after many years of good service.  Never let me down mechanically.  As is probably the norm, wife gets the nice ride, kids get the safe, dependable ride. "

The room in such a tiny-looking car is unbelievable. Awesome standard features, like alloy wheele, a great 6-cd Clarion stereo, power everything, cruise, tilt, and storage galore. And ho-boy did I save money compared to a Protege5, Vibe, or Matrix. All of these cost so much more with the same equipment, yet do not have the pep of my Aerio."

to put away little things under the 
passenger's seen and in the back.  It 
has a modern look to it from the

Cold Winter starts have been no problem

wonderful for Winter, although it does 
take a slight change in driving style

to accustomize to taking corners 
properly in an AWD on ice.  But now

This was my first new car and I am so glad I bought it.  I have treated it well and changed the oil every 3,000 and got a tune up(spark plugs and stuff) at 100,000. I have went through some brakes and a few tire changes.  The car has 140,000 miles on it and will be 6 years old next month.

I drove it from Columbus, OH to Cincinnati, Dayton, Mansfield, and Indianapolis, IN as part of my job as a manufacturer's rep until early 2009 and usually got 28 to 30 mpg on the highway.  I have over 156,000 miles on the car and have had minimal problems (in fact the only one was the replacement of a catalytic converter), but I change the oil every 3K to 5K miles, and have had two or three brake jobs and one engine tune-up with new platinum plugs plus about three tire (all 4) changes.  Even with all the miles it has had very reasonable maintainence costs.  Too bad Suzuki dropped this model for a smaller version of it."

I bought it brand new and put almost every single mile on it myself.
Other than utterly routine stuff, I've done virtually nothing to this car.
Even the routine repairs may well be more due to my driving style than defects in the car.
As a matter of fact, I think I'm still using the original batter on the thing.

suzuki,aerio,2004,13Edge, 02/04/2006,A Car For Any Season,4,"If you are looking for 0-60 acceleration or fast and furious performance, don't get an AWD Aerio. The automatic tranny just won't allow it. The interior is well designed with the controls for everything placed just right. The car is very comfortable for my 6'3"" 280 lb. frame. The factory radio is incredible and with the rear seats folded down I can fit more things in this than the old S-10 Blazer I had. This car really shines in bad weather. It handles snow and rain like a champ, and it eats up country dirt roads. All in all, with the interior room, all weather capability, and storage space, you almost feel like you are driving an SUV... except this has more standard features that most SUVs."

As smooth as a Camry and quieter than a Civic sedan on highway. Solid handling even in inclement weather. Handling in high gusty wind is manageble and not troublesome. I have the off-white pearl color which hides dirt well. So far, no paint issues. Stereo is hi-fi quality, not sizzly/boomy. AC cooling is adequate. Engine tends to ping in hot weather (85% plus) under load conditions (hills with AC on, or steep hills in general). 89 Octane alleviates problem. Otherwise runs fine on 87 octane.

This is a style of automaking that 
should go the way of the dinosaur. The

Interior has more room than you would suspect.  I don't like the all black interior as every little thing shows up. The AWD had been great in snow and on ice. With all the winter driving we've done, only once did we bury it and that was human error.

We shopped around and bought two AWD Aerios which drive great (especially in the snow) can carry alot and, just as I found with their motorcycles, very reliable. Gas prices? I drive just as much as I please, loving my Suzuki, in any weather. We dig our Suzukis!"
suzuki,aerio,2004,Fred, 03/14/2009,Excellent,4,A very nice car im suprised it didnt sell as much as corolla and other cars in class. It fits big rims plenty power a all around fun car.

i saw the car i was hesitant, but as 
soon as I got inside and saw all the 
cute original features that the car 
has, I fell in love.  I've had my car 
now for four months and I'm so happy.  
I hope it lasts a long time with me.  =)"
suzuki,aerio,2004,Aligirl, 04/03/2004,The Aerio SX,4,"The Aerio SX is a real peppy and safe 
feeling car.  It's looks a little ""egg 
shaped"" which isn't always eye 
appealing however great for kids.  
Additionally the only interior color 
you can get is black.  Why not have a 
neutral interior color more earth tone."
suzuki,aerio,2004,Jessie0405, 09/06/2004,Very Bad Paint,2,"I have had trouble with the paint job 
in the first year and again now.
Paint chipped in places that would not 
normally be touched by hands, rocks or 
anything else for that matter.  On the 
trunk edges, by the driverside back 
window.  Large chips that rusted.  Many 
tiny rust spots.  Big ones were fixed 
at the local dealership.  Told it could 
be the pearlized paint as it is softer 
than normal.
Having the same problems again.  Chips 
in the paint that are rusting, tiny 
pinholes all over that are rusted.
Took it back to dealer, they advised me 
that was normal wear and tear.  
It is not!!!
They just want me to buy a new car.
Left dealership very unhappy!"
suzuki,aerio,2004,Doug/Florida, 09/27/2003,To new to tell about reliability,4,"This car is fun to drive,very quick 
with 155hp.It moves.  Car has all 
luxery power,and remotes you would 
want on any car ALL standard,also 
heater and power out side mirrors. 
Don't look at the 2003's look at the 
2004's alot of new standard equipment 
for 2004. Out the door $17,500.  [WITH]
the total extended warranty 10 year 
bumper to bumper only $550.00"
suzuki,aerio,2004,jeffrok, 10/11/2003,"Gets me from here to there, no problems.",4,"$3,000 cheaper than the competition and 
a 7 year warranty!

Pros:
Good mileage in automatic or manual.
Different looking, making it easy to 
find in a parking lot.
Nice seats
Great stock radio (6 CD changer, 6 
speakers)
Tons more head and legroom than the 
Protege5..

Cons:
Narrow, tall styling makes it lean 
quite a bit in sharp turns
Different looking, making some people 
smirk at your car
Engine is a little growly at highway 
speeds, but not too bad..
No factory sunroof option
You have to remove the headrests to 
fold the back seats down
Dash isn't sporty enough.

Hopefully it's a good winter car..    I 
hope I don't regret not opting for the 
AWD."
suzuki,aerio,2004,luvmysuzuki, 03/03/2005,Great Little Car,4,"After an accident rendered my wife's Escort undriveable we decided to replace it with something just as economical but we wanted something with a little more pizzaz.We didn't have a lot of money to spend so the Corollas and Civics were priced out of our range.We briefly considered a Hyundai or Kia but just didn't get the warm fuzzy feeling with them.As soon as we sat in the Aerio we were hooked.The headroom is massive (enough to accomodate a six foot tall person with inches to spare).There are more standard features on this car than you can shake a stick at (AC,6 disc CD,PW,PDL and heated mirrors are standard!).We average almost 30 MPG and as far as power....Buckle up and hang on!!!

suzuki,aerio,2004,Janell19, 11/05/2003,Good car,5,"I drove my Aerio from Wa state to Texas 
and back on each drive we averaged 
about 32 miles to the gallon. In town I 
get about 30- 40. I was a comfortable 
car as well as hardly any one had seen 
one yet so it made it that much more 
fun."

That was a good small car but this is a significant improvement all around.  Tall drivers should try it.  Feels very secure in inclement weather. Really not a problem in high wind. No paint problems on this one (white pearl color). My first digital dash and adjusted easily to it. AC is adequate for me but some people may need more. So far mileage is low to mid 30's on highway and mid 20's round town. Fortunately this car runs just fine on Kroger 87 octane. So save your pennies! "

Couldn't find a decent used car so I took all the incentives (military, graduate, end of model year...) and got this Aerio for under 10K!  Wow, what a surprise, the stereo sounds awesome and the five speed manual has alot of pep. I bought the optional roof rack and now I carry a 12 foot kayak on the roof every weekend.  Definitely a fun, reliable, economical ride, and I even had a kid say ""cool car"" to me...  This care definitely supports my hobbies and budget"

has suffcient power to pass at 75-80mph 
and has smoothly purred at 109 on a 
flat road on a hot sunny day.Even at 
high speed the car handled well with 
little roll and lower rpm's than 
expected.  The interior has room for 
such a small car, the AC kicks butt 
over the toyota matrix, vibe and honda 
civic - in Phoenix it is good to test 
drive in mid summer for back seat AC 
performance.Fully loaded at base it was 
the most logical decision to make over 
the competition."

buck!  The Aerio SX comes fully loaded -
- options that cost extra on the Toyota 
and Mazda cars.  The Aerio is a fun to 
drive, reliable, economical vehicle -- 
offering room for 4 full size adults (5

the Aerio Sedan has 2 problems, one of 
them major.  Until the engine warms up 
(takes 5 minutes+) the automatic 
transmission will not shift from 3rd 
to 4th gear.  This occurs even in warm 
weather until the engine itself is 
warm (not related to exterior 
temperature).  Also, the cup holders 
are bloched by the gear selector."

My car creaks and clunks in the front and rear.  I took it back to the dealer several times for service and was always told the carriage bolts were loose and were tightened.  This went on about every three months.  Next was the noise from the brakes, then the radio went out and was replaced, gas peddle stuck and throttle was replaced.  My car's suspension is still making all these noises and dealer states again all Aerio's do this.  For some reason, the radio does not work when rear defroster is on.  Now the car's front wheel bearings had to be replaced.  The suspension still makes all kinds of noises.  I have a lawyer handling my car as a lemon."

Has great torque for the mountains I 
had to go over (from Salt Lake to Reno)-
wouldn't pull down, would downshift and 
kept right up with the big dogs when 
ascending. For an economy car, there 
isn't anything I didn't like about it.

Swift.  Having a previous good 
experience with my Suzuki Swift, I 
bought a 2002 Suzuki Aerio with the 
2.0L 4 Cylinder.  I loved it so much, 
I went back to Suzuki and bought 
another!  The power improvement 
for '04 is VERY noticeable without a 
penalty in MPG.  Suzuki also addressed 
the lack of a driver armrest and my 
2004 seems much quieter on the inside 
(engine is very quiet on 
both).  I would suggest to would-be 
compact class buyers to test drive an 
Aerio after driving an Echo, Corolla, 
Civic or Scion XA or XB & I'm sure 
you'll be impressed!"

thats about it. Handles very poorly, 
Interior is made of cheap quality.

doubts having never owned a Suzuki, but 
I'm glad I took a chance. I am baffled 
by Edmunds reviews, which are, in large 
part, luke-warm.  But I read other 
great reviews and test drove it anyway. 
I traded my '02 Elantra for my Aerio.  
The Elantra,it was comfortable, a good 
value and performer. But the 
Aerio has more personality, HP and 
better safety scores.  As for the 
handling being ""sloppy""....not so, it 
does lean a lil more at times than the 
Elantra (taller profile) but it grips 
the road as well.  The steering feel is 
similar.... nimble with being too 
light. Getting in and out of the Aerio 
is easier too"

the exact same car again.  It fits my 
use perfectly.  I researched other 
wagons but found the Aerio SX was far 
superior in meeting the needs I have 
for carrying my agility dog around yet 
having plenty of room for passengers.  
It's fun and comfortable to drive and

We were so impressed that we bought 
two of them.  The AWD is great we live 
in Northern Michigan - lots of snow 
and ice. They handled as well as our 
previous Subaru! Less ground clearance 
but I didn't get stuck once! How about 
room?  I'm 6'6"" but plenty of leg and 
especially headroom. OK - the interior 
isn't fancy but functional and solid.  
Great pep in the small engine - it 
doesn't hesitate to move you down the 
road. With the extras like a 6 CD 
player and a very nice sound system - 
solid heater and AC - this is a great 
car for the money.  I'm getting 29 mpg

have room for plants, dog & more. It is 
roomy, great looking, very comfortable

an SUV or a gas guzzler either! MPG is 
great; it looks hi-tech; it has 
everything inside you need; a great 
CD/radio sound quality.  I owned luxury 
cars, but do 
not drive long distances anymore & 
wanted a car that is smooth driving, 
easy to handle and fun to drive. If 
you're looking for a good deal, happy

suzuki,aerio,2004,MAD777, 08/02/2004,04 Aerio SX -- Best Blend,4,"I tested a HUGE number of cars before 
buying. I found the Aerio peppy (pulls 
well in any gear and handles most 
hills with cruise on in 5th gear), 
eager to go, great confident cornering 
(unlike the Vibe/Matrix which scared 
my wife and I when we drove it after 
testing the Suzuki -- we were never 
sure where the Vibe/Matrix was going 
to go when going into turns, and they 
required constant mid-course 
correction). Can't understand Edmund's 
review that handling is sloppy on the 
Aerio SX! Did the reviewer check the 
tires for proper inflation? I think it 
deserves another review! Could use a 
bit more storage, better cup holders,

ONE.  Most consumer mags are not in my 
opinion very complimentary towards this

other vehicles that look like it, they 
nock the styling, handling, and some 
how conclude that the interior material 
is cheap or low quality material. I

suzuki,aerio,2004,indiecds, 10/17/2004,Not Perfect But I Love It!,4,"Bought w/10,000 miles on it and have 
driven it 5,000. The car handles fine 
for me.  Each driver needs to decide 
their own priorities. Two of the  
Yokohama 195/55R15s wore out in 15,000 
miles. This size tire cost $100 at 
most locations so I changed to 14 inch 
size designated for the base S model 
with 185/65R14 tires that are 1/3 the 
cost and warranteed for more miles.  
While this does reduce handling it 
improves the ride & seems more 
practical if you view this car as an 
economy AWD vehicle. Viewing it as a 
sporty AWD vehicle requires sticking 
with the 15 in wheels & tires. Running 
lights are too easy to mistake for 
headlights on. Should be an audible 
warning when low fuel light comes on."

I experienced absolutely no problems and had a comfortable ride.  The high winds had no effect on the drive, despite the side gust warning in the owner's manual.  I made the same trip in a Toyota Echo a couple of years ago and almost ended up in a ditch several times."
suzuki,aerio,2004,misskellu, 07/13/2005,Still feels like new,4,I bought my Aerio S new in Dec 2003 and still enjoy driving it as much as I did the first week. It's small and easy to park but feels roomy inside. Its high profile makes it comfortable to get in and out and also provides good visibility. I'm tall and it's the first compact that I've had where I didn't feel like my backside is dragging on the ground while I'm driving or that I have to fall into the seat and haul myself out. I can pretty much just step in & out. The handling is decent on the freeway I have no problem accellerating to pass. The engine is very quiet while idling and has a nice lil growl when you punch it. I live in a hilly city and the automatic scales them with ease.
suzuki,aerio,2004,Angie Spradling, 06/06/2018,Got in a wreck and it held up like a big car,5,"It's tech is really first class. It's such a small car would think it wouldn't hold up to a big car. But I had less damage than the big car.

suzuki,aerio,2004,Alexis Vargas, 12/26/2019,Awesome 4 door sedan,5,"Inexpensive, easy and fun to drive. Excellent for a 4 door sedan. Great trunk capacity. Fog lamps, heating seats and heating side mirrors, all electric doors, windows. Good on gas, oh and 6 cd changer❗️

suzuki,aerio,2005,Glen-Tacoma-WA, 11/07/2004,A Good Pocket Rocket,4,"I commute 158 miles round trip every
weekday, so was looking for a reliable,
economical, and fun to drive car at a
good price point. What I got in the 2005
Suzuki Aerio SX Sport Wagen surpassed my
requirements. With it's 155 hp engine,
it's pretty darn quick, and it sticks to
the road in corners really well. The
handling is excellent, but the steering
could be a little crisper and more
responsive. New for 2005 is the Techno
Blue Metal paint color. It's beautiful.
While I initially didn't like the body
styling all that much, it's been growing
on me. It looks a little boxy at first.
The interior is very comfortable. The
instrument panel glows crimson red at
night. Awesome."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Dan, 07/22/2006,Perfect For What I Do,5,"I'm a regional sales manager and cover at least 25,000 miles a year.  When fuel prices started to go up, I traded my Suzuki XL-7 (88,000 troublefree miles) for an Aerio SX wagon.  Never liked the Aerio SX wagon design, but it grew on me; now I love it.  I wanted AWD, but it's not offered with the manual transmission.  I had to have the manual.  After my first test drive, I said, ""This is a blast.""  And it is unbelievable how much room is in this car!  I haul a lot of stuff.  I even bought a rooftop carrier for those extra big loads.  I'm 6'2"" and could wear a Stetson hat in it.  It seats four passengers very well.  I always get at least 33 mpg, even when city driving is mixed in.  37 mpg is the most I've gotten, and it has plenty of power."
suzuki,aerio,2005,leigh2, 06/10/2013,Wish I could buy another!!,4,"I bought this in January '08 with 35k miles on it.
After having a Caravan & Suburban..... I could not be happier!!
It is finally getting ready for semi-retirement with 206k miles on it.
I drive 500-700 miles/week.
Outside of regular routine maintenance {Oil changes, tires, brakes, transmission flushes} I have no other issues with this car until recently and that would be due to ""old age.""

The seats are not that comfortable for my frame but I have enjoyed every minute of this car.
The cargo space is unbelievable for the size!
I can fit 2 people, 2 - 90 lb. dogs and gear for an overnight hiking trip without issue.

I'd go for the SX4 in a heartbeat if they hadn't made it smaller."
suzuki,aerio,2005,deg, 09/29/2010,Heck of a car,5,"Bought used with 48,000 miles on it, now well over 140,000 on it and other then tires and brakes this car runs perfect. Best little car I have ever owned"
suzuki,aerio,2005,khunt2, 10/24/2012,Extremely Dangerous on Highways,2,"The 2005 Suzuki Aerio is a danger on the highways because the front axles may suddenly break without warning!! In July 2011 while in a parking lot about to make a left turn from a stopped position, the left front axle broke. The dealer's shop replaced Control Arm only. Two weeks later, went someplace else & had wheels aligned because car vibrating badly. Found CV joint damaged & boot ripped. CV joint replaced Sept. 2012. Oct. 2012, while stopped at a corner about to make a right turn, the right front axle broke. Called Suzuki in Calif. but they aren't interested in the danger. Owners should stay off of highways and have front end carefully checked at once under strong light. "
suzuki,aerio,2005,cmquimby, 08/13/2005,Excellent AWD economy car,5,"I have owned my Aerio LX AWD for about 8 months. It gets great gas mileage, I average about 29 mpg in combined city and highway driving.  The climate control works perfectly.   The six disc in-dash Clarion CD changer and seven speaker stereo (including subwoofer) make up a high end system for such an inexpensive car.  The Aerio has decent power (155 hp), but I do wish that they offered the AWD version with a manual transmission.  Dry weather handling is very good, I have improved the handling of mine with a larger than stock rear swaybar. "
suzuki,aerio,2005,MESX, 01/28/2006,Don't Buy One!,2,"I have had nothing but problems with my Suzuki Aerio. Its bushings came out of the sway bar four times before it was finally fixed by having new modified ones installed.  I had the  viscous coupling replaced for AWD, had power door lock fail, had all four tires replaced due to factory alignment defect destroying them, and the rims are all scratched and gouged from several attempts to repair all the defects.  I still have a clunking noise from the front end. Also, the styrofoam is detached from the rear bumper (behind exterior plastic) and the gas mileage is poor."
suzuki,aerio,2005,BrianS, 06/11/2008,"Poor tires, brakes, and shocks",3,"The car is amiable. But I had to change all 4 tires at 18000k's and the front disc brakes at 30,000k and I was told the rear shocks are on their way out. To say nothing about the sticking shifter. At 70 years of age, I am hardly a cowboy behind the wheel.  "
suzuki,aerio,2005,Jess, 10/15/2008,Much more than expected,5,"I bought the Aerio SX after surgery because it allowed easy in and out access, and have ended up falling in love with it over the last four years!  This car is exceptionally well made (the Japanese are famous for this!) and outperforms many of the more expensive autos I've owned such as Volvo, BMW, Cadillac, VW and MG.  Great gas mileage, ultra reliable, has remained tight and rattle free, and shows little wear over the years. Yes, the front bumper is low, and I'd prefer larger tires, but hey, overall no complaints at all with this little gem! The anti-lock brakes and AWD are life savers over and over again. Transmission smooth as silk. Best value for reasonable price!"
suzuki,aerio,2005,aeriohawaii, 03/25/2005,Hawaiian Aerio SX,4,"I have had the Aerio SX for about 1 month now.  The mpg has improved to about 28.  The ride is a little firm.  But it is Nice to sit up High in the car.  Everything has been pretty good, Except it seems that the Left-Side of the car doors, not Not Close and Latch well.  I Really Enjoyed the stereo witht he Suwoofer  and the 6 CD changer.  I Wish that he wheels were a little Bigger, 16 inchers would be nice."
suzuki,aerio,2005,mike hall, 03/27/2005,you got to drive one,4,"i am a mystery shopper full time and needed a car for traveling .i put the aero to the test first week of ownership with a trip from nc to fla 1000 miles roundtrip. first tank of gas i averaged 38 mph and the drive was quick and smooth.i do lots of stops in a day ,my husband drives so some days the car is not turned off for 10 hours i have found that the aero is up to the task and performs unbelievable .it was more than i expected and for the price i would say ,go for it"
suzuki,aerio,2005,john phillips, 04/01/2005,My suzuki,4,"This is a perfect second car. Great interior room,i'm 6 ft 1. excellent mileage and great dealer service.The standard features on the Sx model are great,a/c,5 disc, stereo,cruise,etc. I'm very happy with my little car."
suzuki,aerio,2005,tony, 04/30/2005,Best In Class,4,"I must be honest. My other car is a Porsche, so I expect alot from a car. I have an SX version, red with auto trans. This car is great for an all around commuter - 28 mpg, lots of room for passengers and cargo with more power than anything else for 15,500. Most Materials for the interior are outstanding for price. I think it compares well with the likes of Honda CRV and Hyundai Tuscon, if you don't need the extra 10-15 cubic feet of cargo space - especially with the Aerio being $5-7,000 less. The handling could be a little crisper with flatter cornering, but the red dash lights and the supurb stereo system more than makes up for it. I don't seem to be driving my Porsche so much."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Ron Pink, 08/16/2005,"Price, warranty, and economy",5,"I love my Aerio, especially its great fuel economy.  At 65 miles per hour I am getting 35 to 40 mpg which has been a great suprise since it was rated at 25 and 32 respectively."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Max, 08/16/2005,A car for Canadian Winters,4,"We purchased the Aerio for my wife based on budget, safety and AWD.  My wife had not driven in 7 years so I wanted something really safe for her.  What we ended up with was so much more.  My first drive in the snow made me love this car.  What a tank!  I was plowing through side roads and averting traffic, while driving as if it where a spring day.  Anyone that has to deal with a Canadian winter should drive this car. We even managed to fit a loveseat into the car with the rear seats down!  European styling and decent handling make this a pretty good all round car.  Our other car is a 1995 Honda Civic and I have to say I am going to have a hard time deciding whether to trade in for Honda or Suzuki."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Jaime Ramirez, 09/01/2005,Fun small car,5,"My Suzuki Aerio is small, practical, and my kids love it.  My wife drives it more the our SUV. It turns heads, and most of all with prices of gas now it's a winner."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Kathy, 05/10/2006,"Love it ,Love It, Love It",4,"I purchased my Aerio after driving my son's 2003 Aerio. I love how easily it handles and boy what acceleration for a compact car!  It gets great gas mileage too. The interior is redesign from the '03's, which is a real positive.  I'm very satisfied."
suzuki,aerio,2005,amentzriona, 07/08/2006,Peppy Aerio SX AWD,4,"Initially, when I brought this vehicle, I was terrified by the gas mileage that I originally had. I wasn't happy with the it and I spoke with the dealership. They told me that it was normal and that it would get better within the next 5,000 miles. I was really skeptical but they were true to their word. I currently have 10,000 miles on the car and I never regret my decision on buying this vehicle."
suzuki,aerio,2005,kathy, 12/20/2004,Fun to drive!,5,"Love it!!! Roomy, easy to handle, fun 
to drive, nice cd, lot of car for the 
money."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Jess, 02/19/2005,The Little BIG Car!,5,"After renting two Aerios, once to drivefrom Seattle to Portland, OR, and back, and second to use for a week in Palm Springs, CA, I literally fell in love with this powerful, frisky, solid, and adorable car!  I owned a high end Cadillac, and longed for a reason to move to Suzuki.   Even bought an extended warranty, and plan to drive this equisite and personable charmer as long as it's willing to go . . .It sucks up everything on the highway, and also slides easily into tight city parking.  Heartily recommend!!"
suzuki,aerio,2005,Steve, 02/22/2005,A Car That Really CAN!,5,"This is about the new, very improved 2005 Aerio AWD wagon, whch stashes an amazing amout of cargo, and still allows plenty of room for people and pets.  I've known of the Aerio wagon for several years, and have driven it on occasion in various parts of the country, always with admiration.  However, the elegant and sophisticated interior upgrades prove that an already great car can become greater!  The 6 CD sound system, with 7 speakersand woofer provide concert hall acoustics along with steering wheel adjustments.  And the headroom for tall people is miles beyond the norm.  Nothing really compares with this Aerio wagon, with its AWD --which is usually only found in more expensive vehicles

What this car offers under $20,000 is so exceptional that it's hard to imagine what else Suzuki could further provide that would enhance the integrity of this vehicle anyfurther.  It's a great driving machine, with plenty of heart!"
suzuki,aerio,2005,Mike Lapietra, 03/23/2005,love it !,4,"I bought this car in the dead of the Canadian winter and had to commute many days through snow, ice and slush.  With the ABS, AWD and heated mirrors this is a great car if you live in Canada. It is a lot of fun to drive and it is loaded. It looks small, but there is lots of space inside for the passengers and when you fold the back seat you really have a good station wagon. Also, the driver's seat can be pumped up very high, so you will have great visibility. So far I am really happy with it and the Suzuki dealership I bought it from offers outstanding customer service."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Kyle B, 04/02/2005,Killa Deal,5,"I had a Grand Vitara and wanted to look for another that was automatic.  When I saw the SX it immediatley started to grow on me.  I paid 15,500 loaded including ABS and climate control.  For the money you can't beat it.  It is fun to drive, easy to operate, and the car does turn heads.  A warranty that takes the pain out of ownership is also a big plus.  I love the way that it handles and it is very peppy while still maintaining good mileage.  If you are looking to have a great little road rocket without emptying your pocket this is a great choice."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Tony, 04/07/2005,Overlooked Treasure,4,"This is one great little car. It has room in back and space is flexible between cargo/luggage with the fold-flat seat. Front seat comfort is outstanding for the class, and the performance for the money is in a class by itself. It's the little touches that make it so very nice, like dampening on the sunglass holder.The interior is very upscale for the price, except for the carpets underfoot in the cargo area. Comfortable seats, and the switching has a high quality feel.I use this as my daily driver, and I consider myself fairly critical of cars - my other car of comparison is a Porsche. Again, I repeat - this is one great little car."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Bkent, 06/09/2005,Great little car,3,My only complaint about the car so far is it's handling and turning ability at high speeds.
suzuki,aerio,2005,bonnie, 07/05/2005,Love this big little car,5,"After driving my saturn for 4 years, I went to purchase another small vehicle due to my long working commute. But, I live in Pa and the weather can be harsh at times...this car got me through the mountains, the horror of driving the highway with all the 18wheelers!!  This car is fun, turns the heads of drivers on the highway..and I feel totally safe inside"
suzuki,aerio,2005,christian, 07/13/2005,The best thing,4,This is the best thing that's happened to me. the aerio is the best hatchback compared to the matrix (XR)and the mazda 3
suzuki,aerio,2005,Terry in KC, 08/25/2005,Most AWD bang for the buck.,4,"Looked for second car for wife to complement her Lexus LS400. AWD was a must for KC winter commutes. We looked at just about everything under $20-22K, and kept coming back to this thing. It provides the best combo of power, equipment, warranty, interior, ride, etc near it's price point. Better ride, gas mileage than small SUV's, plus quieter & cheaper. Interior style nice, exterior different but we like it. Build quality not Lexus, but neither is price. Very peppy, amazingly little wind noise at 80 mph. Handling won't wow anyone, but not a big factor for us. Resale poor, but should improve with increasing popularity. Biggest complaints: really lousy OEM tires. Spark plugs may be too hot for moderate or warm climates."
suzuki,aerio,2005,burt weiss, 12/07/2005,I enjoy my little wagon,4,"Picked Aerio SX after much hands on comparison with Pontiac Vibe and Toyota Matrix.  The Aerio has much more equipment, is much peppier up hills, and costs about $3,000 less. It might depreciate faster than the Toyota, but I plan to keep car until the end of its warranty, at least seven years.  What I like most about the car is how it is so easy to get in and out of.  You don't sit down in this car, you sit up - just slide right in and buckle up. It has lots of foot room and lots of headroom in the back.  Does this height compromise cornering? As I do not do high speed chases through town, I haven't noticed. There is an occasional creak coming from somewhere that I could do without.  Also, I would have liked 16"" wheels. This car has a great stereo.  I can tune in out of town ball games. "
suzuki,aerio,2005,Josh P, 05/02/2006,"1 year, 24k miles and Still LOVE IT!",4,"I purchased my Aerio SX one year ago this month after a ton of researching and comparison shopping.  I have been nothing but satisfied with this car!  I absolutely love driving it.  My wife and I have to take turns driving it to work every other week, even after having it for a year now.  It is roomy enough for my family of 4 in the passenger area, and has plenty of room for a couple of weeks worth of groceries, or the dog crate in the back.  I have been nothing but pleased with this fast and fun little car.  This was my first ever import car, and I plan on buying another Suzuki.  You can't beat the price when it comes to warranty and features.  I would say go for it!  You won't be disappointed!"
suzuki,aerio,2005,dhenderson, 05/14/2006,Exellent Car,4,"My husband and I have owned two Aerios.  The first we bought used, and bought the second when we traded in the used Aerio because we wanted some of the updated features it had.  The Aerio has been nothing but reliable.  It had great acceleration and is agile and superbly handles city and highway traffic.  It's easy to back out and park like a small car but has almost the interior space of a touring sedan.  It's more attractive than much of its competition and offers a comparable or better engine to boot. "
suzuki,aerio,2005,mesx, 07/14/2006,What a mistake!,2,"I bought my Aerio brand new, a year ago and have done nothing but repair this piece of junk since.  Its front sway bar bushings came out of the mounting brackets four times, I have replaced six tires because they kept being destroyed by a mechenical defect, I've had had three alignments done (the dealer took it to a body shop last time, maybe they had to straighten the frame), the power door locks failed, I had the front lower control arm bolts almost fall out, had styrofoam fall off the rear bumper (under painted plastic cover), and the heat shield for the exhaust manifold and the hood were lose and rattling the day I drove it off the lot. This was my first new car and it has given me more problems than my last five used Hondas combined."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Jake, 10/10/2006,Very Pleased,4,"I love the roomy interior.  The 155 horsepower engine helps when merging into fast highway traffic.  I got a lot of standard features that are optional with other small cars.  The warranty is great, too.  I don't understand why it doesn't sell better."
suzuki,aerio,2005,SXer, 11/01/2006,Quick Ride,4,I have had my Aerio SX Wagon for a year now and it is great. It handles well and looks good. I searched for a good car with good horsepower and came across the Aerio. It's 2.3 DHOC engine is great. I wanted to get another one but Suzuki does not make them anymore. I will have to settle for the Sedan. This car can do more if it had more performance parts.
suzuki,aerio,2005,suzuki convert, 11/29/2006,Very Suprised and Impressed,4,"I picked up this Aerio SX as sort of a joke, coming out of a 2004 Honda Accord Coupe with a 6-speed manual transmission and a 240 hp V6 engine. It was cheap and I thought that I would have it for a month and get rid of it.  Well, almost seven months later I still have it and for some reason I really enjoy driving it. It does not have very good handling or impressive pick up, but the shifter is a joy to use, it's extremely comfortable, and I am impressed with the features. So give it a try, you'll be impressed."
suzuki,aerio,2005,aggirl, 04/14/2007,Lots of Up Keep,3,"My car eats my tires. 6 new tires in 2 years!  I have to rotate them about every 2,000 miles or they will shred in no time.  I have had to replace the brakes twice, both after only 8-10,000 miles, last time I paid up and replaced them outside of the dealership for big money and that seems to be helping.  It feels unreliable, I won't drive it long distances as I don't trust my tires on road trips.  Needed a new belt at 15, 000 miles and the paint chips off super easy.  I would love to love this car because it is so super comfy, tons of room and easy to drive, but it has drained my wallet, it takes more to keep it running than it's worth.  Perhaps I got lemon."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Tim, 04/24/2007,2005 suzuki Aerio Sx. Not a happy camper,2,"I can honestly say I felt the same way most of the other reviewers felt on this site about there Aerios when I first purchased the car however 36,000 miles later and its a much different feeling. My Aerio has went through 3 sets of tires which were rotated at 5,000 mile intervals. The front sway bar bushings have been replaced.One week later the squeaking is back. More squeaks in the dash. Paint is not very good. Easy to scratch when opening the doors .They do buff out but the chips on the hood do not. I am very disappointed in the car.I thought it would hold up better.The suspension is terrible on this car.Too many squeaks and rattles .I guess you get what you pay for. Not Recommended"
suzuki,aerio,2005,Ava Todd, 03/06/2008,Many repair issues,2,"I like the look of my car but the amount of times I have had to have it repaired (many times for the wheel bearings) and number of tires and other mechanical problems I would not recommend it to anyone. I have been a proud owner of 3 Suzukis before this one. I will not recommend anyone to buy these anymore. This has been a nightmare, including the Suzuki repair service causing more problems also. I am also only getting 17 miles to the gallon and my cruise control doesn't work either."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Bonzar, 09/02/2009,"ENIGNE, TRANSMISSION & PAINT",2,"This car is junk. At less than 100,000km the paint began to chip, the muffler and exhaust rotted completely, went through 2 sets of tires, and im pretty sure my rotars are long overdue. At 105,000km, I had the engine replaced because of a manufacturers defect. A Piston rod snapped firing the remaining pieces through my block, into the oil pan. At 120,000km, My transmission goes (M.T.). My synchros is finished causing severe grinding when decelerating during a downshift. The stock battery is terrible. I left my stereo on for 10 minutes while the car was off. DEAD. My airbag light came on at 85,000km. The road noise is terrible, the electrical motors in the windows are failing. enuf said? "
suzuki,aerio,2005,suz21, 11/03/2014,Great Car!,4,"Bought this car new. In the first two years, the brakes needing changing out a couple of times, & I am not a heavy brake user--but once I had ceramic brakes installed, no more problems.  Apart from that, I've had zero problems with it for the most part. Very reliable. I am at 80,000 miles and it runs like a dream. Only complaint I have at this point is living in Pacific Northwest & wet winters causes my car to slide about on slick roads if I have to stop too fast. It doesn't have a lot of road traction, and I've been told due its light weight. The tires are good winter tires, and I've only had to replace them two times. "
suzuki,aerio,2005,AL, 08/29/2005,Good Bang for Your Buck,5,"Overall, this car is excellent for its price. It sure has power and can haul some butt on the road. At first, you may not expect it to be too great for being a new car on the market, but try it and you'll end up liking it."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Kim, 04/24/2006,Lucky Lady,5,"I named my Aerio ""Lucky Lady.""  It's been months and I'm still crazy about driving it. I'm a regional store manager, and drive little winding mountain roads every day. I upgraded the factory tires with Yokohama TRZ and have had no problem getting to my distant store in snow or ice. I never miss work!  My passengers are always amazed by the comfort and roominess of the interior. My boss loves my trunk space.  He is always loading me down with cases of drinks. Anyone ever heard of Old Fort Mountain in NC? My Lucky Lady loaded with drinks, can do 60+ over it and I pass everyone.  Its great gas mileage is a bonus in times like this."
suzuki,aerio,2005,miliboi84, 09/03/2005,Best Little Car Around,5,"Great Car, it gives you everything you need with only a few drawbacks.  Besides the cheap interior plastics, it is great.  Room in the front and back seats are good, storage is great, performance is good, and finally it is fun to drive."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Lynn, 01/17/2006,Will Buy Another One...,4,"We bought this Suzuki Aerio for our college daughter who was not happy as she had been driving a Audi A4 quattro. We also have an A6 quattro. The Audis have been unreliable and expensive.  We will never buy one again!   We were happily surprised to find an affordable AWD car to replace our daughter's A4. I only drove in the car when we first purchased it, from CT to FL. It has a super ride! It's roomy, comfy, and has nice dash controls w/great placement!  The cloth seats are awesome!  Our daughter thinks it is ""cheap"", but she was spoiled driving an Audi. She says that the AWD doesn't feel like it works, so I recommend you test drive the AWD in rain/snow if possible as I can't confirm daughter's complaint. I do know that I want my own Aerio."
suzuki,aerio,2005,slsawyer, 01/31/2006,Affordable Fun Car!,4,"The Suzuki Aerio wasn't my first choice, but it was definitely the right choice!  It has a roomy interior and lots of head room.  It is great for going uphill with overdrive off.  I am still breaking in the gas mileage rate.  The first comments from everyone who sees it is ""Cute!""  So far it has been very reliable.  I put it in the league with Honda/Toyota, only affordable.  The interior seat fabric could be upgraded though. Also, the sway bar and passenger mirror had to be replaced right away, but that has been the only problem.  I love this car!"
suzuki,aerio,2005,Jose Hernandez, 03/13/2007,Tire Eating Machine,3,"This car has eaten three sets of tires in 70,000 miles.  Something is wrong with the rear end.  The dealer says that nothing is wrong, yet it eats tires.  I'm on my 4th set of tires, good tires Michelen's Symmetri. It also has worn out Goodyears and two sets of Bridgestones."
suzuki,aerio,2005,Joe, 03/29/2007,Megamega Tire Eater,3,Our car eats tires. We also lost our AWD. Our dealer has fixed the viscous coupler joint and aligned the tires. We still have a serious vibration at 55 mph and above. Our current tires are wearing fast.
suzuki,aerio,2006,UW2012, 04/27/2010,Bring Back The Aerio,4,"My Aerio has been a great car, bought it new, only 5 miles on it. Some initial buzzing in door panels, but dealership fixed that right away, just tightned some nuts. Gas MPG's started out low but kept improving with more miles. Now gets 25 city if I drive reasonably and as high as 41.5 mpg hwy with avg hwy mpg's around 33 mpg. Storage capacity is outstanding, specially with the back seats down. Only 1 warranty claim so far, the water pump bearing, and the dealership treated me like royalty, free loaner car and fantastic attitude. I constantly get compliments on the looks of the car interior. Has it's minor quirks just as all cars do but none of them are serious. I recommend it to anyone!"
suzuki,aerio,2006,jason132, 04/24/2013,Amazing Vehicle!,5,"I bought this car new and now have over 290,000 KMs (180,000 miles) today. You did not read that wrong! I have never had a problem with the engine or transmission.

To put this in further perspective, I live in the coldest city in the world, Winnipeg MB. 

This car has been an absolute blast to drive!
It still handles beautifully and still has as much power today as the day I drove it off the lot. With routine maintenance I don't think this car will ever die.

I would recommend this car to everyone!"
suzuki,aerio,2006,ladyshoes, 02/04/2011,What an Amazing Car!,4,"I've owned my Suzuki Aerio SX for 5 years and have over 80k miles.
In that time I've driven it through ice/snow storms, high heat and across country twice.
This little car hasn't given me ANY problems whatsoever.
In fact, except for fluid changes (and irregular ones at that), 2 new sets of tires and new brakes at 75k miles, I've had no problems.
Body still looks brand new, although the bumpers are a little flimsy and may crack if you hit something high.
Interior is very high quality, especially compared with the cheap stuff in cars today.
After over 80,000 miles it's still running like the day I bought it and body is still solid.
Impressive for an inexpensive car that I've driven hard"
suzuki,aerio,2006,nevadaboy, 06/22/2010,Good Car,3,"It's a good car. Although, when we went on vacation and unplugged the battery cable and came back and plugged it back in, the stereo was locked. Now we can't use the stereo - it's locked forever!"
suzuki,aerio,2006,Alan, 03/24/2010,"Aerio Wagon, great used car",4,"I was researching many different cars and trucks focusing on Ford Rangers, which I like a lot, Corolla's, and the Matrix Wagon.  As soon as I drove the Suzuki Aerio around the block I was sold.  The car had 45,000 miles on it but ran silky smooth, has good acceleration and go cart like handling. I will definitely consider buying another new one.  Suzuki has made a believer out of me.  Like another reviewer here I am 6'3"" and this car has more head room and open space inside than my Subaru, or Rav, which are both great cars as well, it's just the Aerio is the best handling sporty drive of the three and shifts gears so smoothly I rarely feel it.  The sound system also rocks."
suzuki,aerio,2006,sal96, 06/05/2014,Does it get any better?,5,"I bought my Aerio with 130k, and I couldn't be happier.
The Four cylinder, is quiet, built well and doesn't lag. As with typical small japanese cars, required service is minimal, changing your oil, ATF (very important), brakes every 20k. When it comes time to do service like timing belt and alternator, it is still easier to do than many other vehicles. Headroom inside is very good"
suzuki,aerio,2006,Jet, 03/16/2006,diamond in the rough,4,"I bought my 2006 Aerio SX premium package based on my roomates expirience with his 2004 SX AWD. I think it's the best car for the money. Its warranty has no deductable and is FULLY transferable, not just to a family memeber like the Korean brands. The only negative about the car is buzzing door panels on rough roads. Talk to your dealer, they will fix for free like mine did. If you can find any of these cars left, then snatch it up because they are no longer making them. A new car is coming out but it won't be an Aerio.  Hurry before they are all gone!"
suzuki,aerio,2006,drdud, 03/02/2009,Not Bad but has a couple of problems,4,"20 mpg around town 25 mpg on the highway , mystery rattle in the center of the dash in cold weather ? Moans like my old 48 Chrysler when going over a hump .stock tires stink 2 of 4 are square ! All in all its a nice little care & got a great deal."
suzuki,aerio,2006,Frank, 12/03/2010,Tough car,4,I liked the room and AWD.  Car does great in all conditions.  Milage OK avg. 27plus MPG commute.  When there is no traffic 30 MPG at 65 to 70 MPH. Stero system terrible in the PA mountains.  Only complaint is that it goes through factory front pads every 12k.  Goes 30k with after market pads. I have over 175000 miles on the car and it shows no signs of giving up.
suzuki,aerio,2006,driver, 09/23/2005,Love It!,5,"So far, this car has been great.  We average 30 mpg.  We are older, and very tall people and find the comfort and convenience all that we can ask for in this inexpensive car."
suzuki,aerio,2006,Suzuki convert, 11/16/2005,Suzuki Convert,4,"I only bought my 2006 Suzuki Aerio because the 2006 Honda Civic was out of my league.  It turns out that this was very fortunate for me.  It's big, comfortable, and has lots of zoom.  This is a fun car and it is loads cheaper than Hondas!"
suzuki,aerio,2006,Bandguy, 09/13/2009,Could have been better,3,"While it is fun to drive, the sound system needs upgrade in speaker placement and sound quality. The cup holders in the front only hold a 12 oz can securely. Anything else will spill all over when accelerating or braking.  The seats are comfortable even over long distances.  I'm very disappointed with the gas mileage.  I'm getting only 22 mpg.  A little car like this should get more like 30 mpg. Perhaps a larger fuel tank so it will go farther.  The new Camaro gets better mileage.  Cargo area is excellent and the area under the floor is very convenient."
suzuki,aerio,2006,Karen V., 09/23/2009,Love My Car,4,"This car is a blast to drive.  I have doubled my driving distance since buying this car because it is so much fun to drive.  I find I drive it a little to fast but I love to drive it fast.  I'm 63 and would recommend this car to any age.  Such a shame they didn't do  better advertising on this car, it would have out sold a lot of other cars if it had gotten more air time.  The only car I have ever owned that I loved as much as this one was my 1961 Red Austin Healy.  My SX is red not as fast as fast as the Austin Healy but just as much fun to drive!"
suzuki,aerio,2006,katie, 05/09/2006,Good car,5,"I like my little Suzuki Aerio. I get 30 mpg on Florida highways where we drive 75 mph. I like the way it handles. It's got excellent pick up for a 4 cylinder. The radio controls on the steering wheel are very handy. I also like the a/c and heat controls. For a small car, the seats are quite comfortable."
suzuki,aerio,2006,Adam H, 05/24/2006,I love this car,4,"We were shopping for a fuel efficient car that had good safty ratings, warraty and an affordable price.  We bought the all wheel drive automatic version of the Aerio.  It drives great.  It's not as peppy as the 03' Mustang we traded in but it's a lot of fun to drive.  The best feature of this car is the roominess inside.  It's very deceiving!"
suzuki,aerio,2006,Phil, 03/06/2006,Fourth New Car,4,"My 2006 Suzuki Aerio is my fourth new car purchase and fourteenth car purchase ever.  For a small, low-priced and economic car, the handling, power, and comfort are excellent. This line of cars will catch up to the other Japanese car-makers in a few years and will probably become like-priced. Buying now gets you a super-bargain."
suzuki,aerio,2006,drdud, 07/29/2006,"Great Deal, Great Car",4,"I traded my Subaru Legacy for this sweet ride.  It has a smooth ride, good gas milage, an attractive exterior, and a nice interior.  Plus I saved a bunch of money by buying it instead of buying a new Subaru.  Its AWD system is the same, it has a good driving position and good seat height (which is important if you have a bad back).  Its seat is higher than the ones in Subarus . This is a great little wagon."
suzuki,aerio,2006,car fan, 10/02/2006,Must Have,4,"This car is great with all the standard features you get.  The only thing I wish I had gotten is cruise control, but it's OK without it.  This car gets great gas mileage, 30 mpg on the highway.  The car is great inside and out.  I didn't really want this car. but now that I have it I love drivng it.  I took it out of town and it is a great car to travel in.  It is so comfordable and everything.  The steering is tight. "
suzuki,aerio,2006,todd, 10/04/2006,Good Overall Value,4,"The car has had numerous rattles and trim defects, but has been  otherwise reliable.  It has fabulous fuel economy, up to 40 mpg with the five speed manual transmission."
suzuki,aerio,2006,Larry, 11/12/2006,Suzuki Aerio for Fun and Economy,4,I LOVE my Aerio.  I bought it to combat $3.00/gallon gas but have discovered a new fun and exciting driving experience.  It's quicker and less expensive than the competition with more amenities.
suzuki,aerio,2006,Hazel, 01/30/2007,Enjoying the Suzuki Aerio Premium AWD,4,"The Suzuki Aerio Premium AWD is a winner. It has been navigating icy roads and hills with ease. It has good acceleration and stopping power which I consider important for safety. All of my family members love it. The trunk has a wide opening and plenty of room for an oversize stroller and lots of other items. It is getting good gas mileage, too."
suzuki,aerio,2006,m1wick, 12/01/2007,Very Satisfied,5,I loved owning the '05 vehicle so much that I purchased an '06.  I would definitely recommend this car to someone looking for a compact.
suzuki,aerio,2006,AERIOSX, 11/27/2006,Not a Happy Customer,1,"The brakes in my Aerio went out the month of Nov.  I had to wait one week to get this fixed I had to rent a vehicle to drive. I am not a happy customer. I do not like this car. I have spent more more on repairs in six months than I did on a used vehicle in a year.  This was suppose to be economical for me, so far I have spent over $1,000.  I still need to get an oil change again.  I drive a lot. I need my car to get to my grandson. This is not a good vehicle for me.  It is not acceptable that dealers do not keep parts in stock when they know no one else can get these part for a year before they release the correct specification."
suzuki,aerio,2006,shankus74, 11/17/2013,Good car till you need a repair!!!!!,3,"Beside changing tires and brakes the other repairs are laborious!!!
Try to replace a ball joint, all the bolts are rusted and you need to replace them all!a job of 30 min takes 4 hours in labor. wait and youll see those major flaws!!"
suzuki,aerio,2006,zeabry, 08/18/2008,I Love My Aerio!,5,"I love my Aerio. It is first car I have owned and I would not trade it for the world. We love Suzuki's and have the Aerio and XL-7. I would recommend this car to anyone. I has great power, great amount of head and leg room, and is just an all around great car.  t is a joy to drive."
suzuki,aerio,2006,Motorhead73, 04/27/2009,A VIC to an AERIO,5,"I LOVE the AERIO. The couch in a boat(crown Vic) was scary driving on wet roads and the weight was great for coasting. The security the Aerio has provided is the biggest seller for me. It hugs the road and grabs the corners without any sway. The control of the front end with the Aerio sets the ice fear to the back burner. The power on the 2 uphill climbs over looking  a steep cliff makes me feel !!!! The seat wraps around you like a race car seat for secure fit in a drive of great head and arm room with two people in the front, I the larger lovebug and I do NOT feel crunched in any way. Like sitting in a chair, sliding across the seat for entry (not a drop to the floor) "
suzuki,aerio,2006,Altoid43, 06/01/2009,"""Git n Go""",5,"I have had my Aerio SX for three years and have had no problems whatsoever yet. She runs just like the bikes. At 90 mph runs smooth as silk. Can run with the big boys, and the gas mileage is very good. I love this gal."
suzuki,aerio,2006,David, 01/21/2010,Well Satisfied,4,"Purchased used 06 in Jan 2010 with 48,000 miles. Very pleased with 31 MPG. Seats are comfortable and supportive which I believe the tall cabin and upright seating contribute too. Mine is the basic model so no cruise. Wish Suzuki had cut cost on the Auto climate control system and made cruise standard. Also wish the intermittent wpers had more variation.  One speed intermittent wipers just doesnt cut it in the Northwest. Clutch is smooth and positive. Impressed with fit and finished of interior except for the carpet which is a bit thin. Large trunk area is nice and fold down seat add to the space but body structure intrudes making the opening behind the seat somewhat constricted."
suzuki,aerio,2006,N. Smith, 02/01/2010,"Decent car, great value",3," I purchased my Suzuki Aerio new for just over $15k. I drove it until the fall of 2008 when I went to a Nissan Frontier. I put almost 50k catastrophe-free miles on it, and believe I got more than my money's worth.  Though not as refined or well-designed as it's competition, the Aerio is a terrific value and, at least in my case, a reliable, versatile vehicle. If you can deal with it's quirks, and don't mind a rough ride, it's definitely worth a look.  I don't regret going to a pickup, but I do miss the fuel economy of the Aerio. My mother has the car now, and has been using for over a year with no issues; the AWD is a great safety feature, and a real plus here in snowy N"
suzuki,aerio,2006,John, 10/21/2005,Way to go Suzuki!,4,"This is a big car in a little package! It is fun, safe, and very roomy.  The Aerio is very practical, especially if you have pets or children."
suzuki,aerio,2006,Patrick, 12/31/2005,Great Car,4,"I had a couple of TSBs to take care of on my Suzuki Aerio, but since then the car has been great!  I am getting better than the rated mpg and I love the amount of room it has for such a small car.  The interior is a little weak or ""cheap,"" but the rest of the car seems great."
suzuki,aerio,2006,RJL, 01/04/2006,My First New Car,4,I just bought a 2006 Suzuki Aerio Premium and I love it! It's so easy to handle. It's a perfect little car to keep me on the go.
suzuki,aerio,2006,mrmmac, 04/06/2006,My New Aerio,4,I purchased this car three months ago and am still very happy with it.  The only problem is the driver side does not have enough leg room.
suzuki,aerio,2006,Jim Gunning, 06/05/2006,Very good,4,The Suzuki Aerio is a very good small car.  It gets 27 mpg average on highways and 24 mpg city.
suzuki,aerio,2006,kmw, 06/18/2006,Love my Red Zuki,5,The Aerio is a great car to drive. I have had it for almost a year with no problems. It is a cute commuter car with a suprising amount of room. I have loaded everything into it including my new range in the box. I traded my big SUV for this car and love it.
suzuki,aerio,2006,MyWife'sNewCar, 06/17/2006,Best Choice,5,"I really like this car.  I happily recommend it to any one considering a new small car purchase.  It beats the competition hands down on content and features.  The little car is a pleasure to drive, now I don't mind Walmart parking lots.  Give it a try I'm sure you'll be suprised."
suzuki,aerio,2006,Kevim , 10/15/2005,Lots of Fun for the Price!,5,"I'm tall, 6' 4"" and commute 120 miles per day. My Suzuki Aerio is very roomy for its size. This was not my first choice, but it was the right choice. It is powerful, roomy and just plain fun to drive. It could use a little more power (for the canyon), but otherwise it is a great buy. With the options for the price, you can't go wrong.  Plus it comes with a 100,000 mile warranty.  I haven;t had any problems with mine so far."
suzuki,aerio,2006,vasu m, 12/02/2005,Great value for the money,4,"Everything in my Suzuki Aerio seem to be of good quality for a vehicle in this price range, including the audio. The dash plastics seem to have been upgraded in the 2006 model to be semi-soft.  The tires pick up a bit of road noise - probably replacements will help. It is a bit narrow compared to its peers (especially the MINI Cooper and Scion Xa) and the track is actually less than the width. Thus the Scion and Cooper exhibit a bit less roll and slightly better handling, but the engine and wealth of features make the Aerio a much better choice in its class."
suzuki,aerio,2006,MO, 03/02/2006,Fun Car,4,"I just love the fact that the Suzuki Aerio is so roomy and comfortable, but still handles like it's a sportscar.  I have tons of room for road trips with friends, trips to the grocery store or just moving one large object with the fold down seats. Being a tall person, I have plenty of head and leg room without stealing it from the others in the car.  This is a must look at if you love to travel or just like looking good wherever you go."
suzuki,aerio,2006,brotherburce, 03/08/2006,Aerio-DYNAMIC,4,"From the shiny exterior to the upgraded interior features, the Suzuki Aerio offers much more than its class competition.  It comes with electric windows, door locks, mirrors, keyless remote entry, side airbags, a visually catchy instrument panel, and great CD/MP3 6 speaker sound system with steering wheel controls to start things off.  Add an impressive 2.3 litre power plant with a responsive automatic transmission for quick highway response.  As a tall person, I appreciate the high seating position that aids in visibility and easy access. Its steering is responsive and the suspension gives you a bigger feel than the car actually is. the Aerio has a unique design in the parking lot and on the freeway, I like Aerio's stingy attitude toward gas."
suzuki,aerio,2006,nicole, 04/13/2006,I love my Aerio,4,"This car is much quicker and agile than I had expected. The interior is great and very easy to keep clean. Overall I think it was a very good value. My best friend has a VW Golf and she paid almost $5,000 more and the only thing she has that I don't is a nifty switchblade key."
suzuki,aerio,2006,wayne morgan, 05/15/2006,Thumbs Up for the Aerio SX,4,"I have put 5,500 miles on my Aerio SX so far and everything is working great.  I like the room that it has for a car of its size and the way its gets around in traffic."
suzuki,aerio,2006,Robin, 05/12/2006,Dirt Road Commuter,3,I almost bought a Subaru RS instead of my Suzuki Aerio.  I'm glad that I didn't.  I saved a bucket of cash and now own the best mountain dirt road long distance commuter I've ever had. I am still in the honeymoon stage though.  Give me some time to be more objective.
suzuki,aerio,2006,TR528, 06/22/2006,Love It So far,4,"I am surprised at how well the Aerio rides. The 2.3L engine provides plenty of power. The car seems very tight, it has a good solid sound when you close the door.  It has plenty of room. "
suzuki,aerio,2006,Theresa, 06/28/2006,My new Suzuki,4,"I went from an SUV to the Aerio and am in love with it, especially with the gas milage! It has great pickup plus it is easy and fun to drive. It's only been just under a month that I have been driving this car and so far so good."
suzuki,aerio,2006,charles simpkins, 07/14/2006,Love My Sucuki,4,"Since my wife and I purchased our Aerio we have fallen in love with it. We have owed Hondas, Nissans, and Toyotas and now our Suzuki. It has been the best car that we have ever owned in terms of reliability and performance."
suzuki,aerio,2006,Crs1122, 08/02/2006,2006 Aerio SX AWD,4,"My Aerio's gas mileage started out low at about 20 mpg highway, but after 3,000 miles it's up to 25 mpg. So far this car has been very dependable! I receive compliments on its comfort and style from lots of people. "
suzuki,aerio,2006,Liz Marshall, 08/26/2006,Great Car,4,"The Suzuki Aerio is the best AWD deal out there.  I am looking at a safer commute with a small price tag.  I love the roomy interior, it handles well, it is great looking, and it's a good value.  I love this car!"
suzuki,aerio,2006,Tazdiablo, 09/07/2006,My Wife's New Car,5,"I bought this little car for my wife.  She like the color and and the interior creature comforts.  I am 6' 4"" and have not missed many meals, but I can still get in with hardly any problems.  The cabin is roomy even with my wife, two kids, and myself in the car there is plenty of room.  The car has the power to do what we need and still gets great fuel economy.  For a guy who loves the big cars I am really impressed with this little car.  Driving it is fun, just ask my wife.  She herself is tall and she is extremely comfortable in it and loves the stereo and steering wheel controls.  Neither of us would be shy about recommending one of these little cars to our friends or family."
suzuki,aerio,2006,kspage, 09/07/2006,Best Little Wagon for Moms,5,"I love this car!  When I was shopping for a new car that was sporty but also practical for me and my toddler, I never even knew about this car. But after my Mom took me to a Suzuki dealership, which was unusual because I am a Honda lover, I immediately fell in love with the look of the Aerio. Because I am in my 20's, I didn't want a minivan but also didn't want to revisit my teenie bopper days. It's a hip car with a mature feel."
suzuki,aerio,2006,FJG, 03/07/2007,Value with Extras and Power,4,"This was my first Suzuki purchase and it was a good choice. The car has ample room, comfort and offers good performance. Its 155 horsepower delivers over 30 mpg in combined city/hwy driving. I have owned it for six months and had zero issues. "
suzuki,aerio,2006,Gary, 06/05/2007,Great Car,5,"We are now on our 4th Suzuki. We love them, they are fun to drive and very reliable. 29 miles to the gallon isn't too shabby either. You get your moneys worth and more. I wish they would come out with a truck."
suzuki,aerio,2006,Joshua, 09/04/2007,Best car i have driven,5,This is a great car and is fun to drive. The doors and dashboard on my 2006 Aerio SX do not rattle. The car has great gas mileage and this is a great car to buy and comes with a lot of standerd features.

suzuki,aerio,2007,n/a, 02/24/2007,Beat Car I have Ever Owned,4,"I was impressed with how roomy the inside of this car is. I am close to six feet tall and it has plenty of head and leg room! Also, I love its unique looks. It preforms great, though it does not do well on ice as it is a very light weight car.  All in all, it is the best car that I have ever owned."
suzuki,aerio,2007,Jacj, 05/04/2007,Great Car,4,"So far this has been a great car.  The engine has more than enough power for climbing hills, and still gets about 29 miles to the gallon.  I would have liked the arm rest to be a little longer as it does not come out far enough for me.  Overall great car."

suzuki,equator,2009,R.Norman, 12/31/2009,Go big or stay Nissan,4,"Good warranty, okay fuel mileage,and a comfortable ride.  After buying my truck, I later returned to the dealer, and was unable to order parts,such as a bush guard, mouldings, etc. The Equator appeared to be there pink elephant, opposed to other Suzuki products on hand. The parts department had no answers, however I found every thing I needed at Nissan. When time for servicing the dealer had to back order a oil filter.  I reside in British Columbia, and have only seen one or two Equators in passing over the last 6 months.  In western Canada, Suzuki needs to go big or leave this truck to Nissan. My truck gets a lot of looks, along with questions. Obviously due to poor advertising."
suzuki,equator,2009,Moose, 05/16/2009,Brand new owner,4,"Well, I have been hunting for a new vehicle & stumbled upon this new Suzuki Equator!  Looks great, but I'll admit I hadn't done any research on it.  Dealer said it was basically a Nissan Frontier, but looks better to me! I just bought mine last night & will come back here after I have some experience with it."
suzuki,equator,2009,Family, 11/06/2009,This truck is not safe for your family,2,We bought this truck hoping for better fuel mpg & better performance.  We loved the truck when we first bought but in Aug 2009 we were on vac. the brakes went all the way to the floor & are very mushy. We are still dealing with this issue & no one wants to help us. The Suzuki rep. states everything is fine but two other certified brake tech states that there is a problem.  So we have a truck that we can not drive because it is not safe for our family!!!!!
suzuki,equator,2009,Roger, 08/08/2009,Premium Ride,4,"I have owned my new Equator 2 weeks now. With the big 16 inch tires and aloy wheels, it rides like a big ruck.So far combind mpg is 20. Things they could improve on are: Should have offered the V-6 in the ""premium. Plastic flimsy glove box and door. Gas door is not remote and can be opened by anyone on the outside. No trip computer unless you buy the ""sport model. Dash lights illumination level is fixed and cannot be changed. Auto/manual shift is nice feature. Mud guards; bed liner and other items all extras also. This truck in the premium package should offer more as standard features especially for the price of this model. Needs improvement if Suzuki stays in the truck business."
suzuki,equator,2009,Mr.G, 09/15/2009,In the NYC area Nissan only offers 4.0 L,5,"After considering the Frontier first, during the cash for clunkers period, I learned that Suzuki offers the same vehicle with 2.5L engine, I traded a v8 engine 5.0L/4X4. I wanted a engine, cut in half, to improve the mileage (10mpg), instead, the only engine offer in the neighboring area of 8 Nissan dealers was 4.0L. The vehicle's 1st trip was  to my getaway cabin in the Catskill area. It took some learning to deal with transmission on long hill climbs, but it handled well, I brought a 1/2"" rubber mat, preferred over the spray on mat and hitch attachment to chassis was simple to install with 6 bolts on chassis, all the wiring connection are right there by the bumper area, simple! Great Truck."
suzuki,equator,2009,Mike V, 09/29/2009,Diamond in the Rough,4,"I needed a newer truck with better gas mileage and Suzuki delivered. Suprised to find the price was $2000.00 less than the Nissian Frontier. I have been driving Equator for 3 months / 3000 miles and averageing 20mpg around town. The automatic transmission does take a bit of getting use to, maybe due to the 2.5l engine. I added spray on liner and a trifold cover.

I'm 6,3 and their is plenty of room for me. I would suggest to anyone to take a hard look at the Suzuki equator."

suzuki,equator,2009,James, 07/04/2009,Solid Truck,4,"I recently just replaced my totalled 2009 Toyota Tacoma with a 2009 Suzuki Equator.  I could not pass up the incredible rebates and the fact that the Equator is essentially a Nissan Frontier.  My only complaint with the truck is that the 5th gear is too low which leads to higher cruising RPMs.  I assume the Equator would get the same mileage as the Tacoma if it had a higher 5th gear.  Overall, excellent truck.  Well worth the purchase price!  Also, get a sprayed-on bed liner...looks great with this addition."

I can't tell you how many people that have stopped to talk to me about my truck.  All of them were amazed that Suzuki is offering a pick-up truck.  When I show them some of the features it comes with the factory (factory bed-liner, a utili-track tie down system, a Garmin navigation system, bed-extender, and the passenger seat folds down) they are simply impressed with the value.  Now, I have driven this vehicle for approximately 5 months with no problems and or issues. The gas mileage I am getting with pure highway driving has been a consistent 22 MPG.   "

I did serious research on this purchase as it was my first new vehicle purchase and it came down to the Equator and the Tacoma.  Toyota did not seem to care if they sold the Tacoma to me, no incentives and the frame design is really sad compared to my old Toyota. So I went with the Equator which is rugged, durable, high quality, and well thought out and executed.  Course I have only had it a few months and any new vehicle is a good thing.  Still, I am really happy with this truck which sees lots of hunting trip use.  Well done, Suzuki!"

Finally, I found a dealer that would actually work for me to find the vehicle I wanted 250 miles away!  Sales guy, was the best.  I needed an extended-cab that was 4WD.  Just not that into a 4-door pickup truck.  The truck almost rides like a car.  17"" wheels give you that extra height to get a good look down the road and the noise is low.  Plenty of reserve power, CD player sounds phenomenal, cruise control is at your right hand thumb on the steering wheel and braking is smooth.  The seats are comfortable.  Holds the corners very well.  Love the spray-on bed-liner and the tie-down rail system.  A Nissan with a Suzuki warranty.  Love it!"

At 20,000 the airconditioner started freaking out.
It would have power surges and the fan motor would go from almost off to full power on and off continuously.
Took it to the dealer multiple times, they could not fix it.
We traded the truck for a 2012 Equator, it has made it to 9325 miles and is doing the exact same thing. I am at my wits end!!!"

(It was recently totaled in a bad collision, no fault on the Suzuki and we miss it so much!) In those years we had no break-downs, excellent gas mileage, and awesome ability to bring tons of gear (the rear seats lay completely flat). The only problem we had was the outside door handles snapping some piece when it was very cold outside - it was an easy and cheap repair, but you can try to avoid it and just be very careful opening the doors when it's cold. There were no engine or any other problems. Highly recommend this car, even though it is 10 years old."

I bought this car used in 2002 but I am so glad I did.  Out side of tune-ups and( tires  every 4 years) I have had no problems with this model.  Only problem I see is when the AC or Heat is on the gas goes out the window!!!   Yet when you take this on the road for a long trip, it gives you good mileage with your gas.  No AC/heat.   I have had the maintenance was done when the times were right and the cost has not been outrages.  I do wish the seats were a bit thicker and firmer on the back to help brace your self on a long road trip.  I have to keep this car because it's the last care I'll ever buy because of my age.

I did the brakes pads once and then later on got some aftermarket drilled and slotted rotors and ceramic brake pads and new shoes and drums for the back.

In all these 13+ years the car has never broke down on the road but once it didn't start in the garage. it was just the CMP sensor and that's about a 15 minute job for this car. Replaced the Idle Control Valve once, alternator and the struts and besides the regular wear items, tires, battery, belt, It keeps on going.

My A/C never had problems since new and always blows cold."

It is peppy, reliable, gets good mpg and holds a lot of gear.  I'm glad these cars weren't ""discovered"" because it allowed us to pick one up cheap. The GLX package is packed full of features that make it comfortable and pleasant to drive. (AC, CC, moonroof, 6 CD changer, roof racks, etc.)  I think this is one of the most under-rated cars I've ever owned. "
suzuki,esteem,2000,Doug, 02/01/2016,Best used car value there is!!!,5,"This is my 2nd Esteem and a favorite of my current cars. I found my 2000 GLX wagon on craigslist for $2500.00 with only 92k miles. It has every available option and is in excellent shape. I bought the car as a spare vehicle to save miles on our much more expensive Toyota Sienna. My daily driver was a deisel VW Jetta. But after the Jetta had a mechanical problem I started driving the Suzuki. That was 9 months ago and now the Suzuki is my daily driver. I love the reliability, gas mileage and hauling capacity of this GREAT little car. I do all the work on my cars and I can tell you Suzukis were designed with a mechanics input. They are cheap and easy to service and the parts are still available. Don't let the fact that Suzuki motors is no longer in business scare you off. This has driven the prices down and that is a plus in my book. If you loved the reliability and ingenuity of the cars Honda designed back in the 80s and 90s you will love Suzuki. These are great cars and I'm going to be looking for more of them when my kids approach driving age. 
Update: Feb 2018....still have my Esteem GLX wagon. The car has 140k miles now and other than an idle control valve and alternator, the car has been trouble free. I hate to recommend one of these as a first car for a teen because new drivers tear up cars and that reduces the number of these great little cars. But my son is approaching driving age and I’ll have let him use this car (sigh).... On the plus side I loved my Esteem so much that I decided to buy another Suzuki. I now own a 2009 SX. This is now my daily driver and I love it too. All wheel drive and every option for less than $7k.  Love it. Buy a Suzuki and get these guys back in the US car market where they belong.

Had no problems until a couple months later the electical system started having problems. Radio clock wouldn't light up, and radio would turn off on me. Started idling really high, and the brakes and tires were having to be replaced often, sometimes once a month. I was buying used tires, then when I had the money bought new ones. But even with new ones, they kept leaking for some reason, so would have to put air in quite often. The rotors went bad very quickly also. Don't think the dealership did a good check but that's a gamble we all take when buying a vehicle. Think I payed way too much for it also. $12,000."

There are very few good things about this car .. it is usually average or below average. The car is very simple in design and so it is easy to work on. The build quality is bad, there are noises everywhere. A critical bolt for the engine mount snapped in the first few weeks. I think the wagon is a more practical alernative."
suzuki,esteem,2000,Cindy, 05/15/2008,Great little wagon,3,I have had my 2000 Esteem for over 5 years and have had no problems with it. I had the brakes replaced in 2005 but nothing else other than normal oil and filter changes have had to be done. I do not drive as much as most people but with over 76000 now on it I am still not finding that there is a problem.  The back seat has been able to sit three kids on a regular basis even though two of them have been adult sized or nearly so. We do not take it long distances and I am sure that would get old with everyone in it but for distances up to an hour this car does fine even with my sons who are 6' tall sitting in the back seat. Fuel economy has a large range but it gets no less than 25 MPG.

Okay, so it's not a Monte, but what do you expect? It's a little 4 banger!  Never once has it not started, and has never stalled on me.

suzuki,esteem,2001,ArkMon, 07/16/2002,Good Cute car,4,"For a subcompact car, this is a great 
one.  We specifically sought a new 
Suzuki Esteem because it was the end of 
the model year, the last year of the 
Esteem.  We figured we could strike a 
deal on one that a dealer wanted to 
move off the lot.  We ended up finding 
a great deal on a used one, instead.  
We love this car, and I think of it as 
a little Subaru.  While somewhat 
conservative, it stands out from others 
in its class.  As a small 4 cylinder, I 
expect some noise, but once up to 
cruising speed, its suprisingly smooth 
and quiet. Extra space of the wagon 
makes it feel not-so-small. I reccomend 
it to anyone searching for cars in the 
category."

By the way, my parents were so impressed with the Esteem, when they traded it in they bought another Suzuki, and have had no trouble with it either."
suzuki,esteem,2001,tony, 05/06/2008,Great value for the money,4,"This car runs very good and has been very reliable. The car came fully loaded with the aero pkg, kyb sport spsn, yokohama advan's and sportline alloys. This was a limited edition. At 67k this car runs and handles very well, I use castrol syntec 5w30 in engine and royal purple in tranny. I wash the car with meguires and wax with zymol. The color is deep space blue. I turned the front rotors 2x and replaced the pads also. I change engine oil and filter every 4k miles, since tranny does not have a filter I change tranny fluid every 15k miles, mpg highway avg 28 (advan 15"" tires) mpg city 24 avg "

This wagon is really a hidden gem in the minefield of Ford wagons and the Subaru . None of them can compare to the relibablity of the Esteem. It has the room I needed without sacrificing fuel economy. Best of all, it's subtle sportiness gets compliments from classmates at college while still being respectable at the workplace. This car has never given me any problems and from what I have heard, I don't expect any down the line either. "

suzuki,esteem,2001,Pazzion, 04/05/2002,Don't BUY THIS CAR,1,"This car was a terrible buy. Suzuki 
should have stuck with making 
motorcycles. The cars handling was 
ATROCIOUS. After 6 months, my brakes 
went out. After a mere 4 months, there 
were electrical problems; my interior 
lights would not come on. The fuses 
would go out very frequently. The 
brakes light would come on at any 
random time; I would NOT have my 
parking brake on or my foot on the 
brake pedal. Even after getting the 
brake pads replaced, it didn't feel 
like it. The car would still screech 
and make a terrible grinding noise. Had 
I done my research, I would surely have 
bought a better vehicle, even used, for 
a comparable price and MUCH better 
quality."

regarding this car, as oppose to mine. 
This car is a good way to throw out 
$10,500. ( New) or $16k  which is how 
much it has cost us to maintain. I have 
nothing positive to say regarding this 
auto. Except, I am glad we have three

Last week we were going to town and the front sub frame just rusted out and broke. Could have been very bad but we were going slow. I called American Suzuki in Ca. and they are looking into it. I hope they man up and help me get it fixed. I have owned Suzuki motorcycles all my life and this is the first car I hope to keep it a long time. So come on American Suzuki and help a guy out.

It had 60,000 miles on it.  When she graduated I bought it from her to drive to work with 90,000 miles.  I have driven it now 5 years and it has 212,000 miles.  So far there have been no major repairs required.   My husband finds it uncomfortable but I don't have any problems driving it.  It is low to the ground and tends to catch flying rocks on the windshield that a taller vehicle would have hit the grill.  It averages 30-31 MPG highway, which is the majority of my driving.  I would like cruise control.  The biggest problem has been an oil leak at the head gasket and the CD doesn't work."

1.5 years I have had NO mechanical 
failures and aside from car washes and 
oil changes this is all I have to do.  
This little car even has punch on the 
highway.  And, especially when trying 
to park in Boston or Salem the compact 
size is a must to allow fitting in 
tight spaces.  When sitting inside you 
do not even realize the compact size 
outside.  Plenty of room for 5."

I like my little car and it's great in city traffic and tight spots. I moved from Florida to Chicago and was curious to see how it would handle in ice and snow since it is very light and can be hard to handle in high winds. In snow/ice, it slides a lot in turns. The engine can be noisy but I always have the radio on, so it's not an issue for me personally. I replaced the factory CD player because mine stopped reading CDs and my intermittent windshield wipers gave out soon after purchase and now I've noticed that my wipers don't reset themselves when they turn off.

suzuki,esteem,2001,PHL Paul, 05/15/2018,My Esteem 15yrs.....,5,"I purchased my Esteem 4 cylinder Manual Transmission w cruise control.  Power windows , C.D. player and cold air. In 2003. A dealer left over. Listed at $16,500 I purchased this new car with under 5000 miles gently used demo for 12,000 dollars, ""A"" title and 100,000 mile warranty which I never used.  Brakes,  tires, oil changes,  wiper blades and gas. We're the norm. Not until about 115,000 did I have a Manual Transmission failure resulting in a total replacement.  Not to bad for a car at that time being 12 yrs old and the replacement with labor was less than 1,500 dollars.  It's sad to say goodbye but she was recently totalled and I must say withstood a major hit from the rear. SUZUKI should be proud of this defunct make and model.  She stood the test of time. If you are able to acquire one check the frame as that was the only recall item I am aware of and mine had no deterioration.  Great run. Thanks for reading.

Back seats fold flat and the cargo space held everything!  Handled very heavy (500 lbs) loads without too much complaining.  Lots of jackrabbit starts (deadlines you know) and sudden stops.  But the reliability was great.  Never even changed a headlight until 260,000 km.  Several things (rad, control arm, CV boots etc) went this week.

little pricey (but this not a ford 
Focus, so don't expect to  be readily

love it more now because that car 
saved my life. I took my eyes off the 
road for 1 second and ended up rolling 
the car over four times. Where I was 
in the driver's seat held up 
wonderfully. The passenger side, not 
so hot, but for the impact it took
(hitting a culvert in a driveway at 45

out of the car. The car is totalled,

However, city MPG is usually 20 or less, which doesn't make much sense for a car of this size/class. I've had numerous issues with the car alarm randomly sounding & the engine not turning over at all. At one point, it took over 30 attempts to turn the engine over. It was in the shop 5 times, yet the Suzuki dealer couldn't solve the problems. Go figure. The paint job is cheap & chips/scratches way too easily. Buyer beware: you can get a brand-new used Corolla for about the same price as a new Forenza. Get the Corolla, avoid the hassle."

Anything beyond something simple like an oil filter and it's back to the dealer you'll go, and you know the prices they charge.  Yup, I love the car all right, but the lack of repair parts means I'll get rid of it soon, and I won't buy one again unless that changes.  Too bad..."

This is the second one and it is as bad or worse than the first. It was replaced under warranty. The second problem is an erratic idle. Sometimes it will idle at 2,000+ RPMs at start-up or even after driving on the freeway and exiting, but I found a fix for this 98% of the time.  At 15+ MPH come to a HARD stop (no skid) and wait 3-4 seconds.  Why doe's this work? I have no clue. Otherwise I have has no problems. Also, performance tires make a HUGE improvement in the handling.

After the initial 500 miles were put on, any semblance of confidence in it was worn off.  I'll spare the details and just go on to two main points.   First, the value has dropped like a rock.  Second, anytime something needs done to this car, you better be ready to wait for the part to come in and be ready to pay through the nose for it.  I just got the brakes done - discs were $90/each and I had to wait a week.  Call your tire stores and find out how many of them stock 195/55R15 tires.  Few, if any will I'm sure.  Save some dough and frustration: buy a 5 year old Civic."

Suzuki no longer makes cars; therefore, the parts are difficult to find and most of their car dealerships are few and far between (in
other words, very few exist to service those with Suzuki cars.)

I purchased a 2004 Suzuki Forenza in 2006, and it had about 20, 000 miles on it.
It stopped working in June 2013 because it needed a new PCM ($1,230 to repair) and it had about 103,000 miles.
However, between the time that I had it and the time that it died, the car had major issues with gasket, valve, oil, trans sensor.
Also, it had at least 4 recalls on parts so be sure to do your research."
suzuki,forenza,2004,PAnthony, 10/22/2003,Check Out The Forenza,4,"This Suzuki is pretty nice. Euro styling
in and out, looks better than most of
competition. Also the good price doesn't
hurt."
suzuki,forenza,2004,EJLowerre, 05/28/2005,"Suzuki, for the price - good car",3,"Bought the car for price/gas mileage.  For 12K (tax,title,interest on loan included!) great value for the $$  Only one problem with the gas pedal being a little sticky otherwise not too bad.  did get hit by someone going about 10 mph and it ripped the bumper off but still I'm happy overall.  Gas mileage could be better with the rubber band they put in for an engine though, I get 25 around town and 30.5 on the open road which to me is not good enough."
suzuki,forenza,2004,Jewells, 12/13/2003,good car..,5,"i drove about 15 small cars before i 
got this one , it's got alot pick up 
and go.. i drove it from pa to ca and 
back last week alot fun to drive .. the 
money i save on this car WOW..i ran 
into snow and rain did real good ..i 
love the fact i could had got something 
bigger ..but i save about $3000.00 on 
this car and and got good car..and 
becuse the back sets fold down i got 
room for very thing i need to get in my 
car.. one thing i did see looking for 
cars was all about the same size but 
big name cars cost alot more, and so 
seem to small on the inside "
suzuki,forenza,2004,gbandlb, 01/13/2004,My Forenza,5,"This is an excellent vehicle. Rides

a pleasure to drive and ride in as 
well."
suzuki,forenza,2004,kinkyllama, 10/29/2005,Great car!,4,"I've had my Forenza for over 40,000 miles and I've taken it to about 20 hours of open track events plus autocrosses and she just keeps holding up! Have only had one problem which the dealer fixed.  I have no complaints, I love this car!"
suzuki,forenza,2004,Morlock, 01/22/2004,Good car-but be ware quirks!,4,"This has been a wonderful car for 
me...but not without its problems. I've 
already had to return to the dealership 
several times for emissions issues, 
alignment problems, and most recently 
fuel difficultues. Despite the fact 
that I drive primarily highway miles, 
the car stubbornly refuses to get 
anything better than 18-19 mpg--
horrendous for a vehicle of this type 
(with an engine that only puts out 
126hp)!!! I am seeking help from Suzuki 
in solving the problem because the 
dealership is stumped. The necessity of 
filling up the car after only 200 miles 
of driving is a major annoyance. "
suzuki,forenza,2004,Brianhutchins, 01/25/2004,Exceeding expectations,5,"After careful comparison shopping to 
the point of driving every car salesman 
in town crazy, I chose the Forenza LX . 
The fit & finish are better than the 
Nissan Sentra & the Honda Civic in this 
class.
The refinement of the ride and 
smoothness of the engine, along with 
lower levels of wind & road noise, made 
the choice a no-brainer. I found the 
Sentra too cramped, the Civic was too 
sparse & noisey for the $$$. Standard 
4wheel discs & steering wheel mounted 
audio controls are a big plus. Interior 
design & plastics are first rate. The 
Corolla was lighter on features for the 
price. Suzuki is well equipped to gain 
loyal repeat customers along the way."

price,real sporty. Just got and having

get it was the high financing for 66 
months of 296.00 and 100.00 down ..What 
happened to the advertized low 
payments ,this is going to turn off my 
friends who like my car, can anyone 
help on a better rate. I pay my bills."

looking to buy. After seeing many cars 
and not being to impressed, I saw the 
Forenza. I ended up buying the car that 
night. The overall design of the car 
was very appealing to the eye. All the 
standard features was a big plus. All 
the other cars were very basic and 
kinda plain inside. The price was right 
and also good gas mileage. Having great 
fun driving. My first new car in 20 
years."

suzuki,forenza,2004,rnf, 03/09/2004,unbelievable car,5,"I drove a 1990 Suzuki Swift for 14 
years and just bought a new Forenza.  
It is an amazing car.  Beautiful 
design.  Sits higher than most cars.  
I really like the S model since 
without the sunroof on the higher line 
models you get many inches of 
additional headroom.  Amazingly quiet; 
no wind noise at all.  I can't imagine 
anyone buying a Civic, etc over this 
car."
suzuki,forenza,2004,Bazman, 03/10/2004,Best test-drive yet,5,"I am still looking around, but from the 
three cars that I have test driven, 
Matrix, Elantra, and Forenza, the 
Forenza made it out ahead. I can't 
speak much for the fuel economy or 
reliability on this model personally, 
but I can say this:

Forenza is roomy, handles well, great 
interiors, very nice exteriors, and a 
great price. Listen, the toyotas are 
nice, but their sales volume is not 
giving them much to work hard or be 
nice with me. The elantra may be a 
little cheaper but the Forenza handles 
well.

I would definitely recommend buying 
this while it is costing less."
suzuki,forenza,2004,Josi, 03/11/2004,Excelent Economic Car,4,"Excelent Car for Price, nice design, 
very good futures and powered in 
manual transmission.."
suzuki,forenza,2004,Baz, 03/16/2004,Nice Car,4,"We just bought our Forenza this past 
Saturday, and we are very impressed. 
Suzuki cars are not well known in 
America, yet, but they rank up with 
Hondas and Toyotas in Pakistan. We love 
this car, and the way it is made. We 
have a 2000 infiniti G20T, and for an 
entry level model, the forenza is 
impressive. Get em before the price 
goes up, as people will soon realize 
how good of a car this truly is.

Good Luck"
suzuki,forenza,2004,d281963, 03/17/2004,Great car for the money,4,"This is an exellent car for the money 
overall but with a few obvious, easily 
corrected, cheap details.  It's ride 
and handling were superb even at higher 
speeds.  Interior was quiet and the 
ride well controlled.  Fit and finish 
were generally on-par with the class.  
Very good mid-size car at an economy 
car price, though resale value is still 
questionable.  "

thing that I dislike about the Forenza."
suzuki,forenza,2004,Tragar, 03/28/2004,Love my car,5,"I have been searching for an affordable 
vehicle for the past two months.  Most 
of the time if a car was affordable you 
would be driving a box.  The Hyundai 
Elantra made me feel claustrophobic. 
When I took the Forenza for a test 
drive I knew that it was the right 
vehicle for me.  It is roomy and classy 
at the same time with a great price 
tag.  My last vehicle was a Toyota 
Camry so you know that I already had 
high expectations."
suzuki,forenza,2004,peaceful bismillah, 04/01/2004,a lot of car for a little money,4,"Shockingly, this is a lot of car for 
$13,500. At first I was looking at the 
Verona, but I saw the Forenza in a 
brouchure. I loved its look better than 
its older brother and kept asking when 
it would be available. It just so 
happens that the first shipload came in 
the next week. So instead of buying the 
Verona, I saved a couple thousand and 
bought what I liked better. Now I'm 
eagerly waiting for aftermarket 
products to personalize my Forenza."

paid, and I'm very happy driving it!"
suzuki,forenza,2004,lawnchaircrew, 04/27/2004,Great quality for the price!,4,"This car is incredible (especially for 
being a suzuki)!  I was skeptical when 
going to test drive it but when I did 
it amazed me.  The variable power 
steering is awesome and gives you alot 
of control over the car.  Even though 
it only puts out 126 horses, it really 
wants to get up and go.  The interior 
styling is superior over its 
opponents.  Over all the egronomics of 
this car (being a suzuki) leave me 
flabbergasted!!"

vehicle and we think that it will be a 
great car.  We bought it first for its 
fuel economy.  But it has a great 
design and lots of fun colors.  He 
likes it because the manual is very 
peppy.  It also has a dash board that 
does not reflect sunlight which i think 
is one of the coolest features along 
with the cd player and the drl and the 
seatbelt in the back that does both 
cross and lap belts.  It also has one 
of the highest safety records.  I would

Forenza. I purchased this car last 
Saturday and am happy with all but one 
aspect of the car...it pulls to the 
right regardless if I'm accelerating or 
driving at a normal speed. I have made 
3 trips to the dealer since buying this 
vehicle and have been told that this 
may be NORMAL for this car by the 
service dept. There is no way it is 
normal to drive off the road! I have 
also been told that the hard pull to 
the right when I accelerate is due to 
the torque steer/pull. That it is 
normal for it to due this. "

by the fact that Suzuki is not really 
known for sedan cars, but this car is 
wonderful. The fuel economy isn't too

their automobiles.  This car is fun to drive and 
handles like a much more expensive 
automobile.  The speed sensitive steering is a 
must.  Also, the first automatic transmission I 
have thoroughly enjoyed using.  Both in 
regular mode and in the ""hold"" mode.  The 
stereo in this vehicle is ""the bomb"".  One 
reason I purchased this car, is that I drove this

at 1500, 2800, 3000, 3450 and finally 
3500 miles. All for excessive smoke out 
of the tailpipe. The car has been in 
the shop since June 1st of 04 with the 
engine taken apart. We where told there 
was a problem with the cylinders or 
pistons. They where not sure and Suzuki 
inc. didn't know what to do about it. 
Well over 2 months later it is still in 
the shop with the engine torn apart. I

suzuki,forenza,2004,LuvMySuzi, 08/01/2004,The Forenza is an EXCELLENT choice,4,"After seeing the commercials, and
advestisements in magazines I decided
that the Forenza was at least worth a
look. At first glance the Forenza looks
a lot like most of the cars in its
class. The exterior styling is fresh and
new. The interior is very well equiped,
especially in the LX modle I purchased.
The most impressive thing about this car
to me is the durability, and quality in
the materials used to make it. After
having an '03 Maxima, and comparing its
materials and quality to the Suzuki
Forenza I found myself amazed. There
really isn't any comparison; the Forenza
just feels all around like a much better
built automobile."

suzuki,forenza,2004,Tamara Lewis, 08/30/2004,Small car - a lot of leg room,5,"I had a Volkswagen bug and had just 
had a baby so I was on a hunt for 
something a little bigger. I wanted a 
jetta or a smaller suv. The forenza  
really caught my eye because it looked 
similar to the jetta. We put my 
daughters car seat in the back of a 
couple of small suv's like a rav-4 and 
when I sat in the passenger seat my 
knees touched the dash and I am only 
5'2. When we put her carseat in the 
forenza we were amazed at how much leg 
room I had. My husband is 6'1 and he 
also had a lot of leg room when 
sitting in the passenger seat. After 
checking out the inside, cheap 
insurance, great ratings and the 
price -  we were sold!"

better warranty and better selection.  
I was very impressed and bought my last 
Thursday.  We just love our new car & 
believe we had made the right choice.  
You have to go & test drive it 
yourself, you will be amazed.  The 
price is incredible compared to what 
you're getting.  Mine is blue & has all 
the features anyone could ask for.  I 
would recommend this car to anyone.  So 
much more room than other cars in it's

excellent & I don't listen to the 
radio..I do now.  I'm VERY pleased with 
my Suzuki Forenza."

far I love it!  Lots of fun to drive 
and lots of great features.  I traded 
in a 99 Acura 3.0 CL.  I can honestly 
say I like the Forenza as much or 
better.  Took it on a 400 mile trip 2 
days after I bought it.  Very 
comfortable and lots of fun.  I almost 
hate to pull into the driveway and get 
out of it."
suzuki,forenza,2004,Toby Michael, 09/19/2004,Impressions,4,"My first impression:  I didn't like 
it.  Then I saw it in person and drove 
it.  Second impression:  I bought it 2 
days later.  It's an incredible little 
car.  It looks so much nicer than the 
others in this segment, at least in my 
opinion.  Coming out of a Pontiac 
Sunfire Convertible, I'm amazed at this 
cars excellent feel."
suzuki,forenza,2004,NIUman, 09/28/2004,Great first car,4,"I really like this car. It is fun and 
easy to drive. I do not like the gas 
milage, but I guess that expected when 
I drive 80 miles a day. $20.00 a tank 
every four or five days is pricy, but 
the overall price of the car is 
unbeatable. It is not much more than to 
buy a quality used car. Great car, I 
would definatly buy another."
suzuki,forenza,2004,pbwaters75, 10/02/2004,Great Car!,4,"We just purchased our '04 Forenza a 
couple of days ago. It is a gret car, 
with great options. I am a little 
concerned about it being the first 
model year, but all reviews looked 
promising. For the money you can't 
beat this car. It has fabulous 
standard options and provides a solid 
ride. I would recommend it to anyone. 
The stereo, warranty, and styling also 
make it hard to resist. When compared 
to some other cars in its class, I 
don't see how anyone could pass it up!"
suzuki,forenza,2004,lovingmyforenza, 10/11/2004,Couldn't be happier,4,"After looking at the Corolla, Civic, and
3 sedan I decided to choose the Forenza
because it had a better interior than
the Corolla and Civic but was cheaper
than the 3.  While 120+HP doesn't seem a
lot, it's plenty for a compact car this
size and I have no problem accelerating
to 75 on the highway.  I absolutely love
the interior design which looks fabulous
and from a car twice this price!  So far
have had no problems and I am really
impressed with GM Suzuki!"

looks great, even when it is dirty.  It
handles well and accelerates with 
ease. It has lots of room and the seat front 
tilts down to take the preasure off 
the upper legs.  This is a new design for 
2004, so look forward to the introduction of 
aftermarket parts to upgrade my car. It does
need mud flaps.  Its only down side is the 
road noise, but this may be cured with a 
tire upgrade."

suzuki,forenza,2004,del rogers, 01/21/2007,Our Suzuki,4,"The car handles great for a car of its type.  Its looks are great especially in black.  The interior is way better than the Aerio's lint trap.  The lighting resembles that of Lexus and Mercedes. I did have a few problems such as the ssps going out shortly after I bought it, and had it repaired three times. The headlights also went out completely. I have also put four headlights in the car in the last year. The center console / armrest really bugs the heck out of me though. I eventually broke the plastic latch, it has been bent both ways from getting in and out of the car and putting weight on it (imagine that, putting weight on an armrest).  The stereo is OK and the headlights dim when you push the brakes. "
suzuki,forenza,2004,gojiman, 04/04/2007,Suzuki dreams,3,"Overall quality and ride is good. I like the idea of it being a heavier car in its class, a little over 2700 lbs. I would only say this, if Suzuki put the muscle it puts into its motorcycles into its cars, WOW! I realize that Daewoo makes most of their autos but this company has such great potential in being more than it is. They say most of Suzuki's cars are quirky and I agree but this is why I like it. I am aware of some of Forena's mechanical problems, they are small and few compared to its competitors. Suzuki still has one of the best warranties in the Industry! Keep on digging in!"
suzuki,forenza,2004,Steve, 02/21/2017,Don't last long.,2,"I bought one of these in 2016 with 82,000 miles on it. I thought I was getting a steal finding a used car in that range with those miles. I was wrong. Car was riddled with problems, belt squeals (busted harmonic balancer), over-heading issues (coolant pipe leak, or head-gasket, I fixed both), among other strange issues. My car died around 92,000, for which I can't completely blame it on the car, but it wasn't a good enough car to replace the engine for. Try to find a used one of these with more than 130,000 miles. They aren't common because these cars don't particularly last. Hard to find parts for. Had to drive to a certain auto parts store because they had the largest selection, local shops had nothing. Frequently ordered parts. Cheap cars, not made to last.
"
suzuki,forenza,2004,Jen, 03/29/2019,Don't Make the Same Mistake That I Did,3,"I should preface this review by saying that, for the first year or so after buying this car, it ran okay. It had some problems that I knew about, but they weren't anything too wild (e.g., a ball joint). I didn't drive it very far, but I wasn't terribly impressed with the fuel economy. I figured maybe I was just biased after owning a Honda Accord. But nope, the fuel economy on the Forena SUCKED. I also hate the seats, which are far too firm. If you're like me and have spinal/cervical pain and/or leg pain, getting in and out will be a chore. Also, front and rear visibility is compromised by the thick roof pillars. The problems with the vehicle really escalated quickly after my boyfriend began driving it for work. Once the car hit about 200,000 miles, things were falling apart left and right. And, since Suzuki no longer manufactures automobiles, trying to get certain parts was time-consuming and expensive. Right now, this turd is festering in my driveway, as it has unexpectedly began stalling. After sinking several grand into this car in the past six months, I've reached my breaking point.

suzuki,forenza,2005,AmberD, 04/29/2016,CUTE DONT GET YOU DOWN THE ROAD!!,1,"I highly do not reccommend this car to anyone! I bought this car at 73,000 miles, 4 days after purchasing from the dealership, master cylinder went out, I also had to replace to clutch as well. Bought the car for 5,000!! To top the cake, now Ive owned the car for 2 years and already put in $3,200 in repairs and still counting!! Timing belt and water pump twice now, valve cover gasget twice, air intake, throttle body, catalyic converter, timing belt tensioner and pulleys, now right after getting it back from timing belt tensioner busting, it is trying to shut off while I am driving!! Gonna cost me anther arm and leg. May i also add i have gone through 2 sets of tires because the car is mechanically built wrong so it voided out my tires warranty due to how uneven the car was built. Sucks in the snow even with studs put on. The only good thing i can say about this car is the speakers, thats it!! Now the car kbb at $1,700 so now i cant even try to see it for what I paid for is as well as what i have put into it!! Its a lemon car made of three cars, Suzuki, Daweo and Chevy!!! The bolts are most likely Chevy parts!! Stay away from this car, it will do nothing but make your pockets run dry and waste of time and money

suzuki,forenza,2005,aposak, 02/14/2012,"Competent, but uninspiring",3,"For basic transportation and cargo hauling, this car is great! It has been rock-solid reliable at 135k miles. Anything over basic transportation, though, and you should look elsewhere. Although a lot of nice features and afterthoughts are included, Suzuki overlooked many of the basics. The lower dash and doors are soft plastic, which scratch and mar easily. The seats aren't particularly comfortable, though they feature several adjustments. Handling, acceleration, and braking are competent, but feel disconnected. I've averaged 24-26mpg combined throughout the life of the car."
suzuki,forenza,2005,JofNoho, 01/07/2010,Lasted 260K miles.,4,"I averaged 50K miles a year since I bought this car brand new. No problems until I had to replace the lifters at 110K, not bad.  Suzuki recommends timing belt replacement at 60K but I pushed it to 100K and then 200K.  It ran great to 260K, it proved to be extremely reliable.  There were a few electrical problems, the passenger's air bag light came on pretty early on and the headlight switch shorted out at about 150k.  Also, suzuki charges a lot for parts and the two mechanics I took it to knew nothing about these cars.  Other than that, it was a surprisingly durable car that got me back and forth from work for almost 5 years."

The CD player has been replaced 2x's and the suspension squeaks! Here's an idea: Suzuki stay with the bikes cause the cars are crap! I traded in a Honda and that's my next purchase.

suzuki,forenza,2005,FGS, 07/26/2010,I love my 2005 Suzuki Forenza Wagon EX,4,"I bought this car for my daughter to drive to college in Tampa while living in Tampa. She put 150 miles of highway driving every day for four years. She graduated and gave it back to me after graduation with 102K miles. There were a couple of highway accidents, two recalls and all the required maintenance checks, but overall this car is outstanding for the price I paid. If it had Bluetooth technology, it would walk on water. I am convinced that this car could not do better for its price tag. Yes, there's that Air Bag light issue, but hey, nobody's perfect. I rate it five stars. Too bad they discontinued making it. It was a great little station wagon with all the comforts of a luxury sedan."

Nice styling.  Great interior.  Decent handling.  Great stereo. Very practical. Dealer is super helpful.  I'm really picky and found a couple of small problems that were fixed easily.  It's made from very proven parts from the world wide parts bin, so it should hold up well.  Some people complain that the engine sounds like a 4 cylinder and that the car doesn't handle like a Porsche.  The same folks would complain if they bought a cheeseburger and it didn't taste like a t-bone steak.  This car is a very tasty cheeseburger indeed. "

The gas mileage was horrible even thougg I did mostly highway driving.
The car left me stranded on three seperate ocassions and I've had numerous electrical problems.
Also went through 8 headlights.

If you're looking for a car in this catagory, stick with the old timers like Nissan, Honda, and Toyota.
You may pay a little more up front but your cost of ownership will be significantly lower.

I will never buy another."

For what I need (a commuter car) it ran great.
I realized it leaked quite a bit of oil, and the antifreeze was disappearing, and the airbag light was on of course.
When speaking to a dealer he said he'd never seen a 2005 Forenza NOT leak a considerable amount of oil.
I had it for a few months, as long as I kept my eyes on the fluid levels, it was ok.

There are so many complaints floating around that raises questions about Suzuki Auto's quality control. Not every vehicle is free of problems, but this is ridiculous. My advice, avoid the Forenza at all costs. The 2005 Forenza Wagon and other problematic models should be put out of their misery. Save your money, do your research, and invest in a more reliable auto. Don't even get me started on trying to get repairs done on this. This by far is the worst car experience I've ever had. :("

The engine is strong, transmission shifting smooth, it should be better on gas though. It responds well to throttle and has good braking. The S mode provides many good standard options included in base price. By far the biggest mistake is in not providing cruise control as part of the standard options. The dealer is unable to install a cruise control as Suzuki does not offer one as a dealer option.  No other cruise control is offered by any other vendors. Now I am stuck with no hopes of ever getting a cruise control installed. "

I don't get the gas mileage that is advertised either. The ride is okay. A lot of extras come standard on this car such as power windows, cd player and tilt wheel.

And now the engine began making alot of noise so I took it in and the repairs are not being covered by that oh so wonderful warranty. I have been told three different causes for this trouble from the samw dealership mechanic. I don't believe they know what they are doing there. I will never own another suzuki again! Poor quality and poor customer service!"
suzuki,forenza,2005,Drumdonald, 08/09/2008,Great Hauler,4,I bought this wagon when my pick up died (of course in front of the dealership). I looked really smart because the price of gas went through the roof right after I bought it. The only problems I have had was first it eats tires which I remedied by going to a 60 series tire instead of the 55 that it comes with. The other problem was when a critter ate the wire harness. The dealer fixed and was able to get most of the cost covered under warranty. I get over 30 mpg and drive the care everyday to work and to drumming jobs. The car holds so much that we take on our vacations even though my wifes car is bigger. It is great car but too bad Suzuki has discontinued it for 09. 
suzuki,forenza,2005,Steven, 10/10/2008,Long Travels!,2,"I would have to say that this little car has very good fuel economy (28/31mpg). I bought the car new and have really put it through its paces. I have taken it from southern Kentucky down to Miami at about 1100 miles, three times. Most of the miles put on this car are highway. A/C went out after about 36000 miles with the warranty running out at 35000. The seat cloth pulls away and doesn't matter if you put it back on track or not.  Its a five speed so that may be why I am gettting better gas mileage than most of the reviews. I had to take it in for some recalls with the water pump and my dim lights went out because of the wirring harness. Overall not impressed but it's still running."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Tigran, 11/14/2008,Hit or Miss,4,"Problems are minor so far. Bought it almost brand new with 4k miles on. AC needs repair every summer, but was covered by warranty so were some recalls. Fuel economy is fair but should be a lot better. Lacks power but overall good value for the money. "
suzuki,forenza,2005,GW Morten, 05/15/2009,Would I buy a Forenza again?,2,"As I take the Forenza to the shop AGAIN, I ask myself if I would buy this one again. No. Not likely. This car has cost us more in the time we have owned it (purchased new) than any other we own or have owned. MPG says 21-22. Have RARELY gotten 20 (more often 16-18). DON'T try to drive in slippery conditions (rain or ice), because you will likely need to be pushed out of the way. I have had equivalent Toyotas in the past, and NEVER had a question about use in winter. Not so, the Forenza. Also, tires are NON-STD size ($$), 7yr/100k warranty is severely limited. It drives ok, but would I get another Suzuki product based on our experience? Sadly, and very disappointedly, No. "
suzuki,forenza,2005,Brian H, 05/20/2009,2005 Forenza is a lemon,2,"In the 3 years since I have bought this car I have had the front headlights fail, the battery die, the tread come off the two front tires, the oxygen sensor replaced and now I'm dealing with a blown head gasket which blasted a hole in the cylinder head compromising the coolant system. By far the worst car I have ever owned."
suzuki,forenza,2005,macnone, 11/25/2009,It's a Chevy ...,2,"I was driving it for some time ... so far I have to be in the dealership once every 4 months ... something is wrong and needs fixin. I'm used to Nissan QUALITY!!! Now I understand why this thing is so cheap! I'm disregarding the airbag light all together - after a dealership it's off for about a month ... then on again. Do I have to pay $300 each quoter or do I ignore it ... transmission is another common problem ... If you want to see a lot of lights on the dashboard all the time - this car is for you, if not - choose a different manufacturer."
suzuki,forenza,2005,sascydharan vasudeva, 12/12/2009,Suzuki Forenza 2005,4,Noisy engine. Needs more power specially in hill area. Fuel economy is not so good. Interior is good and more spacious. Power steering is good. Heated side mirror is an advantage.
suzuki,forenza,2005,firstimebuyer, 01/29/2010,Served us well,4,"We bought our Forenza new and have been driving it for 5 years.  Its not as comfortable as our older bigger car but we expected that.  Its always been reliable, no issues. Never noticed a problem with the power and I spend a lot of time on freeways. Dealerships keep selling out and we end up making a day trip to get checkups, warranty stinks - charge an arm and a leg just for normal stuff thank God nothings gone wrong."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Misty, 02/12/2010,Dont Buy,2,"In this case my car is a lemon. A few months after i purchased the power steering rack went out covered under a warranty. Dec 09' Bolt in idler pulley snapped which caused my timing belt to shred which caused 12 valves to bend. Need a new motor $3,000.00 later. Valve cover leaks a little bit of oil. Other than that the car is great. But needless to say once i pay it off im not going straight to a suzuki dealership.  "
suzuki,forenza,2005,Forenza005, 07/20/2010,So far So good,2,"I bought my 2005 Suzuki Forenza and the dealership failed to give me a car fax and tell me it had been in a tiny wreck prior to purchasing it. I have spent money on it for 60K tune up, cost me 2K, at least that and the tire rims well they bend easily and cost 150 bucks each and can only be purchased at the dealership. But it's paid for and NO I will not buy another one.  I want a Ford or a Honda next time.  My car makes odd sounds and groans like I do when I have to go to work.  But at 116K miles and going and the gas mileage is excellent 35+ on the highway, I will not give her up unless my little silver money drainer dies first.   "
suzuki,forenza,2005,Rick2004, 01/12/2005,2004 Suzuki Forenza,4,"My 2004 Suzuki Forenza is a great car. Make sure you buy it from a repudable Suzuki dealer though because the dealer I purchased my Suzuki at later decided to stop selling them and now I have to drive half an hour away to the next closest Suzuki dealer for maintence. So far after 6 months and nearly 8,000 miles this car is running great. I have had a few problems, but overall the car handles great and is fun to drive. The car guzzles gas, but thats because I drive it almost a hundred miles a day. I highly recomend this car. It can be a little noisy but overall it is a great machine."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Roberet F. Breton, 02/12/2005,2004 Suzuki Forenza,4,I am very pleased with the overall performance and quality of the vehicle. I have owned or driven several Nissan Altimas and this car performs as well. A great car for the money. I would not hesitate to recommend this car to anyone.
suzuki,forenza,2005,dennis, 03/31/2005,Not too bad a car,3,"Well, I have owned my car for one month right now and I have to say that I am rather happy. Did have one minor glitch my clock did not work-service said fuse blew out- just did not know how that could have happned. Anyways, rides fine, has good pickup when giving it the gas, sound system is great, didn't really find the leg room space as others have found. I had an orginal 1986 Pontaic Grand Am which I found to just as have as much leg space as this car but the backseat is more comfortable to sit in as my friends report."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Bill Pearson, 04/12/2005,"Lots of engine noise, very low power",3,Severly lacking in power.  Lousy gas milage for a car of this size.  My 2001 Lincoln Town Car gets as good or better gas milage in town & on the hwy. This car is somewhat unstable on the road. It gets blown around by trucks. Seems to veer a little for no apparent reason. Pulls to right on initial acceleration. No longer own this pigeon.
suzuki,forenza,2005,Steve, 04/13/2005,Gas a Holic,2,"Purchased a Forenza LX Wagon , auto trans and all the bells and whistles. While I did realize the vehicle was no penny pincher in the fuel economy arena, I am disappointed in the fact I am averaging only 13 to 14 MPG in City driving. Automakers need to meet actual fuel economy estimates and not be allowed to sell vehicles that do not meet the advertised specifications. Hoping MPG will increase, and I won't be disappointed in my first foreign auto. "
suzuki,forenza,2005,Steve, 05/12/2005,You won't pass any gas stations,2,"Purchased 2005 Forenza LX wagon with 4 speed AT & 4 wheel abs. Like the style size and features with the vehicle. Like the small engine , I have a new driver in the crew and figured the meek acceleration would be a plus. The car is embarrassing for a 2005 model year vehicle , gas mileage in the city is 13.5 to 14.5 mpg. If you live in a rural area may be an excellent purchase for those of us in city driving the gas mileage makes this vehicle a mistake to buy. First foreign car purchase and it looks to be very disappointing. "

suzuki,forenza,2005,Gabe, 05/30/2005,Decent car/ great price.,4,"I bought the car because it was so cheap. i received a killer warranty and great service from the dealer. I financed the car for 60 months, but as long as i owe money on it it is covered because they gave me a 7 year/100000 mile bumper to bumper. who could beat that. it gets good mileage and is a fairly decent looking car. They beat everyone elses price by thousands and gave me a car easily as nice. "

suzuki,forenza,2005,Chris, 06/14/2005,Bang for your Buck,4,"Great price on a well built sedan.  We were reluctant at first even consider a Suzuki, but after taking it on a long road trip, we were pleasantly suprised about how well it handled, gas mileage, and it's smooth ride.  The only drawback is the lack of cruise control.  By far, you get a lot of car for your money.  Very satisified with this purchase.  "
suzuki,forenza,2005,chad , 06/15/2005,Great looking car for the money,4,"Nice comfortable ride, okay acceleration, great exterior and interior styling, can't beat the 17,500 msrp for all the options you get.   "
suzuki,forenza,2005,Mr. Martin, 06/29/2005,Adaptive Transmission Malfunction,2,Avoid this car at all costs. The bugs in the adaptive transmission software isn't worked out. This results in hard shifting and the car looking for the right gear. This car is a safety hazard waitng to happen.The dealer has trouble getting parts!
suzuki,forenza,2005,kc5yti, 07/09/2005,Wonderful Little Wagon,4,"Our third Suzuki.  I have grown to love them since I bought the 2002 XL-7 that I still have now.  Now we have replaced our 2002 Vitara with the Forenza Wagon.  My wife drives it most of the time, and loves it.  It has been on several long trips and fuel economy averages 26mpg.  22-26 city and 29-34 on the highway.  The styling is great. The seats are confortable, and the back seat has plenty of room for our 3 kids.  It nearly has the same amount of cargo space as my XL-7, but with better fuel econ.  BTW, lookunder the cargo platform in the back, and you will find a spare and more storage space. Amazing. Bravo Suzuki"
suzuki,forenza,2005,4986er, 07/10/2005,Forenza- the first year,4,"I got my Forenza on June 20, 2004, and I have absolutely loved every minute of owning it. I have noticed some minor things that could use improvements, including the air conditioning, the brakes, and my stereo, which seems to have a delay when I play CD's. The fuel definitely has taken a chunk out of my pocket change,because the gas milage isnt that good."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Richard Steere, 07/22/2005,Wow talk about bang for my buck!!,5,"Let's start with options that are worth my money. I went with the base model and there's nothing base about it! Almost power everything, an unbeatable warranty, after I compared it to Hyundai's. It's dependable, comfortable and affordable, I couldn't ask for more in quality and in service! Thank you Suzuki!"
suzuki,forenza,2005,Bryant, 08/28/2005,Inexpensive but reliable,3,"Suzuki has come a long way with design and quality of it's vehicles. The Forenza met all of my expectations and then some for this vehicle class and price range (base $10,499). I own a 5-speed and an automatic S-model version. The automatic shifts smoothly but lacks HP. The manual trans is peppy in comparison but stills lags behind it's competitors (Honda, Toyota, Nissan). Fuel economy is better with the manual trans.  My opinion remains high of this car. Needs a few improvements to be more competitive."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Frank Nabulsi, 09/26/2005,Economically priced,4,"I figured the Suzuki Ex for the price of $13,800 and some change out of the door (OTD) the gamble is worth it. The vehicle is loaded with leather seats, front and back airbag, power windows, full fledge alarm system, Cruise control, AM/FM CD/ Cassette player, Sun roof, Fog lights and audio control buttons located on the steering wheel.  It also has 3 years of road service, 7 years warranty on major mechanical components, for that price I really cannot complaint.  I was driving this vehicle for a week and a half and it give me better gas mileage than my Sienna LE.I owned Town & Country Crysler and they brought nothing but stress and nightmare."
suzuki,forenza,2005,tedrik, 10/12/2005,Two Forenza family,4,"I am writing this review for my wife who was smarter than me and bought a 2005 Forenza LX for less than my 2006!  Oh, well -Suzuki had better discounts on its closeouts!  Anyway, the car rides and handles like a larger sedan - it is very quiet with and  attractive design in and out. it has a great sound system that is usually an option in higher priced cars (140 watt CD / Cassette system).  I am totally happy with my purchase."
suzuki,forenza,2005,sam culp, 10/27/2005,2005 Suzuki Forenza S,4,"The 2005 Suzuki Forenza S is a solid car, it has good handling, nice interior features, which are unexpected at this price.  It beat Honda's price by $6,000.  It is fun to drive, but most importantly, it does not rattle or creak. The engine is set back from the front of the engine compartment, so there is less damage to the engine in the event of an accident.  This car is a good value!"
suzuki,forenza,2005,heathergirlie20, 10/31/2005,Heather's Review,5,My experience my 2005 Suzuki Forenza has been great. I love it.  It's my second vehicle and I wish it had been my first vehicle because I love it so much!
suzuki,forenza,2005,brad, 02/03/2006,Gas Milage is Horriable,4,"I bought a 2005 Suzuki Forenza S. There are many things that I like about the car.  The great warranty is nice to have and its standard features are nice, most base line cars do not have a CD player or steering wheel stereo controls. The main thing that I am not happy with is the gas milage.  I only get about 24-25 which is horriable and that's with babying it.  I think that the main reason is the engine is overworked so it needs to use more gas to get it going.  I have a 2002 Mazda Protege and driving that pretty hard gets about 30 mpg."
suzuki,forenza,2005,d..a. , 04/08/2006,Rides too low,2,"The Suzuki Forenza rides very low, plus there is a obvious lack of respect from other drivers on the road.  I feel inferior.  The gas mileage is disappointing at 24 mpg overall.  I expected 27-28.  If I had a do over, I would have purchased a Suzuki Aerio SX.  It is really nice and is much taller and made better, in the US instead of in Korea.  Or perhaps I would have bought a Toyota Matrix.  Also, I have learned that Suzuki dealerships, I have gone to three of them, are not very professional or knowledgeable about their vehicles.  I had questions about synthetic oil and some other stuff and they gave me the wrong info.  I tried to trade my Forenza back in after only four months and Suzuki wouldn't give me anything for my car.  They did not want it back.   "
suzuki,forenza,2005,MIke, 05/04/2006,Decent....,4,"This car is very fuel efficient. I can usually get almost 400 hundred miles on a full tank of gas. The engine is a little rough, but it's only a 4 cyclinder so that is expected."

suzuki,forenza,2005,Jimmy Hembree, 07/10/2006,Janet's Forenza,3,"My Forenza is eye catching, the ride is good, the handling is good, the interior is good, but the engine performance is lacking. Plus it onlu has average fuel ecomomy.  Its feels more comfortable crusing at high speeds.   The car has been in the shop twice, other than for regular service; once for the driver's side air bag light, and the second time for the driver's side air bag light and for  an entire A/C system failure."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Don LAmb, 07/21/2006,Excellence and Practicality,5,"What a deal.  To get a beautiful car that is comfortable, fully equipped, and convenient, not to mention the fantastic gas mileage that it gets.  I will never buy another American made auto.  I got a100,000 mile warranty, which is unheard of in the American car market and the equivalant American car was $10,000 more expensive."

and fun to drive. It is a surprisingly nice

many options that are cost extra on many
other cars, cush as power windows and

Hondas and this car is right up there with 
the Civic.   "
suzuki,forenza,2005,Ken, 12/21/2004,Good bang for the buck!,4,"  It has the style and standard

nothing but problems, brake lights 
staying on, windshield pops and cracks, 
seats upholster coming undone 
especially front seats (been fixed 
twice), a problem with the power windows, hard 
to start on cold days, does not get 
mileage it should, boggs down, engine 
idles too fast, hard to get in 
reverse.  The dealership tears it up more each 
time it is serviced.  By the way, the 
joke at the 4 wheeler suzuki dealer is that 
you should buy the 4 wheeler because it will
get you where you're going, even if Suzuki's cars
are ""falling apart."" "

Lots of pockets for storage.  Ergonometrics excellent.  Excellent turning radius.  Gallons per miles poor.  Beautiful design in and out.  Good value.  Lots of extras for the $.  Good sound equipment.  Good stability for a wagon.  
suzuki,forenza,2005,Doug, 01/23/2005,Baby Bert,5,"Excellent little car to drive and fun too. I've only found one drawback to the car, when driving,if your passenger who is sitting in the front seat happens to raise up off the seat for a few seconds, the air bag will turn off. This little design flaw could be fatal if the air bag sensor does not reset itself properly. My Forenza only resets when the car is turned off and then restarted."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Robbey Bagwell, 02/24/2005,A car you love to drive,4,"I just love the five speed manual transmission, it really takes the corners like a sports car, when you down shift too third gear and then up to fourth gear arounding the corner.  I have been truly happy the car all around.  I'm a big guy about 280 pounds and don't have any trouble with getting in and out."

I just talked my mother in law into the forenza station wagon.  Don't spend the extra money on the Honda or Toyota you would just be throwing it away.  Two children fit nicely into the back with the travel tv, have taken long trips with no probs and how about the warranty?  I paid more for a new car in 1991 that didn't have half the options.  Wife loves it and we will be looking at the XL 7 to replace the grand cherokee because of the quality and cost of our first suzuki."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Nancy, 04/01/2005,Suzuki's are GREAT!!,5,"This is my 3rd Suzuki.  I bought a 1999 Grand Vitara which I couldn't bear to give up when I bought my Forenza,  It has 125,000 miles on it and I've onlyreplaced the tires and brakes.  The people that can't get great MPG on a Suzuki must check their driving patterns. I get 35 mpg on the Forenza, 25 mpg on the Grand Vitara and got 30mpg on the Tracker.  I fail to understand why Edmunds and ConsumerReports don't rate them higher.  I had a Nissan Pathfinder before my Grand Vitara and couldn't wait to get rid of it after 3 years!!  When they told me how much it was I said SOLD!!! and I had been looking for months!  I bought it on the spot. "

suzuki,forenza,2005,Jason, 05/07/2005,Great car for the money,5,"When you get down to it, it is hard to beat the Forenza.  Power everything, reliable, good handling, and plenty of cash to spare.  Far better then the Spectra which doesn't even come with A/C standard unless you move up to the EX trim and Honda quality for less then its Korean counterparts....ie Hyundai and Kia."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Ray, 05/09/2005,Great car,4,"My parents bought this car two days ago and wow. I'm an automatic man and the manual trans. is very easy to get use to. This car is awsome to drive i've already street raced a dude in a supped up Accord and beat him. The handling could be a bit better and the stopping distance but it is still great. The fuel gage stayed 1/8 past full, but after 70 miles it dropped dramatically. its now has 86 miles and there 7/8 of a tank left which is great. i love this car great trunk room and plenty of cabin space. im 6'1 195 and i have plenty of room.

suzuki,forenza,2005,john, 05/07/2005,A lot of car for the money,4,good more than basic transportation.Comfortable interior with a really good sound system. A nice riding car for its size it does have 4 wheel independant suspension. It seems hard to grow tired sitting in this car on long drives. One nice feature is that the car comes complete no options other than auto or manual trans. My dealership was a very pleasant no hassle dealer.It could use more power on long grades (126 hp) and the fuel economy is alittle short on what I hoped for averaging about 23 mpg with mixed driving.  I was very surprized at how many people approached me to tell me how much they really liked the way it looks. Insurance was also cheaper ( no one steals suzukis I guess
suzuki,forenza,2005,Steve , 05/21/2005,Gas A Holic,2,"Purchased a 2005 Suzuki Forenza Wagon , LX with 4 speed automatic trans and 4 wheel abs. Compared the vehicle to Mitsubishi Lancer Sportback Ralliart wagon 2004. Mitsubishi has better build quality , better engine, overall better vehicle but the dealers here do not want to move the existing 2004 vehicles. The Forenza has an amasing list of standard features. The vehicle is pleasant enough to drive with the fact it is under powered and should have the Aerio engine in this car. City driving brings on the first knowledge this was a poor choice. Gas mileage in city driving with 1000 miles on the vehicle is 13.5 to 14.5 Miles per gallon. I could be driving a motorhome and be less disappointed."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Jean, 05/22/2005,"forenza sedan ""S""",4,"This car has so many features I doubt I could list all of them. With the automatic  transmission it a takes off really fast with a sufficent amount of pedal pressure, but then it seems to shift to low in order to keep the same acceleration. Other than that it's a great car. It has alot of cabin room, great looking interior, and a sleek looking exterior! Everything is automated like windows, gass cap, mirrors (heated) trunk...etc. Seats are manual and uncomfortable. Has driver/passenger, and side airbags. I like the 15"" wheels with P195\55R15 Kumho touring tires. Also has very stylish high intensity headlights. 2 cooling fans on radiator. Has 4 wheel disc brakes. It's a great car for the $."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Cliff Ray, 05/22/2005,Not an Econo Auto,3,The Forenza is not a bad car. However the gas mileage is not good. In the city the best I was able to get was 15 MPG.
suzuki,forenza,2005,Robert Fisher, 06/08/2005,Just bought my '05 Forenza,4,"I just bought this car about a week ago and so far I love it. I'm very impressed with the high level of style & build quality in a car of this price. The styling reminds me of an Audi A4. Like just about everyone else I like all the power gadgets and the 8 speaker stereo cd/tape player that come standard. Don't know about the gas mileage yet but it seems ok. I traded in a Suzuki Swift with 138,000 miles on it. Got en extra $500 off for owner loyalty. I highly recommend this car. Already got one of my friends to buy one."

On a 4000k trip to California and back to Missouri I only average 25 mpg, which is bad for that small of a car; mileage was the main reason that I bought it.

suzuki,forenza,2005,Richard G II, 07/28/2005,Surprised by Suzuki,4,"Being in a labor Union (local 1175 baby!) comes with it an unspoken rule to buy american. I went to dodge, ford, and chevy looking for a compact car to fit my needs (being 21, my dream vette is still a bit out of my league). After thorough review, I ended up in a suzuki dealership. The warranty alone justified me buying brand new (upgraded to 7/100k bumper2bumper) but the car itself was full of options! I couldnt make myself go back to the other dealerships and pay more for less!"
suzuki,forenza,2005,Alan Jay, 07/29/2005,Nice Little Wagon,4,"Nice practical wagon.  I average about 25 MPG with the automatic, better on highway trips.  Great interior.  I love the styling.  Engine a little noisy on hard acceleration, but quiet at speed. The 2.0 Holden (Australian GM made) engine has a good long record for reliability in Europe, where it is used a lot.  The ZF (German designed) auto transmission had a couple of minor quirks, but was fixed with a recent program update. It now is buttery smooth.  Great sound system. It has started and run flawlessly.  No squeaks or rattles.  Handling is competent, but not sporty.  Ride is quite good for a small car.  Seems sturdy. (It weighs almost 3000 lbs.)"
suzuki,forenza,2005,Matthew, 08/02/2005,Suzuki Forenza,4,"The Suzuki Forenza is one of the best vehicles I have owned or driven.  It is very comfortable to ride in and to drive.  The vehicle looks like a top notch ride, but it comes at a fraction of the cost.  The interior comes with plenty of places to store any items that might need to be placed out of the way.  In all, this is a very roomy and comfortable vehicle to own."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Jennifer Whang, 08/22/2005,When You Need an Inexpensive Wagon,4,"This is a great buy for people who want the utility of a small SUV for a small price.  Don't overlook all of the little things that are included, you might find a similar vehicle from a Japanese maker, but you won't find this many standard features.  Besides I think it looks great, and drives well for a commuter / shopping trip car."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Mary Tinsley, 09/01/2005,Forenza Review,4,The car is roomy in the front but less leg room in rear seating area.  Easy to handle and rides very smooth. One drawback on the interior is the steering wheel blocks the speedometer. The seats adjust easily and are quite comfortable. Controls are easy to reach and use. Gas mileage is great I get around 34-35 hwy. It is an attractive looking car with many pluses when you compare it with the price of the vehicle. It handles well in heavy traffic and stopping is not a problem and has a good turn radius. Easy to parallel park. Overall the best vehicle I have owned and really liked the price.
suzuki,forenza,2005,Steve, 09/01/2005,Neat Car,4,"I love the VW Jetta-like interior dashboard look of my new Suzuki Forenza.  The inside is very nice for such a low priced vehicle. The outside reminds me of the typical Hyundai look and it did not surprise me to learn that these are built in S. Korea at the GM Daewoo plant. i live in SoCal where everyone drives in the 80's and this car has no problem keeping up but the gas mileage suffers at 24 mpg. I backed it down to the 70's and now i'm getting 28 mpg and I'm okay with that. I have the 5 speed. I test drove the gutless and wonderless automatic transmission and passed. The car is a little slow building rpm's in 2nd gear, but with all of the features this is one neat little car. The locking system is strange, I seem to always have an unlocked car?"
suzuki,forenza,2005,AznFineDude, 09/08/2005,Decent Car,4,The Suzuki Forenza is a good value and a great looking car. It's gas millage would be better if a more powerful engine is in place. 
suzuki,forenza,2005,Lori, 09/18/2005,Great Car,4,"I just bough the Forenza S, and I love it. I traded a Daewoo Lanos for it, and it is a huge improvement. I love the way that it handles, the room, comfortable seats, and the whole interrior design. The trunk space is great too. If you are looking for a car with basic style plus a little more with a great warranty, I would strongly recomend this little family car."
suzuki,forenza,2005,psc210b, 10/13/2005,Gas Guzzler of a Small Wagon?,2,"I have put 2,000 miles on my Suzuki Forenza LX wagon. Just like others have said, the fuel economy is terrible on this car. I have gotten less than 15 mpg in the city and 27 mpg in highwaydriving. Also, the steering wheel is always vibrating when it starts to take off. I like its design though, pretty much looks like a Jetta wagon. I would hope these are all the problems I have for the next few years."
suzuki,forenza,2005,brad, 12/03/2005,"Nice, but work on MPG",3,"I bought the 2005 Suzuki Forenza S.  I think the main reason I bought this car was because of the 100,000 mile warrranty with full transfer to the next buyer. The gas mileage on mine around town and a little freeway is about 25-27 mpg in Utah. My 2002 protege gets about 29 avg. so they need to work on that. The car has very good standard features that most base models do not come with. Mine is having some issues with the air bag sensor and some dashboard noise while diving. All and all, this is a great car for the price!"
suzuki,forenza,2005,BigAl, 12/04/2005,Excellent,5,"I love everything about this car.  It gets good fuel economy, has style, ergonomics, decent handling, and a nice interior.  To top it all off, it's a bargain.  I can't believe the reviewers are so negative on this car.  They must just be biased."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Justin Maier, 02/17/2006,Suzuki Forenza,4,"I love my Forenza. I've had it for almost six months now and everything about it is great. I feel like it has a good amount of power, especially in the higher gears and at higher speeds. This car is everything I needed in a car."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Mike, 02/19/2006,Don't Buy This Car,2,"Proceeding up a bridge in my Suzuki Forenza, the engine died taking out the power steering and brakes. The Forenza began to roll backwards into oncoming and merging traffic in a two lane construction area. I was able to avoid a serious multi-car accident with quick use of the emergency brake. The dealer wasn't immediately sure what went wrong and contacted Suzuki Tech Support. Sight unseen, they were told to order a list of parts including water pump, timing belt and complete head assembly. Suzuki denied the frequent occurrence of this failure, but knew the exact parts to replace? The water pump pulley had been installed backwards, allowing the timing belt to skip. This car is unfit for American roads. Recall it!"
suzuki,forenza,2005,tony, 05/14/2006,This is a good car,4,"The Forenza has pretty good performance, a very good body style, an excellent stereo, stops on a dime, and comes with lots of extras that other models of this type do not have.  Go with the LX or EX model and you get what you pay for.  They say it has a lot of wind noise, but when the windows are up this car is very quiet and smooth."
suzuki,forenza,2005,minewasadeal, 05/29/2006,I got a deal,4,"Paid $11,060 out-the-door for my Forenza.  I needed a wagon and it turned out that I couldn't find anything else comparable for the price.  The price I got it for is actually better than you'll get for any econo car.  I don't expect it to be quick so I'm content.  I average 27 mpg in city/hwy driving.  It never gets less than 25 and I got 34.2 once on the highway.  As far as the ride comfort, handling, braking and road feel go, they're fine and will only improve with top grade performance Michelin tires.  The Kumho's it has are admittedly mediocre.  If you need a wagon it's a great deal.  HAGGLE with the dealer.  This is my 17th car and I know how to get a good price.  I'm sure you can too.  It's well worth $11,060."
suzuki,forenza,2005,Wade, 06/12/2006,Good ride,4,"I bought my car in December, '05. I love my Forenza. I drove it from Louisiana to Colorado and had great gas milage. I bought it to commute to school and it has served that purpose well.  If you need a car to get around town or are a college student, get this car!"
suzuki,forenza,2005,Wratchet, 11/10/2006,How to Pick a Lemon,3,"The car was great-at first. It ran clean, and was not so quick but picked up fast. Though I kept the car in great condition, oil changes on time, here I am not even two years later finding problems with the transmission that no mechanic can seem to fix.  I used to love the car until it started to experience shifting problems-in an AUTOMATIC!  This is very disappointing to say the least. "
suzuki,forenza,2005,semifamous1, 11/29/2006,Outstanding Value,5,I can not believe how much car and extras were delivered for the price that I paid for this vehicle. I expect that it will go up in price just due to how well it has performed compared to other vehicles in its class that cost much higher. I have been very pleased so far!
suzuki,forenza,2005,Angie Ward, 12/11/2006,Best Car Ever,4,I love this car. I have never had a problem with it and it has been driven back and forth across the country five times. My husband is an auto tech and is still surprised at the little amount of work that has had to be done. I have only had to have regular oil changes done.
suzuki,forenza,2005,Kate2Dance, 01/07/2007,"Bad Tranny, Shocks, & Gas Mileage, but Good Looks",3,"I bought this car to commute to work and got decent gas mileage on highway, but horrible in town mileage of less than 20 MPG. At less than 30,000 miles, the transmission went bad and the rear shocks are knocking and rattling!  Note this car was purchased to commute to work via a one hour drive on the interstate, so most of it's mileage is highway! With a bad tranny and rear shocks at under 30,000 miles (most of which were highway) and very poor in town gas mileage, you're better off buying something else! I'm buying a Honda next time, or anything else, for that matter!"
suzuki,forenza,2005,Tato, 01/10/2007,Best Wagon for Your Buck,5,My experience with this wagon has been marvelous. It is sturdy and very reliable on long trips. It is the best value for the money compared to any other brand. It is very economical it gives me 31.27 mpg on highway. It is highly underrated.
suzuki,forenza,2005,AlanJ, 01/10/2007,Very Satisfied,4,"I bought this car almost two years ago and am closing in on the 36,000 mile mark.  It had a few minor initial quality problems that the dealer happily fixed in the first month.  Since then it's been flawless.  It is a great value, and is comfortable for a big tall guy like me.  It hauls a big load without complaining and it has a great stereo and nice styling. Its handling, acceleration, and fuel economy are adequate, but not stellar.  High speed highway cruising is fine though.  The automatic transmission shifted harshly at first, but a simple reprogram has it shifting like butter.  Overall this is a nice car, I wish it was more popular."
suzuki,forenza,2005,SmallWagonDriver, 01/27/2007,A Sleeper that's a Flat-out Steal!,4,"We absolutely love this car!  And I hate cars (where's those jet-packs that those futurists said we'd have by now?).  Anyway, after extensive internet research, my wife and I decided this was it (first ever new one). It looks great, drives great, feels great, and it didn't break the bank.  Though it's only got 30,000 miles on it, it has not let us down once nor has it been in a shop except to get oil and tires changed. It has plenty of room (hauls an upright bass just fine), has great safety features, has a decent stereo., and has plenty of power.  It's a superb, solid highway cruiser!  Folks, if you want an inexpensive wagon that sure doesn't look and feel like one, the Forenza is it! 

O.K., here's an update after driving the Forenza wagon for these last 15 years. 207,000 miles and the engine still doesn't use any oil unless it's pushed hard (i.e. 80-85 mph across Montana in mid-summer), but still doesn't use much even then. With regular maintenance, it still feels solid and runs great. No leaks, no noise, everything inside still works...it is impressive. However, and this is a big however....it's a clutch-eater. And I've driven sticks since the 70's so I'm confident to say it's not operator error. It is now on its 4th clutch, which includes the one from the factory. And that only lasted 94,000 miles. The second clutch went quick, and I suspected mechanic incompetence with that one. But other than that, I'm still happy with it. It's just a great, no-frills car that has never left us stranded regarding the engine or the electrical system. Luckily when the clutches went, we weren't out in the middle of nowhere. Other than that, can I still recommend one of these? You bet. Even with a manual transmission as my problems may have been a fluke. I can't vouch for the automatic transmission, though, although I have read some mixed reviews. You can pick these up cheap with reasonable amounts of miles on Craigslist and such. But I'm driving this thing until it totally and finally gives up the ghost. And it looks like that may be a while!  

Looks like the good folks at Edmunds would like me to update my last update! Well, since Covid hit, the car has only been driven about 5,000 miles more (I get to telework) and it still runs like a champ. So at 212,000 miles, I can still say I'm pretty darned happy with its performance. Simple and reliable (clutch still doing fine), good gas mileage, still doesn't seem to use oil unless I push it hard for a long period of time (as mentioned earlier....80-85 across Montana on a 100 degree day with just a teeny level drop on the dipstick). I'd take this car anywhere without hesitation. I think what's really helped is I just do simple maintenance like checking and topping off fluids, changing the air filter, changing oil (5,000 miles), keeping the battery clean, keeping tires rotated (at the tire shop).....just basic stuff like that that doesn't take a lot of effort. And I can barely use a screwdriver so I don't/won't try to do anything more. Fortunately I have good, honest mechanics for that. I'd still recommend this car for good, simple and cheap transportation. Like I mentioned earlier, you can find these for reasonably low prices on Craigslist. However, for disclosure, we did buy ours new and have kept up with all recommended maintenance from Suzuki (well, pretty much). And I can't vouch for the ones with automatic transmissions. However, if you can find a wagon with a stick for cheap (and preferably with reasonably lower miles), do give it some serious consideration, as I think these cars are vastly undervalued and underrated. And that's a big plus for anyone shopping for a car (especially a wagon) with limited finances.

suzuki,forenza,2005,Mstarr, 05/22/2007,Happy so far,4,I have had my Forenza now for 2 years. No major problems except for the seat fabric keeps coming off. Fuel mileage is poorer than expected. Ride is ok.
suzuki,forenza,2005,Money Maker, 03/17/2008,Pretty Good For The Money!,4,At first I doubted Suzuki's quality but I was wrong. This car has been for the most part reliable. I've had few minor issues but nothing major such as recalls but other than that not much of anything. I found out GM Daewoo created these cars for Suzuki and I guessed there's a pile of junk but I've seen much improvement through Daewoo. For the price you get a decent car with a good amount of features.

suzuki,forenza,2006,Conor, 01/26/2016,NOTHING BUT TROUBLE!,1,"This car didn't look bad, run bad, but was nothing but problems!  The mileage was also not that great.  My girlfriend bought this car used before we were dating and it was a total bust.  It didn't last her 3 years and died from a bad head gasket or similar at 86,000 miles.  I told her it was time to move on once the coolant and exhaust started mixing.

Here is what went wrong.
-Transmission Range Sensor
-Valve Cover Gasket
-EVAP Purge valve and cylinder
-Struts
-Other sensors I forgot about but this car was the champion of check engine lights.
-HEAD GASKET (This was the nail in the coffin)

suzuki,forenza,2006,complexityiii, 06/14/2015,Transmission Bad,3,A Mechanic showed that there had been many warranty claims concerning the transmission. Suggested that I change the transmission in 2015. The car was a 2006 and only had 6200 miles thus I thought he was wrong. Found he was right for at 7200 miles it started not shifting in the lower gears. I had to manually move the automatic shifter into 3rd.
suzuki,forenza,2006,rgunn1, 04/08/2011,more problems than its worth.,2,"While i do like the looks and comfort of this car, and initially thought it was an excellent car, my opinion rapidly changed.
The throttle sensors have gone out twice (at my expensive of course), the check engine light comes on & stays on ''its nothing'' says suzuki who then reset it, only for it to come on a day later.
and now, i have a rattle that they cant give me a straight answer on. one mechanic says wheel bearings, another said its the transfer case (its front drive and doesnt have a transfer case!!! good job suzuki training your mechanics), another says its the exhaust shielding.
but no one will put
it in writing what the problem is. the car is junk, better off with a bicycle. "

The car ran great and I took it to 125K miles and am selling to a family member as I upgraded my personal ride.

The Suzuki does have its known issues like the Transmission Selector Switch, dashboard lights coming on and a few other minor glitches but I did my 3,000 mile oil changes and was very happy with the overall experience."

Where do I even begin? The check engine light comes on constantly; it has comes on at three times in the past year for me. Each time, I spend $300 getting it ""fixed"" only to have it come on again soon after. The paint on the door handles chips. This car SUCKS during long trips..and by long, I mean trips over an hour. Its noisy, drives poorly and has difficulty accelerating. It also jerks every time I put it in reverse. The battery drains very easily, I've spent $ getting that replaced. Gas mileage is terrible.

I don't disagree with any of them. I got mine with 55,000. 34 months and 55,000 miles later I'm now looking for a new engine.
Like a previous reviewer experienced, I too had a problem with the shift switch.
Next to go was my transmission. Those were replaced under warranty.
Other than that I was getting new rear pads almost twice a year.
That's until water all of sudden showed up in my oil. Despite the issues, I like the way the car rides.
Call me crazy, but I'm putting another engine in and driving it until the wheels fall off."

Worth more to fix than the cars value so I decided to junk it.
This was the only ""necessary"" major repair work I had to do on the car.
In 7 years I never had to change out the brakes, the clutch or anything else.
Replaced the serpentine belt once and the battery just once.

Then at 49,000 my clutch and all the components broke. That was 850 out of my pocket not including towing...

Less than a month after her purchase, the transmission selecter switch went out. This switch failed again after 8,000 miles. I stocked up this time.

The car required a full tune up at 35,000 miles. The plugs were dust. I have never seen plugs look this bad in a car with this few miles. I replaced the timing belt while I was at it. I had a hunch this was the next item to fail.

I just replaced the struts with 50,000 miles. They were absolute junk and would not stand on their own without the springs.

This car has been an absolute nightmare from the start. Shortly after purchasing we ran into some financial troubles (as everyone did) and ended up paying the loan off and now own the car outright. We have put more than $18,000 in this car over the last 7 or 8 years and every time something is fixed, something else blows up. Normal wear and tear on a vehicle are understandable, but we had it in the shop every 3 months at least. Not to mention everything that went wrong with it was a safety issue."

I believe that Suzukis in general are ""decent"" cars, not at the same level of say Toyota or Honda, but same or perhaps better than American ""small"" cars. I was in the market for a Corola, but found the price too high. I paid at least 20% less, so I can live with the compromises. I purchased a fully loaded 5-speed and enjoy the performance once I get out of 2nd gear.  The ""get up an go"" from a dead stop is too slow and so is the 1st to 2nd gear shift, once you're shifting out of 2nd it's a rocket!  Gas mileage is unacceptably low (22-26mpg)."

Maintenance included changing the oil, synthetic only, filters and the rear brake pads. Suzuki also replaced a fried splice pack for the headlights, under recall.

So here is time #4. The door handles are weak. All have broken off except the driver door. In the winter is the worse. The engine light stays on and after 4 mechanics and ranger switches and what not. Turns out condensation builds up on motor and that is way it is build or something.  It has trouble accelerating.

I found the brakes and airbags seemed to be extra on all the other cars. I needed a good reliable car to take me around the Western US. I am not technical or know much about cars but I think I did great for the cost, quality and warranty."
suzuki,forenza,2006,suzuki sucks!, 06/26/2006,"2006 Forenza - $15,000 paperweight!",2,"Look, if you are about to buy an '06 Forenza, STOP!  Don't do it.  About 1/4 of the 2006 Forenza line has a cold start problem.  Meaning after that you let it sit a while it will not start or runs really rough.  I am not the only one expercing this problem.  I took to the dealer (I've only had it for four days) and they said that there is something wrong with the fuel pressure and that Suzuki is aware of it and that when they know how to fix it they will give us a call!  DON'T BUY IT!  They gave me a rental, but I still have to pay for something that dosen't run right and that is brand new.  I've got a lawyer now it's time to sue."
suzuki,forenza,2006,roy71, 01/14/2011,I like !!,4,"Well, we got the Forenza 6 months ago with 29,000 miles. It now has 36,400 miles and only ""problem"" was one bent rim, which was no cost to us, the dealer even put a new tire on it for us =) I think its fun to drive, we have the 5speed manual. The design is really awesome, it beats the boring civic or corolla hands down. It has proven reliable so far. It seems like you get a really bad Forenza or a really good one. Ive read the reviews, after we bought it, if i would had read them before we bought it, honestly i probably would not have purchased it, but i dont regret purchasing it =) "
suzuki,forenza,2006,KarmicX, 10/06/2010,Door Handles,3,I just called Suzuki because I heard of the recall on certain Suzuki models. The door handles have all broken. They want to do nothing but charge me a phenomenal rate to fix them. It's a flaw they had when using cheap door handles. I love that Suzuki is standing behind their product. I drive with my kids all the time and this is a safety issue. If you can't exit the vehicle without unrolling the automatic windows and the back passengers can't even reach their exterior door handles to exit doesn't this constitute a severe safety issue.
suzuki,forenza,2006,Uni, 02/24/2016,"If you can get a deal, go for it",3,"If you're paying a lot for this car, I really wouldn't recommend purchasing it. I've already replaced the TRS 3 times and it's really annoying to deal with. The plus is that you can still drive with the wonky TRS but it's uncool when you're going up a hill and it kicks into a different gear. So you go really slooow. Another thing is that the door handles suck and are really weak. I've had my two indoor backseat handles break off and those ironically cost more to fix than the actual TRS.

Other than this bs this car has been really trusty with no other issues. Which is good, because it already has a constant and unavoidable TRS problem. If you can put up with paying 300$ every year for a new TRS than this car is fine for you. Otherwise wouldn't recommend it. Not even for a new driver because what kind of teen has that kind of money to dish out?

suzuki,forenza,2006,firebirdz, 08/31/2010,Very Dependable,4,"I have had this vehicle for 3 years and I couldn't be happier. I have never had a car work so great for me. It has never broken down. I have had to take it in for a couple of repairs/recalls but all in all spent maybe $600 in the three years for maintain (Well that isn't counting registering the auto which is expensive). You would think a car that looks so small would be small on the inside but it is so roomy!! I do have an issue with the paint on the plastic door jams it chips very easily. So I had so sand them and re paint them myself which is okay. The biggest thing for everyone to remember, take your auto in or perform 10,000 mile check ups and it will take care of you regardless."
suzuki,forenza,2006,crisp, 06/05/2008,I like it.,4,"The dealer told me to buy this car new over a used Honda Civic. I'm actually quite impressed. It did have the not-starting problem for a week, thats gone. 2 recalls. 1 for the seatbelt latch and another for the headlight wiring harness. I put 87 octane in it and get around 30 mpg combined. Stellar if you ask me. Very quiet car at rest. The a/c freezes. Perfect. Spins the tires when I want. Brakes could go for 100k miles. I paid 11k for this car new and other than bad resale it's an awesome commuter for sure/"
suzuki,forenza,2006,Great Wagon, 08/11/2008,Great Suzuki Wagon 2006,4,"I purchased my wagon used with 13k miles for $9,200.  I previously owned a Grand Vitara but it was too bumpy on the road. The wagon is smooth, average 25 mpg, can get as much as 27.6 on highway. I used 87 octane and read a former owner's review and he suggests to use 91 octane for more miles. Just wish there was a rear release button for the trunk door. I now have 20k miles and no problems. I definitely would recommend this wagon over a SUV. Maybe one day they will improve the gas mileage and softer seats. The leather seating is so much better, but i didn't want an additional $1500 expense. Overall I am happy."
suzuki,forenza,2006,Stacey, 05/11/2009,Drive for a living,4,I drive for a living 300 miles a day in my forenza. Yes I had to change the selt belt but that was free. Other then normal required maintance; my car has been perfect. Gas mileage is great for the size of the car since I fill up the tank everyday. Although the tires come in one size; you can actually have one size bigger put on and its been cheaper and has gotten better gas mileage. For someone who drives for a living; it has been a great vechile. 
suzuki,forenza,2006,nw, 06/24/2009,Will buy another,4,"Bought new-   after I ""got to know"" the vehicle I really like it-- its made several long trips-- I've only changed the oil and replaced tires and a couple of headlights-approching 100,000 miles in a week or so-- when its time to replace I will buy another-  it looks ok too-- Wish it were rated as a safe vehicle- Thats somewhat of a concern- but all in all very well pleased."
suzuki,forenza,2006,D.Jones, 10/22/2009,Battery Problems & Transmission Censor,1,"I have had my car since 2006 and it has been problem after problem.  First my Transmission censor went out which cost me roughly $200.00 dollars. The transmission is still skipping sometimes when I drive.  Now the batter will not keep a charge.  I have had everything check thoroughly and the watts on my alternator, starter are good.  Replaced the batter and the card still have problems.  I have checked and there is no recalls on this car for major things such as this.  "
suzuki,forenza,2006,Alisha, 01/26/2010,"Buyer Beware!!!!! Cheap paid, cheap made",2,"I purchased my Suzuki in 2007.  I have enjoyed the vehicle until just recently.  I have started to have transmission problems and I have not even hit 50,000 miles yet!!!  The only place that will touch it because of the ""great"" warrenty is 60 miles away. The Suzuki dealership told me to just drive it in and if it breaks down then I will have to pay for the cost of towing as the warrenty does not cover towing costs that far away.  The dealership that sold it to me flat out lied to my face and said they work on Suzuki, but when asked today they said they meant giving oil changes and such.  This will be my last Suzuki, next time I'm going American and will save myself the stress and headache!"
suzuki,forenza,2006,Dean, 09/24/2005,What a difference a year makes,3,"I have the 2006 wagon.  Im 6ft 1, 300lbs, and very comfortable in this car. The exterior styling is reminiscent of a smaller version of the dodge magnum, and the 7yr-100000 warranty speaks for itself. Its interior is styled nicely, and you get accessories for thousands less than similar vehicles in this category.  fuel econmy is superb so far, and it holds the road like a glove.  Its not a pavement burner, but it gets out of its own way when it needs too.  safety features abound, hidden storage everywhere, and plent of room for rear passengers.  An excellent car as is the whole 2006 line. Catch one if you can...."
suzuki,forenza,2006,KillerInstinct, 05/04/2006,Just bought!,4,"We needed a small car with some features for the son, and we found it to be an attractive vehicle. The Verona looks good.  It doesn't have too much horsepower, but it has a nice body style and it's good on gas. The premium package has a power sunroof, alloy wheels, fog lights and remote keyless entry. Plus a big trunk for storage. If you're lookin' for ecomony, this is the car, if you're lookin' for power, this isn't the car. The 3yr/36,000 mile bumper to bumper and 7yr/100,000 mile powertrain warranty are great. It's an affordable car, good for first time buyers that can't really afford a whole lot. The dealership offers free tires for life. The was kinda the kicker! ) Enjoy your new car."
suzuki,forenza,2006,ShenValleyGirl, 06/21/2006,Beware! - It May Not Start,2,"If youre considering buying a Suzuki Forenza, test drive it more than once. Beware of the Intermittent ""no start"" problems occurring on many 2006 models. The A/C output is not good nor is the acceleration. If youre 58"" or taller, you may find its a bit difficult to get in and out of,  especially when wearing high heels. I bought mine in late May, had it all of 7 days and190 miles before the no start problem occurred. In fact, it happened two days in a row. I took it back to the dealership (35 miles from my home) for diagnosis and repair after the second incident. I thought the first one was just a fluke. It was there 7 days. I have it back now and the engine revs high and idles rough every morning."
suzuki,forenza,2006,One Satisfied Custom, 05/26/2006,I Love Driving This Car,4,"The Forenza Wagon is a great driving experience. It handles well on highways and in street driving, has a great turning capability, and gets OK gas mileage (there are more fuel effiecient wagons out there). The exterior styling is great, it looks like an Italian import. For price and overall value, I could not be happier."
suzuki,forenza,2006,Sucker, 10/12/2006,The ForenzGetAboutIt :(,2,"Or, more aptly titled, the ""Suzuki Piece of Junk.""  I bought the car in mid-May 2006.  It was trouble free for roughly 600 miles. It has been in the shop consistent every month since then for no crank issues, transmission, dropping the entire subframe, plus a host of others.  I already have a hefty file going on repairs, etc.  There is not enough room here for all of the problems and issues involved with the car.  What a farce!  I just picked it up from the last go around.  The shop had it for a month and the car is still not fixed.  I would very strongly recommend checking out other comparable vehicles in this class if you actually want to own a new car that runs and is reliable. It looks pretty, but mechanically I give it a rating of zero on a scale of 1 to 10."
suzuki,forenza,2006,Steven, 09/02/2017,Don't waste your time!!!!!,2,"I bought the car in 2008 with 14000 miles it was only after six months that the TR sensor went out. Soon after that the suspension needed replaced. It wasn't long after that the inner and outer tie rods needed replaced. The materials are cheap. I had both inner door handles break off with little effort.  The headlight switch had a recall and it costed $100 to replace because the dealership I bought it at went bankrupt the check engine light will always come on for various reasons and each repair was costly because every part seamed to be a dealer part and most of the dealerships were closed by that time so I had to special order them. I had the car for almost 10 years and the transmission final went out on me after only 71000 miles dispite regular routine maintenance. Would of know the transmission was garbage when it would take forever just to get it up to 35mph and that was when I first bought the damn thing. For its size, it has poor fule mileage compared to midsized cars of its time and coolant was always leaking I to the fule system which ment if you didn't catch it in time, the engine would over heat. Stay away from this car all together. Spend the extra money and get a Honda if you love Japanese imports.

suzuki,forenza,2006,moniques, 08/13/2012,Sucks,2,This is the worst car...I have a 2006 and I have had it since 2008...it only had 20000 and I have put power steering pump-900..trans senstors--400..3 timing belts--150each...3 oil leaks--total of 450 and now the timing chain has poped and i need a new engine and cant afford it..thanks Suzuki..oh and the door handles break inside.. and it has bad gas mil and the tires wear down... Whoo I wish I could throw it back at the dealers..if you ever see me driving another Suzuki please know I must of won it
suzuki,forenza,2006,M, 09/23/2005,Only gas saves this car,2,This owner not satisfied with his purchase at all.  At best the car is mediocre.  Great gas mileage and a decent stock stereo makes this car tolerable.  
suzuki,forenza,2006,bcchunk, 03/19/2010,It's not the best car!,2,I have had this vehicle now for 3-4 years and haven't really had major problems. My airbag light won't go off. I've recently had my check engine light come on a lot. My friend says that it probably the transmission. The last time I got an oil change the service guy says I need new brakes and I'll probably need new tires. I'm coming up on 60K miles and the service for that is over $400. Not cool. I don't want to put any more money in this car.  The car doesn't really have a high value and the suzuki dealerships are going out of business so when trying to trade this in most companies are only giving me $3-4K.  I should have left this vehicle where it was and tried for a nissan altima.
suzuki,forenza,2006,carreview, 07/02/2010,good car,4,"We have had our forenza for a week now and love it. We have the manual transmission which i recommend(better gas mileage). We have the base model but you don't feel like you have a base car. The materials feel very nice, they don't feel cheap, the styling looks great inside and out. Very comfortable to ride and drive in. It does have a surprisingly roomy interior. The trunk space is also large and legroom in the back seat is roomy. I would recommend this car to anybody. "
suzuki,forenza,2006,tedrik1, 10/12/2005,Reliability in an upscale package,4,"I purchased my Suzuki Forenza (premium pkg, automatic) after test driving the Toyota Corolla and the Nissan Sentra.  What sold me was the quality of the materials, the great build quality and exceptional ride and handling.  As long as you don't take corners like a sportscar enthusiast there is hardly any lean. The quiet ride at highway speeds makes you feel your in a much bigger sedan.  There is some minor wind noise that is only noticeable in the abscence of any sound system / conversation (not so likely).  The interior is upscale in quality and materials and really attractive with the black / silver dash / controls.  My first tank of gas only yielded 20 mpg, but that was mostly city driving. I am completeley satisfied!"
suzuki,forenza,2006,HORRIBLE CAR!, 10/01/2008,Completely Dissatisfied,1,"My Forenza has been nothing short of a nightmare. I have had to take it into the dealership 4 different times for the same transmission problem not to mention a brake light switch burning out.  My computer panel falling out of its brackets leaving it dangling by my feet, my rear view mirror coming out of its mount, and having both the passenger and driver side door handles complete snap off.  I only have approximately 45,500 miles on my car, and I have had to put up with all of these problems. The warranty is great, but when you have to take the car into the dealership at least once every four months, it's not worth it. I am definitely trading it in for something that is not a piece of crap."
suzuki,forenza,2006,R.Johnson, 11/08/2008,Will not buy another one,1,"My daughter's car and my niece's car and one other lady I work with they all have had electrical problems. If you want a cheap car, great on gas this is it. But it does not ride very well and the size tires that it takes do not last, everyone said that the P195/55R15 are a low rated tire that will only last 20k miles max and they weren't kidding!"
suzuki,forenza,2006,Bored Honda Honey, 01/12/2009,Love...no...Like It,4,"I just purchased this car a few days ago and I read the reviews that were writen here before I purchased. (Thank you all). My 2002 Civic was totaled and the best part is it was paid for.  This car is cheap but some of the features make it not as boring as the Civic. They are both noisy but this car is more fun to drive. I have not had the starting problem reported in other reviews. It may have been worked out by the previous owner. I am not in love with it, but I like it. I drove to an event and when my friend go in she immediately commented on the increase in comfort/space over the Civic. Great choice for a first car for your teen."
suzuki,forenza,2006,heather_2011, 01/18/2009,Buyer beware,1,"I traded in my beloved Oldsmobile that has 175,000 miles on it for our current Suzuki Forenza that had 30,000. It seemed like a smart idea since we drive between states quite a bit. Were we ever wrong! From the get go this car has been nothing but trouble. I had it into the dealership 5 times for the same problem, corporate offices had to step in and fix it finally. Now it is parked because it won't start and with paying a car payment I just don't have the money to have it into the shop every other week. This was the first car that I have owned that is considered foreign. I'll never do it again. "
suzuki,forenza,2006,RCassell, 01/20/2009,Overall Disappointment,3,"When I first got my Forenza I absolutely loved it, the styling and ride were seemingly above class. I purchased it used with 6,000 miles on it.  Then, when it hit 20k miles, there was a problem with the brakes and it wouldn't go into gear. Needless to say, the brakes are only covered to 12k miles. Now, the door handle fell off, my speedometer is off by 5+ mph depending  on your intended speed, a valve gasket is blown, and the power steering pump needs to be replaced. It only has 33k miles on it! This shouldn't happen, and while the warranty covers it, I'm still disappointed that I spent 10k on this when I could have bought a different make and had less problems."
suzuki,forenza,2006,proud costumer , 02/13/2009,Suzuki Costumer,4,"This car has a lot of complaints and I don't think that they are necessary. It's a $13000 car, what do you expect, a tuned engine from BMW and Mercedes and Audi? This car is not built well but should last you a good 3 years. I don't like the gas mileage but it is a great upgrade from a 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee. 14mpg city 17mpg highway so I think it is a good car, even though it won't last you 10 years like a Camry. I would consider it if you are looking for a good used car."

suzuki,forenza,2006,Suzuki1, 01/12/2008,Better Gas Mileage?,4,"I bought the car in Oct. of 2006. I have had no major problems concerning this car. It fits me and my wife, who is 6'1"" very comfortably, with our three children in the backseat. I am truly amazed at the buildmanship of this car. I rolled it off the highway in July of '07. The car only sustained undercarriage damage as well as minor body damage. It held up considerably well considering I flipped off a 40 ft embankment. I have to agree with the right type of octane. If you use 91, there is a considerable mpg increase. I still drive this car today, and it is just as reliable as when I bought it two years ago."
suzuki,forenza,2006,Jessica, 07/17/2009,So unreliable it is scary,3,"I bought the car a little over a month ago. About two to three weeks after I bought the car, I went into the store for groceries and came back out to have the car not start at all. When I turned the key, the car didn't even make a sound like it was trying to turn over. Had to get car jumped. Bought new battery thinking that was the problem. Hours later I went out for something and it did it again. Had car into dealership the next day and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with it. I traded in a Ford Escort for this. I miss my old car. I drive with a jump box now and have to use it to start the car sometimes. I'm scared I'll get stranded somewhere. "

suzuki,forenza,2006,hortega, 10/07/2010,Review,3,"I bought my Suzuki w/19,000 miles/Jan of 2007,I have about 95,700 miles now with same transmission problem at this minute.I have driven this car with no problems to Texas twice.I got good gas mileage and smooth comfort I did change to better tires,I also did a lot of LA street driving with no problems up until last Oct when I first felt the jerk of the car when I put the gear in reverse.I have been driving it on and off.If it jerks I turn it off and wait a few minutes and start it up again listening for the idle to come down thats when I put in D. Looking for the part so I can get someone reliable to install in the Los Angeles area any hints.   I love it except for transmission problem."
suzuki,forenza,2006,greg, 02/03/2008,Great car,5,"I am so impressed with this car.  The price is great, the performance is impressive, and the look works.  Not so generic looking as the hondas and toyotas.  Mine is the premium with the alloys and moonroof, white, with a black pinstripe.  Feels like a much bigger car, holds the road well.  Mine's an auto, has great acceleration.  Not as stiff riding as the other cars, but I prefer that.  plus, the best warranty in the country.  What's not to like?"
suzuki,forenza,2006,Chuck Scott, 02/11/2008,Can't go wrong,4,"This is the best car on the market for the price, if you want a no-frills, compact sedan.  I don't mind shifting, so the 5-speed gearbox is fine for me.  The downside to opting for a small, light vehicle is that you don't have the comfort or heft of a larger sedan.  Consequently, it can get a little uncomfortable on a road trip.  But for local trips this makes a good second car.  My only criticism is that the flow of air from the heater to the floor is insufficient.  I had this checked out by the dealer, and was told that everything is operating normally.  Although gas mileage could be better, I am very satisfied with the quality of workmanship, performance and reliability of this vehicle."
suzuki,forenza,2006,tgann, 10/08/2005,The Best Car,4,I have yet to find a problem with this car . I am used to driving Toyotas and Hondas the  the only differnece with the cars are the price and name  I would recommend the Suzuki Forenza to anyone.
suzuki,forenza,2006,Dean, 11/06/2005,So Far So Good!,4,"I have 2,000 miles on my 2006 Forenza wagon with an auto transmission. Im 5' 11"", 265 lbs., and am VERY comfortable in this vehicle. Mag rims are a must; the standard rim / hubcap setup cheapens the look of an otherwise handsome vehicle. I am impressed by how quiet a ride the car has, and doing 80 mph happens without effort. The ride is comfortable, the stereo is supreme, and the warranty, safety features, and other standard features that come with the vehicle are an incredible value in comparison to other imports of its class. I have no complaints whatsoever.  I am very happy so far with my purchase."
suzuki,forenza,2006,Richard E Gugula II, 11/18/2005,First New Car and a Joy to Drive,4,"My Suzuki Forenza purchase so far has been a joy. I got a good deal on it and am impressed at both how nice the car was on the inside and how cool it looked on the outside. I haven't had a single problem with the car, save for the constant stops at the pump. With recent hurricanes making gas lines long here in south Florida, having a 300 mile limit on a tank stinks. Another selling factor had to do with the insurance rate that I recieved from AIG. Full coverage on a financed vehicle for a 21 year old male was actually cheaper than minimum coverage on my previous 2002 Mazda, which is very cool."
suzuki,forenza,2006,Car Dealer's Kid, 12/15/2005,Who wudda thunk?,4,"Edmunds Reviews gave us our first hint about the Suzuki Forenza Wagon and then when we saw the incredible design and size and all the standard options we were ""goners.""  A fantastic warranty adds a big ""plus""  This car is truly, a ""diamond in the rough"""
suzuki,forenza,2006,Jason, 02/24/2006,The Daddy Mobile,4,"I am a large fellow and this car is a perfect fit for me.  I have plenty of leg room and am very comfortable in it.  Its style is just sporty enough to make me feel young (I'm 27) but also responsible (I am a father of 1).  Its safety features are very important to my wife and me and were one of the deciding factors in buying the car.  I've only had my Forenza for a week and I couldn't be happier with it.  Although the wheel covers could be improved to help the look of the car, the car itself far outweighs such petty gripes!"
suzuki,forenza,2006,bErTo, 03/14/2006,Loaded with fun,4,"After comparison shopping, the 2006 Suzuki Forenza Premium w/ABS was my pick.  It has a lot of headroom for my 6' body, loads of standard features, and a nice ride for an ecomonomy car.  The expensive looking exterior and interior add a touch of class that make you wonder if you are driving an economy car.  I love to drive it and recieve many compliments."
suzuki,forenza,2006,badandy, 04/10/2006,Value is Key,4,"If you're looking for value, then this is your car. I found an internet special for $10,400, minus a $500 military discount and I paid $9,999 for a well equipped small car.  Pound for pound the Corolla / Civic are a better quality cars, but in terms of value....my Forenza is the winner.  It looks good, rides well, and has adequate power....what more do you want, unless you want to pay more."
suzuki,forenza,2006,StephenC, 04/21/2006,Nice little car!,5,"This is a nice little car. I like it a lot. As to what was written in the offical review. It is just a matter of getting to know what your car can do. Sort of like bonding with it. Once you know what it likes and dislikes, this car is really fun to drive.    "
suzuki,forenza,2006,lig1948, 04/22/2006,I love my Suzuki,3,"In my opinion the Forenza is one of the best looking traditional station wagons around.  For the price, I don't think you can find anything better."
suzuki,forenza,2006,sm, 04/22/2006,Great Car,4,"This is our second Forenza and we have been extremely happy with the car.  It is very attractive inside and out.  It has a comfortable ride and is very dependable.  I like the addition of the side airbags and the reassurance of the great warranty, but we have not needed to use it yet. The car is a lot roomier inside, both in the front seat and the back, than you expect it be.  When someone rides in the car with me for the first time, their comment is always how surprised they are at how roomy  / comfortable / sharp it is. The Forenza is a comfortable road trip car, too!"
suzuki,forenza,2006,james, 05/18/2006,"Nice car, but not on gas in city driving",3,The Suzuki Forenza is not a bad car.  It is sharp looking and has lots of nice features. It is priced nicely for a family wagon.
suzuki,forenza,2006,Meme, 08/03/2006,My Dream Car,5,"I have not ever owned a new car. I did resaerch on this beauty and loved all that I saw about the car.  After I bought it and have been driving on the interstates and also back roads.  It handles wonderfully with no shaking or sliding in the curves.  It holds the road really well, rain or shine.  I have a sunroof also and it is very nice to open and see the stars or enjoy the sun. My husband was against a convertable so this is the next best thing.  The stereo is awsome. Whether you ride front or back seat you have plenty room.  The trunk has all the room I could use. Did I mention that I came out of a Windstar van to this beauty or that I am a 62 year old grandmother?  No matter what age you are, this car is Kewl."
suzuki,forenza,2006,Marty Charette, 08/05/2006,Awesome!,4,"I just bought this beautiful car and I love it!  I haven't had it for long, so I can't say much, but I am so far satisfied!  But what does that hold button do next to the shifter?"
suzuki,forenza,2006,deon, 08/09/2006,Great Car,5,The 2006 Suzuki Forenza is a great buy.  It provides superior value and has a strong warranty.
suzuki,forenza,2006,Jose Jimenez, 10/02/2005,A Fair Vehicle for the Money,4,"My Suzuki Forenza's confort is aceptable, more roomy than it seems it would be from the outside. It has a huge trunk and looks very expensive. I like the body, the lines look like a Volvo from behind and a BMW from front.  The front lights are beatiful and so are the rear lights. This car is very cvonfortable and does the job without spending a fortune.  The safety features, such ABS, save a fortune on insurance.  Behind the wheel, this car feels like a Porsche.  The leather on the wheel and shifter are a nice touch. For commuters, this is a nice car."
suzuki,forenza,2006,ric1000, 11/16/2005,My 4th Suzuki...another winner,4,"As a long time Suzuki owner, I would have been disappointed at anything less than a great value. I was not. The 2006 Suzuki Forenza reminded me why I bought my 2nd and 3rd Suzukis (and now my 4th). It has an excellent price, excellent reliability, all in a beautiful package. I am sure that this is not my last Suzuki."
suzuki,forenza,2006,melissa, 11/28/2005,I Love my Car,4,Since the day the dealer showed me my 2006 Suzuki Forenza I have loved it.  It gives me the feel of a much much more expensive car for less!  Everything from the handling to the stero I love.  The only complaint that I do have is not getting the crusie control and sunroof :( .
suzuki,forenza,2006,LMR, 02/15/2006,My First Suzuki and Maybe Not the Last,4,"the Suzuki Forenza is a lot like a Toyota Corolla or a Honda Civic without the high price tag.  It has a great warranty, although I haven't had to use it! :-)  It is roomy, gas-efficient, and has a nicely appointed interior.  The trunk is deceptively large and the 40/60 split on the rear seats is very convenient.  This car is very practical, but not very ""sexy.""  I would buy another one."
suzuki,forenza,2006,petert, 04/15/2006,Happy Forenza owner,5,"I purchased my Forenza 12/28/05. I have almost 9,000 miles and love the new car! I have the 5-speed which gives it a little extra pep when needed. I travel to Atlanta a lot - this used to take me 1.5 tanks of gas in my old car - I now drive door to door approximately 390 miles with gas left over to get around town! The most mileage I have gotten to the tank was 422 miles - I think I could have pressed it a little further but my E light had been on so I didnt want to take any chances. I had my first tune up @ 7,500 miles - an oil change, tire rotation, etc. cost $22 only.  So far I have nothing but good things to say about my Forenza. I have recommended it to my family and friends."
suzuki,forenza,2006,veaja, 05/01/2006,Love this car,5,We just got our Forenza wagon. We love it.  It has room for our family.  The stereo system is great. We travel on the weekends to ball tournaments and it hold all my sons ball stuff. Drive like a dream.  It has lots of extras for not a lot of money. I would buy one all over again.
suzuki,forenza,2006,Kaley Blesse, 05/17/2006,This is a Great Car!,5,This is a great looking car and it drives wonderfully. I drive about 40 minutes to work everyday and it's great on gas! The only thing that I can say I don't like about this car is the size of the tires.  No one carries this size tire that makes it inconvenient to find replacements.  I had two flat tires in one week. But otherwise this is a great car!
suzuki,forenza,2006,Rachel, 05/17/2006,Forenza #1,5,"Well I just recently bought a Suzuki Forenza, and I love it!  It is fast, roomy, has tons of features, and the best part is it is affordable. I just want to let people know that I am greatly satisfied with it. People always come up to me and ask what Im driving.  When I tell them, they cant believe its a Suzuki. Your competitors are charging thousands more than Suzuki, and for what? Words can not explain how satisfied my family and I are!"
suzuki,forenza,2006,michael n, 07/19/2006,Lots off Car for the Buck,5,"I purchased this car with iffy credit and the need for a good car at a good price.  It is quite lovely inside and out.  It drives acceptably, although not remarkably.  I have enjoyed it thus far."
suzuki,forenza,2006,mark, 07/30/2006,2006 Suzuki Forenza,4,My car gets me where I need to go. Forenzas and other Suzuki cars can be had at a more than reasonable price with no haggling.
suzuki,forenza,2006,onesorrysuzukiowner, 07/30/2006,Do Not Buy!,2,"Living on a tight budget and needing a new car, I selected the 2006 Suzuki Forenza.  I bought this car new with only 63 miles on it.  After owning it for three days I have had rough idling / no start problems, the engine intermittingly trying to die while driving, and warning lights that appear then disappear.  Please think twice before buying this car. I have had to get spark plugs and my new car's computer replaced only now to find out there is a glitch in the software program that downloads data into the car's computer.  The company says that there is no fix for my car yet I have had to be the one to DEMAND a refund.  I have had to get a rental and pay for their costly insurance . This car is no value for the money.  Please be wary of this car!"
suzuki,forenza,2006,Juan G Lozada, 09/20/2006,"Suzuki, More Bang for your Buck!",5,"My Forenza has is not only worth every dollar I paid for it, but it tops any Toyota or Honda in its class. We are a family of five and fit comfortabilly and there is space for my daughters wheelchair and luggage. The gas mileage is great, compared to the Toyota I used to have, and is as reliable as the Nissan and Honda we had. If you want more bang for your buck any Suzuki model is worth every cent. I was also an owner of a 2002 XL-7 when I lived in Puerto Rico and with bad roads and weather conditions, I felt super safe and it was fun to drive."
suzuki,forenza,2006,valerie, 10/08/2006,Car Has a Hard Time Starting!,2,I bought my car brand new in June of this year and it has been in and out of the shop for 53 days. They have put new spark plugs and a new computer and it still dion't want to work. I have been just getting the run around fron Suzuki and my dealership.
suzuki,forenza,2006,kevin, 11/16/2006,Suzuki Forenza,2,"I bought this car for work.  I drive 134 miles per day to and from work.  This car is not roomy enough and does not get very good gas millage on open highway.  At 70 miles per hour I average just under 27 miles per gallon.  My driving is all highway, with only 4 lights each way.  I am not very happy with this performance, but the dealership says it is within the specs."
suzuki,forenza,2006,not decided, 12/01/2006,Learning to Like,2,"I went from a luxury Toyota to an economy Suzuki. Except for power seats and a premium stereo I have the same features. The ride is adequate. My insurance is cheaper. The warranty is great.  It's an inexpensive car with a lot of the little options that we have come to want. It has tons of storage, and I had an SUV before."
suzuki,forenza,2006,mark, 12/05/2006,Not Too Bad,4,"I purchased this car new in Sept. '06. I have already put 5,000 miles on it and have not had any major problems. The air bag warning light came on and it turned out to be a wire connection in the driver's seat was loose.  Next was the check engine light, that one turned out to be the gas cap not sealing properly. As far as the gas mileage goes, I have found that if I use a higher octane 91 or greater the fuel mileage improves. 87 octane is just no good in this car. I drove mine from San Diego to Texas and back and found I was getting about 360+ miles per tank with 91+ octane as opposed to about 300 to 325 mi on 87 octane fuel."
suzuki,forenza,2006,Geni, 01/10/2007,"#1 Car in its Class in the in US, Hands Down",5,"I bought this car having had great experiences with Suzuki in the past. I was the owner of a 1986 Forsa in Puerto Rico until 2005. The three cylinder wagon was all I payed for it. This new Forenza is just as good. It is as fast as any Honda, Toyota, Mazda, Nissan and it is economically super. I have so much fun driving it, too bad it's so under rated. It's worth every buck I payed for it. "
suzuki,forenza,2006,mike, 03/15/2007,Great Car for the Money,4,"I love this car.  I got it dressed out for $13,300.  It is a well thought out car that looks great and I haven't had anything go bad."
suzuki,forenza,2006,hoogie, 03/29/2007,"Good car, low price for options provided",4,"This has been a reasonable economy car for the money. I did experience an occassional unnerving vibration until the tires broke in. Both headlights went out at the exact same time at 20,000 miles. Replaced those with no more problems. The car is an econobox so don't expect Honda/Toyota handling and performance. The features are good but don't expect to easily fit and aftermarket stereo or speakers in the car. It was a pain, trust me. Overall you get what you pay for."
suzuki,forenza,2006,lory conover, 04/07/2007,You get what you pay for,2,"At two weeks after purchase, the dash light switch went out. One month later the door locks stopped working. At 4 mo. the transmission went out. Was replaced by a new one, but now I'm concerned about the overall quality of the car. Looking to trade it in for a more reliable model. Darn. I liked the feel of the Forenza and the interior as well as fuel economy. Suzuki should stick with building motorcycles!"
suzuki,forenza,2006,Jeckaroonie, 04/29/2007,Strong purchase,4,"The car is perfect for its price range, although I do have a few problems with it.  The 3rd day I bought it, the check engine light went on, and when we took it in we learned the O2 sensor blew.  However, it was covered by the spectacular warranty.  Also the transmission is slow to respond.  When you go from R to D or D to R the transmission jumps.  The gas mileage is OK, I average 24 mpg.  For my small body (5'5"") I fit just great, however, my husbands 6' 5"" body has a tight squeeze.  I have the base model and I don't feel like I am missing out on anything."
suzuki,forenza,2006,voicetrack, 06/25/2007,Best Value,4,"I've owned this car for just over 6 months and haven't had a single mechanical issue. A seatbelt latch broke and the dealership fixed it under warranty in just a few minutes. The gas mileage is excellent, the performance is adequate. The interior is quite roomy, and visibility is great. The controls are conveniently located. I love the heated mirrors. I don't usually buy new cars, but the long warranty convinced me. This is a great car for the money."

At the time they didn't have a fix but a few months down the road a software update came out and that fixed the problem. I have had the car for a year and that is the only problem I have ever had with it. Right now I have put 20,000 miles on it. "
suzuki,forenza,2006,hazeleyes1918, 10/12/2007,Hmmm...,3,"I have only had this car for a couple months. 2 days after purchase it didn't want to start. They fixed the problem. There was a recall with the programming. Also when coming to a stop the brakes act funny. They almost give out like there is air in the line. They didn't check it, they just replaced the brake master cylinder. Also it sounds like my left rear brake sensor is chirping. Gotta take it in again. And my lumbar support on the driver seat broke. They had to replace that as well. I love the car but this is ridiculous! There is just over 16K miles on it and it is acting up already!"
suzuki,forenza,2006,suzukirocks, 06/09/2007,"WOW! Don't wait, BUY ONE!",4,"Second time Suzuki owner (Vitara) and have fallen in love with my new one! I have around 15k on my Suzuki Forenza sedan. The 5 speed tranny is easy to use and I especially like how you can't accidently put it into reverse. I am a large 6'1"" man and fit into this car without a problem. The engine is peppy and the fuel economy is fine. The car has a luxury car ride feel especially on long trips not typical of cars this size. Trunk is large. Getting a car seat in and out is easy. We can even get 4 people in this car with one in! 8 speaker stereo literally ROCKS! Power windows, locks, tilt, and power sides for this price. What a deal!"
suzuki,forenza,2006,Trenlor, 10/22/2007,Very Nice,4,"We walked in the dealership and told them what we wanted to pay and BAM... They showed us Suzi ;) Super nice for the price. We paid $8,999 with 26k on it. Runs like a top. Gas mileage for a so called econo car is pretty bad. We get about 23 MPG with 87 octane. But, that's ok! We love the interior to this car. Very sharp looking. People say it's noisy in other reviews and I can tell you that this car is quiet!! Maybe they drive on gravel roads and go 4 wheeling.  Driving this car is an absolute pleasure!! Handles nice but does have some sway to it. Drive like a human and this car will treat you right. Overall we love this car. Super features for the price. "
suzuki,forenza,2006,Karen, 10/16/2007,Good Value,4,"I bought my 2006 Forenza as a 2nd car but in a week, it became my only car.  I love this car.  It is a great value for the money, looks good and is easy to drive.  I wanted to buy an automatic but decided to stay with a stick since this is the only type of car I have owned.  I choose to have leather interior installed and really think that I paid too much for my car.  The gas mileage could be better but I was so glad to have a new car, it doesn't matter.  My friends say that there is lots of leg room.  This car rates high on my list as an economical investment for the money."

Drive these cars about 4,000 miles a month, under extreme conditions, snow, ice, desert heat, rough two lane roads, speeds of 85-90 for extended times and short bursts, high altitude always at least a mile.  Have had several problems starting, but just kept trying and now problem has resolved on its own.  Increased air intake with filter and exhaust... mileage about 31 hwy, not that great, hold button feature works well for steep grades and getting up to speed. excellent car so far, no problems needing service, passes extreme x2 test with 96"
suzuki,forenza,2006,nafeeshap, 05/01/2012,I got duped!!,1,"This car is the WORST car I have EVER owned. I drive a 2006 Suzuki Forenza. My car does NOT start like it is supposed to. I have spent so much money trying to determine what the problem is. I have to unplug the battery in order for the car to start when i'm ready to drive it & that does not always work. The car is in the shop right now. I took the car in Saturday 4/21/2012. I got a complete tune-up. I picked the car up Saturday 4/28/2012. I drove home. I parked the car. I went to move the car on Monday 4/30/2012. The car would not start. I took it back to the mechanic.
I brought the car with 4 miles on it. It was brand new. I now have 21,000+ mi on it. It makes no sense. I HATE this car!"
suzuki,forenza,2006,Uni, 02/24/2016,"If you can get a deal, go for it",3,"If you're paying a lot for this car, I really wouldn't recommend purchasing it. I've already replaced the TRS 3 times and it's really annoying to deal with. The plus is that you can still drive with the wonky TRS but it's uncool when you're going up a hill and it kicks into a different gear. So you go really slooow. Another thing is that the door handles suck and are really weak. I've had my two indoor backseat handles break off and those ironically cost more to fix than the actual TRS.

Other than this bs this car has been really trusty with no other issues. Which is good, because it already has a constant and unavoidable TRS problem. If you can put up with paying 300$ every year for a new TRS than this car is fine for you. Otherwise wouldn't recommend it. Not even for a new driver because what kind of teen has that kind of money to dish out?

suzuki,forenza,2006,Pat Hillyer, 04/27/2008,Hunk of Junk,3,It has ten thousand miles. It started not starting correctly at 4 thousand. At ten thousand just quit entirely. They put in nes software. That lasted one day. Then it would not start again.It has been  the shop a week and while I am paying $300 a month---I can ride the bus. Would I buy another? No. Would I take another as a gift--doubt it. The only good thing is the guarantee Te rest is a hunk of junk
suzuki,forenza,2006,bb4t, 11/10/2011,"Wow, lots of bad reviews here",4,"After driving it for a week, the clutch plate was slipping according to them so they fix it for free of course. Since then, the car has been great. I now have 95,000 miles and I literally have done nothing to it expect oil changes! My battery lasted until 94,000 miles! Sure I have issues...need rear shocks replaced, leaking a little antifreeze but hey, I ain't paying for it if I don't need to. I actually prefer a small antifreeze leak, it saves me from spending hundreds of dollars flushing the system. I love driving this car with a manual. Those of you burning through tires, I do too but that's bc I like driving rough. You can get different tires with more tread if you're concerned."
suzuki,forenza,2006,floyd93, 10/04/2011,JUNK,1,"The rest of the reviews pretty much cover it, but so you don't think 'maybe there are just a few bad ones' let me add my 2 cents, 1 cent more than I would pay for another Suzuki! This thing will rip through brakes and tires faster than I thought possible. Had a transmission issue at less than 30,000 miles that some how was not covered under their great warranty. Don't even bother with their customer relations department, that is a joke in itself. Another Transmission problem at 70,000 miles, oh this was covered by the warranty but somehow the radiator needed to be replaced at the end of the service. Don't ask me???"

My wife's Forenza has the check engine light on now. The code presented were PO700and PO705 (Transmission Range Sensor) This part is dealer only and cost $50-$60. Getting it fixed at the dealer would have cost us about $300-$400. $60 part, thirty minute change time, $400 cost. Yeah right! Did it myself."

At first it ran great, but once it started hitting the 60k mark, I have had problem after problem. First it was the door handles breaking, then the tire pressure light, then the passenger air bag light went off, then i got my gear shift fixed, then my timing belt broke off, then a new engine, then i needed new shocks and new struts, then something with my tires wearing down , and now my transmission is having trouble. I wish i would have known about this car before i bought it."
suzuki,forenza,2007,jackie_o, 08/31/2013,Regularly Check for a Recall,2,"In one sense, I love my car.
Because it is my car, and it looks okay.
But that's where my affection for the Suzuki ends.
I bought this in 2008 from Carmax with 10,000 miles on it.
Within one week the transmission slipped and I learned about the faulty sensor.
It was replaced.
Resurfaced 2 mos. later, so it was reset.
And again, and again. Have dealt w/ the ""check engine"" light and transmission slip for 5 years.
No one has the answer nor can they fix it except temporarily.
It's ridiculous.
I keep expecting to see a recall to no avail.
Also:
Shoddy paint /
flaking wheel cover.
Cracked pillar trim (I often see this on passing Forenzas).
Awful. Be not tempted by the price."
suzuki,forenza,2007,julie, 01/14/2016,Hunk of Junk (but I've been lucky),3,"I got my 2007 Suzuki Forenza at Carmax in the summer of 2008. It had 5,000 miles on it. At first, it was a reliable car. 
When I hit 40,000 miles that's when the trouble started. The transmission started slipping. The transmission sensor went out and I had it worked on. They didn't fix the problem. There's no Suzuki dealership nearby me so Ford took over their issues. They have attempted to fix the transmission censor twice. It still slips. There's a useless ""hold"" button that I think may be part of the cause of this. 
The paint peeled off the door handles. (I've been lucky enough to not have a door handle break). The paint peeled off the bumper so badly that I took it to the car wash and blasted the paint completely off the entire bumper. It looks better black than peeling paint. 
Wheels warped. Windshield wipers decide when they want to work now and when they don't. 
At 72,000 miles I had to have the motor replaced. The head was cracked. I'm convinced that the dealership did NOT replace the motor (as they claimed). The head is cracked again and now they say the car is ""too old"" to replace the motor they said they just put in the car 2 years ago. If this were a ""new"" motor,  then why won't they stand behind it? 
I have to drive this car like I am driving a stick shift, even though it's an automatic transmission. It acts like its in neutral when I put it in drive. I have to start out in 2nd gear. Always. 
This car did not get that hot for the head to crack. The only way I even knew that it was overheating was when my boyfriend noticed that the temperature needle was on H. It only steamed. Did not boil. 
The seat belt latch on the driver side is broken. The passenger side is getting difficult to snap shut now. 
This car chews up tires. It has no takeoff power now. Lately,  I've just been pouring antifreeze in it every other day. The replacement parts are outrageously expensive for this cheap car. I refuse to take it very far, and when I do drive it, I worry and pray. 
This car has 95,4000 miles on it now. (That's why I consider myself llucky). It sounds like a John Deere tractor.  
Thank the good Lord above I'm going to get another car next week!  Since this car has no resale value,  and isn't worth anything anyway, I will have to sell it to some poor Suzuki owner that needs it for replacement parts. 
I bought this car for the ""wonderful gas mileage"". HA! Not so great on gas after all. 
The best thing about this car is the seats are comfortable and it has a lot of room to be a small car.

suzuki,forenza,2007,Briana, 05/17/2016,An expensive piece of junk,2,"I bought this 2007 Suzuki Forezna used for about $6,000 in 2011 with about 66k miles on it.  I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on every expensive repair you can imagine.  The car has been regularly breaking down and in and out of the shop once every 3 months or so.  In the past 6 months alone, I have spent over $1500 replacing serpentine belt, spark plugs, engine valve cover, alternator, and radiator.  Even after all these repairs car is non-driveable, now being diagnosed with a blown head gasket. Also the cadillidic converter is bad. Time for the junk yard, and car is only at 109,000!   Terrible fuel economy, terrible driving (very sluggish), slow breaking, heat and cooling system inside vehicle stopped functioning properly years ago.    I only drive this car 5 miles to work each day, mind you, at the speed limit.  What an awful vehicle.  And awful resale value, even if it was in perfect condition (blue book value of less than $1,500).

I have pretty much each and every problem mentioned on other reviews. I have spend numberous amounts of money, time, missed work and tears... Why has there been no recalls or class actions suits. car in shop now after $1,700 in the last 3 months. Wont pass inspection and noone can fix. I am still paying of my loan.. so sad. "
suzuki,forenza,2007,dontbuyforenza, 03/13/2011,DisSatisfied,1,"It makes me sick to my stomach to read all the reviews on the Suzuki Forenza. It is sad that there are so many problems and no recalls. I have a 2007 Forenza & have had multiple issues. Tires are always in need of balancing, the door handles paint is starting to chip off, oil changes once a month because the oil light comes on and the engine knocks really hard even though there is plenty of oil, now as of yesterday, while I was driving, the trasnmission hit hard and the check engine light came on. The gear indicator flashes with a square with a line through it. I also almost got into an accident. Pep Boys ran the codes and as of many many other Forenza drivers, 7000 & 7005 came up. "

suzuki,forenza,2007,triniprinces76, 04/18/2011,Transmission and value,3,"I bought this car brand new back in September 2007.
I was desperate for a car, and it was all that I could afford. I should have resorted to taking the city bus!

Right around 60,000 the transmission started slipping, and the gears don't go in right away...

And if you're fed up of it, bull still making payments, don't try to trade it in.
It's worth NOTHING!


Lesson learned...I will stick to the cars that have been tested time and time again. "

suzuki,forenza,2007,Mariah Driggers, 10/14/2015,NEVER PURCHASE THIS VEHICLE,1,"This is by far the worst car ever. The transmission sensor doesn't work, it may at first but goes out in every single suzuki vehicle (check all reviews). The car locks go on and off while I am driving and makes a really loud noise and when I lock my doors it does it again and ends up leaving it un-locked I'm guessing thats another sensor out? The check engine light is always on. Not much of a gas saver to be honest. When you press on the gas it takes so long to kick off and makes a loud noise, when you shift gears it literally pops and the car shakes. The radio is not loud. Once I was on the interstate and my car just went into neutral, if a car was behind me it would have rammed into me. I have also been at stop lights and my car won't move because the sensor will think its in neutral. Never let a young adult drive this car they will not be safe!!!!!!! I fear of getting into an accident everyday.

My wife and I bought our car in 2007 and it has about 95000 miles on it now. We have had to replace the tires twice and two of the indoor door handles broke off, but that wasn't the cars fault, that was stupid peoples faults. We just had to put it in the shop and have to have a sensor replaced on the transmission, but besides that, it hasn't given us any problems."

The paint on the handles is gone but they are still attached atleast. We noticed the indicator light for the tire pressure was on and so when checking the tires on the car werent the right size but after reading the other posts i can see why.

suzuki,forenza,2007,BBowman0711, 12/19/2008,Good Car for Price,4,I like driving this car because it looks good and it's pretty roomy for a sedan. Going from a Corolla to this the extra room is amazing. Perfect for the baby car seat that I have to fit in the back. Not a problem with it so far and it's at about 25000 miles now.

suzuki,forenza,2007,csk17061, 08/19/2012,decent car for the money,3,"i bought this car new in 2007 to use as a work car. it currently has 128,000 miles on it. the car is made a bit cheap but
you get what you pay for. for under 10 grand new it was a great buy.
the only problems i had aside from basic maintenance is the interior door handles break easily but they are only 4 bucks to buy from a dealer and it takes 15 minutes to put it on.
it does seep oil out of the valve cover but again very easy and cheap to fix.
this is a picky car, but just like any car if you don't do the routine maintenance things will go wrong.

in short, the car is now 5 years old, still runs great and gets the same 32 MPG it did when i bought it."
suzuki,forenza,2007,hawtsauc3, 06/01/2013,Good Start Bad Finish,3,The negative reviews on this are pretty accurate. I bought mine in 2008 (it's a 2007) with 17500 miles on and it was great up until i paid it off. Over this last year it's slowly deteriorated along with a massively depreciated value. The negative reviews say between 60k and 100k miles problems start and lo-and behold on my day off yesterday the check engine came on the the transmission started acting up. Got the system re-set and was told it will probably break again. Traded it in today. It's a decent care for the price but once problems start its all downhill.

Edmunds says this vehicle has a loose handling system, NO, it has a McPhereson (one of the best) strut system up front, and multi-link in the rear with SSPS, being a test/pro driver for 2 years I find this suits the FF layout of this vehicle perfectly. Edmunds states all these strange 'facts' yet they have no road test review, nor do they have any proof that anyone even drove the thing! "

Well to date, no call yet that the seat is in and we are now in December and the car still rides like it has a hesitation.  Suzuki rep has decided not to return calls as well.

suzuki,forenza,2007,curt fletcher, 11/12/2010,Not bad at first,2,"If you notice reading all of these reviews, the recent ones are not good. All of the good reviews are from 2006-2007 when the car is fairly new with not a lot of miles on it.  Seems like once it hits the 50,000-60,000 mile range is when things start to go pretty rough.  Our front door handles broke off quite early, but they replaced them at the dealership no problem.  Just recently the transmission has been slipping and has almost caused a few accidents.  I've noticed the tires aren't the greatest either, seems like a pretty uncommon tire size, too.  Luckily the car is under warranty, so hopefully I can get the transmission problem fixed soon."

However I have had multiple starting problems with this car even though my Suzuki dealer claims this problem is limited to the '06 models.  It also gets bad gas mileage when compared to other compact cars.  I was driving a SUV so I did not notice it at first, but 21 mpg for a compact is bad.  Also, the automatic transmission sucks too much power away from the already small inefficient engine.  When I am going up a hill on the interstate I have to keep my foot on the floor and still lose speed.  The engine is also quite noisy and does not like to go above 60 mph.   Do not buy this car."

At that time, for some reason the service tech did not know how to get our car out of gear and a spring was broke in our gear shift.  We got that fixed.  Now, two days ago, I was driving to work and the car slipped out of gear by itself and went into neutral.  I immediately took it back to the dealer and they put a transmission relay switch? on it.  Within the last month, I have had the car at the dealer's 3 times.  Not very satisfied with this car at this time.  Would never buy another one.  "
suzuki,forenza,2007,David, 08/20/2009,Good Buy,4,"I will have to say that despite all of the negative reviews on the gas milleage, mine does great. I usually get 25 mpg which is a giant step up from a SUV that only got 16-17 mpg. I mainly drive city too.  The car is inexpensive b/c that's how it was built. So naturally there are downsides to it. The one I hate the most is the paint wearing out on most everything on the interior. It just would have been better to leave it the grey or tan plastic colors undernear. There is one more thing I don't like --  whenever I start it up and immediately shift gears, it will ""jump"" really quick and then will return to normal.  Other than the above complaints, it's been a great car so far."

If you are looking into buying a car like this, my best advise to you would be dont buy it.  P.S. Tires are ridiculously hard to find and are very expensive!"
suzuki,forenza,2007,unhappy with car, 09/14/2009,Transmission,2,"So, bought the car in Aug 2007, first month it was in shop 3 times for a vibration/shake.  They finally after first aligning, rotating and balancing tires, then supposedly replaced tires because they claimed there were flat spots figured out it was bent wheel axles!! Then again in the shop 3 weeks ago as the engine seemed to have a strain on it and then wouldn't drive. They claimed it was the sensor in the transmission, then got it from the dealer and that same day they had to have it towed as it would not shift into gear at all!!  They told me they replaced the shifter cables.  On the first time into the shop for the transmission they told me the radiator was never bolted into the car!!"
suzuki,forenza,2007,doggett, 09/22/2009,door handles break,4,"I love this car EXCEPT that the door handles have broken 3 times!!! And, the paint on my door handles is peeling off!  We bought this 2007 model in 2008 with a new full warranty, so the door handles have been replaced for free each time. But, it is a pain to schedule and appointment to have it done. Also, I feel like the dealership thinks I'm crazy and that I am actually abusing the door handles and breaking them. But, I am paying the bill each month and I expect it to work properly. I must say I am very happy with this car- especially the air conditioning, speed and gas mileage. I was worth every penny!!"
suzuki,forenza,2007,ang, 10/06/2009,Piece of Junk,2,I bought this car new. Since then I had to have my passenger door painted.  My windshield wipers are rusted my rear view mirror always has a vibration. Also like many others I had a door handle break. Now every time I drive my car looses the gas my car looses speed. Now it has a leak under the engine as well. This is very unsafe and of course they tell my nothing is wrong with my car.  Not reliabe and not safe.  Worst car ever I will never buy another Suzuki.  Don't waste your money no wonder they don't make these cars anymore.
suzuki,forenza,2007,clarissa , 10/19/2009,mad as hell,2,"as of 10/19/09 I have taken this vehicle to the dealer at least 6 times. it lights up like a christmas tree inside the dash board. check engine light, steering wheel, tire monitor all stay lit up and dealer can't seem to find the problem. I quess what they say, you pay for what you get is true, the forenza is cheap and is not worth the aggravation that comes with this car. I would not advise anyone to purchase this car, or you will be mad as hell the way that I am."
suzuki,forenza,2007,Crystal, 10/18/2009,Everything Breaking,1,"I've had my 2007 suzuki forenza for a year and a half, since then,3 of my door handles have broke off, which i had to pay to replace, said they weren't under warranty, my transmission is slipping from drive to neutral,about wrecked the other day, going into shop on monday, paint came off all 4 wheels during a paid car wash, they said not under warranty, as they said transmission not under warranty as well, i bought this car with the feeling of not being broke down for a long time, i still owe 9,800 on it,  I have taken extremely good care of my car, but it was so cheaply made its unreal, I feel suzuki should pay for the replacements of these parts, i would never recommand this car toanyone"
suzuki,forenza,2007,D, 01/29/2010,...,2,"I bought this car new over 2 years ago, have 61K miles on it. its a base model with a manual trans. only problem i have had was bent rims, and check engine light for throttle sensor (unplugged and replugged sensor and was fixed). I get 28-30 MPG on average. I haven't had any real troubles, dont have any real complaints on my car except for dealers (all suzuki dealers are nightmares) the interior is not great but haven't had anything brake, transmission isnt great but dose its job just fine. never had an engine problem, or any of the problems most other people seem to have and i tend to abuse my car. "
suzuki,forenza,2007,Angie, 03/02/2010,Cheap car,3,"Bought the car in 2007, I Had the transmission fault issue, the door handle issue, the paint on the wheels issue, the seat belt recall issue. the acceleration issue. Now I am buying my second set of tires, why put these expensive tires on this cheaply built car? It does get me from point A to point B, I do feel safe. "
suzuki,forenza,2007,marline, 03/06/2010,scared to depend,2,"I bought this car so that I would be able to go home when I wanted to. 4 hour drive. Now I'm afraid to go that far. Transmission sensor was just replaced today, still feel a small hiccup though. Not sure what that was. Tires were defective when I purchased the car, but the dealership says that there's nothing wrong with them. Started shaking at 60 mph a month ago I was informed that car was just out of line. I have to admit though, my dealership is awesome about getting it in and getting it fixed. I just Wonder when they'll get tired of it. Oh back door just started sticking as well. No one uses that door. Hmm! Does anyone else pay higher insurance because of the safety rating on this car."
suzuki,forenza,2007,H, 03/21/2010,I love this car!,3,"Very fun to drive - zippy, handles well, good pick up, small turn radius, parks easily. Great entry-level vehicle. Only disappointment has been gas mileage. I expected low 30's combined city/hwy, but getting only mid/high 20's. Bought mine brand new - last one on the lot, I have almost 18,000 miles on it - it's been great. Kids can get in and out easily, huge trunk fits baseball and lacrosse bags easily. Drives Colorado mountains with ease. Radio/CD player is OK - it's what's expected in this type of vehicle. Comfort is average. Although I sprayed Scotchguard on the interior myself, interior cleans up easily."
suzuki,forenza,2007,dwebb28, 04/14/2010,Don't purchase,2,"Transmission knocks when it is put in drive (just not when at the dealership), inside door handles break off, my valve cover gasket was leaking, my hood keeps popping open when driving, I keep going through tires after numerous alignments and rotations, and during an oil change when the vehicle was coming down off the lift the struts magically failed. Not a very impressive car. I do not recommend buying this car. Biggest mistake that I have made, should have spent a little more money on a Honda"
suzuki,forenza,2007,Cara, 06/10/2010,Never again!,2,"I bought my car brand new and It goes through tires and rimes like crazy, the passenger airbag sensor went out (2000.00 part) a .75 cent spring in console cost me 200 to fix, now the Transmission range sensor is going out.  They really need more recalls on this car but no one seems to care until the problems start to leave dead bodies on the road, hint (Toyota), back door handles are pealing, i would never buy one again.  thinking about having a bomb fire with it, at least than it wouldn't fail me!"
suzuki,forenza,2007,Richard, 07/20/2010,Great Car,3,"After 55,000 miles We have no issues. Did bend a rim on a deep pothole once. This is a nice, good handling little care. The gas mileage could be better than the 22 we are getting."
suzuki,forenza,2007,Kerry, 07/25/2010,This Car has been Good to Me,4,"Yes, this is a cheap car, but I paid a cheap price. I got what I paid for.  Never a break down, always reliable, NO problems at all and I have driven this car hard since Nov 2006 when I bought brand new. I didn't' know there was a recall on seat belts, was not notified. Guess I should check on that. I have never had one single problem. Not sure why everyone else is."
suzuki,forenza,2007,Sherrie, 07/30/2010,Get rid of it,2,"I was doing quite nicely with this car for about 1.5 years.  Then the transmission started slipping.  Dealer did diagnostic, found nothing.  No Check Engine light ever came on.  They unplugged battery to reset computer. Didn't work. Said was Transmission Range Sensor probably.  So I bought the part for $60.  Had a mechanic friend put it in as dealer wanted $230.  Took 1/2 hour.  Ran fine for about 20 miles then it slipped out of Drive and won't go back in. It's been sitting in my driveway.  Dealer is clueless.  Suzuki won't talk to you.  I bought this car because it was in the cheapest price range I could afford at the time. I have learned my lesson.  My inside door handle broke too."
suzuki,forenza,2007,jody, 08/03/2010,I tired of it,3,"Door handles broke off, needs constant tire balance, rotation, alignments. Interior lights quit working, passenger seat airbag sensor quit working. Cig lighter quit working. Car is only 3 yrs old (Dec 2007 purchase date). Been through more tire and alignments in 3 yrs than I did in 10 yrs on my Chevy 1500 used to pull horse trailers and hauling hay and driving dirt road looking for a camping spot."
suzuki,forenza,2007,JC, 08/09/2010,Peice of S@#$,3,"I am also having transmission problems, door handle problems, and one i haven't seen on here is the brake lights are coming on randomly and staying on and killing my battery, I expect the brake switch is faulty, I'm thinking about just outing a master disconnect on the main battery cable and shutting it off when the car is not in use, sure cure any electrical pull Rather it is the brake switch or not!"
suzuki,forenza,2007,Stephanie, 08/09/2010,2007 Suzuki Forenza,3,"I have owned my 07 Suzuki Forenza for two and a half years and my transmission is having major problems and most likely needs to be replaced.  I did have a decent warranty at my time of purchase, but unfortunately my dealer went out of business.  I am still trying to figure out where to take my car to get warranty work done at no cost to me.  I am very frustrated with Suzuki in general."
suzuki,forenza,2007,zmama, 09/15/2010,Death Trap,3,"We purchased our Forenza in 2008.  A month later 3 interior door handles broke off.  Ever since we bought the car I have had to put air in the tires everyother day or so.  Cheap Tires.  Low Tire pressure signal constantly. Took car to dealership they replaced doorhandles, let me know about seatbelts, fixed those.  About a month ago my transmission started slipping.  Me and my daughter are in the vehicle all the time. The transmission trys to slip into another gear.  We have almost been in SEVERAL accidents because of this.  I say a prayer everytime we get in the car to make it to her school or the store safely. this care is NOT SAFE!!!!! "
suzuki,forenza,2007,Jenny, 10/26/2010,I wish I would have known o_O,2,"I wish I would have known that this car is the cheapest car there is! My SIL had this car (2004 version) and I really liked it. I asked about the reliability and heard it was good. Well, the only thing I had wrong with this car so far is the gear change. Knock on wood.  That's all. I drove this car from Lawrenceviile, GA to Houston, TX twice (so you get the ideal miles I put on this car). I only now use this car to and from work. The tire pressure is low for some reasons. I get what I paid for. Errgghh."
suzuki,forenza,2007,matt, 02/05/2007,Piece of Junk,1,"My '07 Forenza only starts when it wants to, the check engine light comes on all the time, and it has a very bad trade in value!  Say no to Suzuki!"
suzuki,forenza,2007,hjb6, 08/28/2011,Paint or clear coat peeling off,3,"My car has suddenly had a problem with the clear coat on the hood peeling off. There is an area about 18 inches wide and just keeps growing bigger. Looks horrible. The tire pressure light stays on now all the time. We've checked and adjusted the pressure over and over and can't get the light to go off. The check engine light came on today and Auto Zone said it's coming up with something about the cooling system, most likely the thermostat. I'm calling tomorrow to have it all
checked out. It's been ok otherwise, but we'll see."
suzuki,forenza,2007,Sammy Felix, 02/26/2007,Nice Car,4,So far I have had no problems with this car. Its drive is very smooth and comfortable.
suzuki,forenza,2007,benny, 03/20/2007,Fun Car,5,"Hey, I really love this car. I think it's awesome. I have not had any problems with it and I love taking curves fast and driving fast.  I only pay $200 a month for it and I put zero down also. It is not a bad car at all. If you go buy one, don't forget to ask for the $1,000 rebate.  It puts the car at less than $14,500 for the 2007 model. If you find a 2006 model you can get it for $13,500. I read the complaints that some have about the resale value.  Well you just bought a new car you can't expect to resell it for more...it's not house. The best thing to do is just hold on to it and have fun with it hey it does have a great warranty and it looks really good."
suzuki,forenza,2007,Jim Malkin, 03/09/2007,Good Wagon for the Money,4,"It's hard to find a company that isn't discontinuing its wagons in favor of some kind of crossover thing.  Suzuki still proudly offers them and I was pleasantly surprised with the price, standard features and styling."
suzuki,forenza,2007,pops, 03/22/2007,Good Inexpensive vehicle,4,"I have read reviews detailing problems with starting, fuel economy etc.. This has not been the case for me. Fuel economy is better than EPA est. and the car has been very reliable and comfortable. One of the best cars I have ever purchased. The fit an finish of the car are excellent."
suzuki,forenza,2007,lisa, 03/24/2007,Doing fine with me!,4,I love my Forenza! I have the '07 black/premium package with leather interior and spoiler. I haven't had any problems with it. If you are the type of driver who likes to zig-zag in and out of traffic this car is not for you because the acceleration speed is moderate. I was a little disapointed with the gas mileage at first but I now put mid-grade gas to get better mileage and ride. The good really outweighs the bad. You can't have luxury expectations when driving a economy car! This car is doing just fine for me 
suzuki,forenza,2007,boao2k2, 06/06/2007,Sporty Compact,4,"I just purchased my Forenza, and love the fact that it's a 5-speed manual.  I replaced the factory tires with the rims off my trade-in. Big leap for me from a 92 accord with 347,321 miles to a brand new Forenza with 54 miles. Love the car for the price. I looked into a newer model Honda (04,05,06) but they were just as pricey but without the warranty, so I chose the Forenza with the warranty. With the way I drive it'll be 10 years before I hit 100,000 miles. "
suzuki,forenza,2007,Dani, 09/10/2007,Love my Forenza!,5,"Just bought the car and love it!  Handles well with lots of get-up-and-go with my 5-speed manual. Really hugs the turns, clutch is a little soft though. Still haven't found the ""sweet spot"" for 1st - keep peeling out on accident if I'm not paying attention :-D And the gas mileage is excellent.  "
suzuki,forenza,2007,Kelly, 10/23/2007,Excellent Vehicle!!,4,"My boyfriend and I bought our Suzuki Forenza about a week ago and I love it! Although ours is a 2008, it's still similiar to the 2007. It's a great vehicle. The exterior design of the car is excellent, and the interior has more than enough room. We have two small children and we are both still young ourselves, so the exterior and interior fit our needs very well. It's a great vehicle and I would recommend it to anyone!"
suzuki,forenza,2007,mswillard, 04/13/2008,Good Value for the Price,3,"Overall this car is a good value for the money. We bought this car on functionality and overall price. We have been fairly pleased. The car performs more or less as promised.  Handling is good and power is ok. The mpg has been less than average in the city and better than average on the highway. The car get 15-16 in the city for us, but over 30 on the highway. We have had to take the car in 3 times in less than two years.  The orginal tires where horrible, felt like they were out of balance and this grew worse with time. Two times they checked the balance issue, stating it was a tire issue. This has been fixed with different tires. Also we have had a cold idle issue too. 16,000 mi."
suzuki,forenza,2007,justonemike, 05/04/2008,Bad mpg,4,Ive driven the Forenza now for 6000 miles and the mpg on it the last 3 months has been awful. 12mpg 3 tankfulls in a row(unacceptable) and that's city driving. Summer highway driving was ok (27-29) but if I were to buy it again I would get a manual tranny. Ive read it does better on the mpg. Other than that cars been ok. Power is enough for my needs. Just one issue with an engine light had it checked  when I went for oil change.
suzuki,forenza,2007,BB, 05/17/2008,2007 Suzuki Forenza,4,"I needed a car that was reliable and I didn't have to spend a fortune on. While browsing for a few days I came across this car that only had 8500 miles on it for $9980.  One reason for the price drop was they dealer took the stock rims off and replaced them with 15 inch black rims with hubcaps on them. That was alright with me though because I can always replace that.  My Forenza is a manual transmission and unlike what other reviews have said on some Forenzas mine accelerates perfectly fine. The one and only complaint so far that I have about this car is that if the tires pressure is not perfect I get a light on in the car because of the TPMS. Overall though, good car so far!"
suzuki,forenza,2007,Cole, 03/21/2017,"Honestly, can't complain.",4,"I purchased this vehicle with 114,000 miles on it and have currently put 156,000 miles on it. As I near my trade in time, I thought it was time for me to review this vehicle for future buyers! Now, when I purchased the vehicle from a buy here pay here place in Delaware last year it already had a transmission range senor issue (which is a constant problem I see on other reviews of the same.) After I got that issue fixed I haven't had any issues at all since! Car rides decent, gets decent mpg, and the interior even has a certain appeal to it. I smell something everytime heat is on and I'm parked but haven't seen what it is yet.

suzuki,forenza,2007,Alyssa, 08/27/2017,What was I thinking?!,2,"Before buying a car I decided a 4 door sedan was the best option for me. I did not however know where to start. If interested in buying this car, don't be. There is a lot of matience that comes with the type of car. I did purchase my car from a pay here buy here and I know it's not the greatest place to get one but as someone who is just starting to get started on establishing some credit it's hard to find somewhere to get a car. I saw this car I particular and I was very intrigued by it. It was my favorite color and it had great gas mileage and it would be a reliable car I was told. However the opposite is true. I have spent so much money into making this car driveable. So far I have had to replace normal wear and tear (tires and windshield wippers, etc.) I knew I would have to eventually. I did not think that I would have to spend so much though. I have since getting the car almost a year ago, replaced the engine, fuel pump, radiator and spark plugs. All in the matter of about 8 months. I had the car sitting from the first week I got it for 4 months because I could not drive it because of the fact that the engine pistons had bent inside of the engine. So in all I have only had the car for about 3 months out of the year because then it sat again because the radiator busted so I had to repair that.
Edit.... I now do not have the car and sold it to a shop to take it apart and use it for scraps. At the end, my ignition started to go as well. I would drive it in the neighborhood and all of a sudden the car would slam on the brakes by itself and then start going again without me pressing the gas or break. If I did try to press either, the car wouldn’t do anything. It became a danger to not only me but the cars around me as well as my family. I had no other option but to sell it to a shop because of the danger it could cause to many more people. It has been a year since I sold the car and I am so happy that I did because now I know that the buy here pay here place that I got it from did not know anything about the car and that they only wanted money. Please please please, if you are searching for a car for your teenager, that you look at official shops and make sure that the car is thoroughly checked out. Also get a different car, yes gas mileage was the best with this car and I only had to fill it up a few times a month, if I drove long distances, it is not worth the hassle. I also saw that my car had a ton of reviews for problems with it and I had almost all of them in the first 8 months of having the car. If that doesn’t tell you that it’s not safe, then I don’t know what will!

suzuki,forenza,2007,Derek B, 04/05/2019,Bought it new,5,"I bought My 2007 Suzuki Forenza brand new with 47 miles on it As a gift for my wife. It's been in the shop twice once for the A/C Compressor and the second time for the 5 speed shifter linkage...It only has 66k miles on it now and has been super reliable it still has the original Clutch in it. They all have tire issues..I went with a 195/60R that seemed to take care of the tire issues and for some reason the front carpet just deteriorated.. I think that's a common problem with 2007 Forenzas but it's an emergency backup car now..I use it to drive to my rig from time to time NO ISSUES FOR NOW (KNOCKONWOOD)..

suzuki,forenza,2007,JC in Colorado, 04/26/2019,Very reliable,4,"I have a 2007 Suzuki Forenza sedan. Bought it in late 07 had 3,000 miles on it. Very reliable car only have minor issues. The only thing is now the wiper does not work sometimes changed the motor still not fixed! It still drive and go really well."
suzuki,forenza,2007,Distantperpetual, 07/18/2019,Atrocious vehicle!! A terrible wasted investment,2,"I hardly ever write reviews, but I couldn't hold back on sharing my bad experiences of the car i tolerated for the past 5 years, I figured 'hell, I could help save someone from the pending doom this car will bring if purchased somewhere'.  Wow, so where do I begin? Well, for starters, the car was purchased with 135k miles on it and now has 193k. It was deemed as a reliable vehicle I'd use all through college perhaps even few more years after that. The amount of money that has went into this vehicle for repairs has surpassed the actual purchasing price on it till this day has repairs that still need to be done which will cost an arm and a leg. I can vividly recall the day I missed my pharmacy school interview all because this [non-permissible content removed] car decided to have it's timing belt break on the highway, which also caused internal damage to the engine and bent valves. Guess who missed a golden opportunity because of it? This repair alone costed me well over $1,000. That was just beginning of the many difficult times with this car. This car now has a blown head gasket and the transmission is going out. Suzuki as a company should be ashamed of themselves. Just to save you guys time heres just a small list of all the repairs i've done to the car;
1. transmission range sensor 
2. engine mount replacement 
3. water pump replacement 
4. Egr Valve 
5. Oxygen sensors 
6. Coolant reservoir 
7. Radiator replaced
8. windshield wipers.
etc...
 If you even have the slightest interest in this brand of vehicle, please RECONSIDER ASAP.

suzuki,forenza,2007,Blair , 06/03/2020,Too many issues,2,"I bought this car in 2008 brand new for 12,000 dollars, you get what you pay for. Once I hit 42,000 miles that's where the transmission issues started. Paint would chip on door handles, bought countless tires (lost count) windshield wipers stopped working. Plastic Door handles broke inside. The gas mileage was good, but once I hit 100,000 miles the car was not safe to drive anymore since you never knew if the car would start? I loved the model of the vehicle, affordable to purchase, but not a long term car to keep. I would buy it again since it did last me almost 6 years.

I even sleep in this wagon by pulling UP on the backseat bum cushion to remove it, allowing the back seats to fold almost flat.

suzuki,forenza,2008,Cherron White, 11/20/2015,Great for a Student/ or someone on a budget even,4,"I bought this car used at 90k miles, the only problems I had the first year was one of the headlights (easily fixed not a big issue), year two the car is now at 137k miles, I have only had to do the regular with this car occasional oil changes, one alignment (due to me), new tires ( because as I said I bought it used and the tires were pretty through). The most expensive issue I've had with this car was the alternator, which is not really expensive compared to other issues that could have arisen. As far as comfort this car is extremely roomy for someone who not too tall or too overweight, it's not made to be a family car in my opinion( for a big family at least...get an SUV or mini van if that's what you're looking for) However, I can comfortably fit five people in my car with enough space for everyone. The trunk space is perfect, and the interior space is as well granted I don't have a back seat full of car seats. When it comes to the sound system, I have the original still in mine because it sounds just fine.

I have gotten regular oil changes by a friend at his home of mine who used to own a shop for years. I have taken good care of the motor just blew out of nowhere. I got to school one morning and it just started knocking and now I have to spend 4k on a new engine! It is still under warranty but they want reciepts for oil changes when I got mine done for free. So basically im screwed even though the car was taken care of. Many other problems. headlights burned out, transmission slipping, windows not powering right, AC this summer(I fixed), bateries run out quick..... Just dont buy it!!!!!!!!!"

We think it will meet our needs nicely.  I am a big guy and I have plenty of room in this car. Nice interior, comfortable, looks great.

I'm upset that we missed the tax credit by 12 days or so but got a great price on the car ... around $12,000 new with only 8 miles on it. I can't say about the airbag issue that others mentioned but would be a concern. The gas mileage is fine for my family ... 10K average yearly miles, around 20 mpg. I mostly drive city. I would recommend the car to others. The car came loaded with air, CD, defroster, cruise, etc. We got a 6% interest rate through credit union because the purchase price had built in equity. Former car was a Hyundai Accent. I liked that one too. For me a car is transportation, not for status.  "
suzuki,forenza,2008,JJ, 06/06/2008,See for yourself,4,"I really can't say anything bad. One of the sharpest cars you can buy for the money. This car comes with great base model features and is much more solid than econo-cars before it. You don't buy these cars for sheer performance and gas prices should make the driver focus on doing his part, not just the car. With the money you save invest in a $99 mod-chip for even better mpg & hp. The mpg lives up to it's window-sticker quote which is more than a lot of cars can say! "

Every time I get the code read it's throttle body sensor. My mechanic called Suzuki to see about a part  They told him what makes you feel it's the throttle body. The mechanic told them the diagnostic test. They said I doubt it's that. Sent a part over in a used dirty bag wasn't even the right part.
11/14 had 2 throttle bodies out in something no one is catching is what causes these throttle body issues. Computer problems perhaps?? Since the car just stopped in the middle of the street leaving me stranded i give up.  Since I couldn't find anyone who can figure out why this car is using so many throttle bodies it just in my yard. Can't take the Chance I'll be stranded again.

It was shifting from one gear to the next unpredictably. When driven down hill it jumps into gears. When driven up hill it drags then jumps into gears  and will excelarate unpredictably. The mechanics in the Suzuki dealership told us the car will stop doing this after 6K miles that because it was new this was expected and normal. It is past the 6k mile point, we have about 12k miles on the car and we still have the same unpredictable shifting and excelaration I am not comfortable driving this car any more and am wondering why there hasnt been a reca"

To start, they replaced the transmission a day before I got it. Dealer never said anything and said nothing was wrong with it, that it belonged to an elderly woman who only used it to run errands... I get the car n 6 months later (4,000 miles if that!) they had to replace the transmission again! 35,000 miles currently n on its 3rd transmission and current will need replaced yet again cause its slipping.

Does anyone know what to do to get the engine light to go off and stay and the transmission to stop whacking out? I've been told it could be the transmission fluid but no local shop can do it cause it's a foreign car.

Practically the same spot on car, and location within her community; and neither time did the airbags deploy. How can you trust a car that isn't protecting you?!"

I feel like I am driving a manual transmission because it jerks pretty severely when you step on the gas.  I had to have my speakers replaced because they blew out - I don't blast my radio!  My fuses blew out on my cigarette lighters and turn signals within a year.  My engine light is on again, this time due to a bad transmission sensor! The gas mileage is horrible!

suzuki,forenza,2008,Vick, 09/12/2019,It's been a great car,4,"I have loved this car. I do wish it had a few more features like cruise control and alloy wheels but I am very satisfied. It has 5000 miles when I bought it in 2008 and I've only had 2 problems. I had to replace the oxygen sensor about 4 years ago and replace the valve cover gasket in 2019. It rides smooth but at some speeds like 60 mph it feels like the wheels need alignment buy when I hit 70 plus it goes back to a smooth ride.
Overall I am very satisfied that I bought this car. It had 2 minor recalls. I do have to say if I knew Suzuki Auto USA was leaving America I probably wouldn't have bought it but still it's been a good car. I'm not sure I selected the exact model to review ie: 4A ect."

suzuki,forenza,2008,Darren, 08/04/2019,Rough and Tumble,4,"I bought my little 2004 Suzuki Forenza for $1200 from a used car lot in 2014, with 163k miles and a wreck on the car fax, to give me a gas saver alternative to my 1978 GMC C1500. Bought this car knowing the water pump was out, and it would over heat if not driven carefully. Replaced the water pump and timing belt for $120 and changed it myself, and proceeded to be a typical young 20s driver and drove the absolute garbage out of it. I jumped railroad tracks, took it off road, took on the interstate at 100mph, raced friends and even towed a 1993 Ford F150 about 10 miles with it. I couldn't kill this car! I carried a jump pack with me after about 4 months because the ORIGINAL batter finally stopped holding a charge. 
Eventually, my negligence got the best of me, the transmission started slipping, which would have been fine except I passed somebody and lost 4th gear entirely, over revved the engine and blew the timing set. I mean there were pieces of cam gears all over the engine bay. Scrapped it for $86, towed, and called it a day. I just hope I gave that car a good swan song.

I luv the Hold button it makes the car go crazy giving you high acceleration. The only thing i hate is the left side mirror, alot of blind spots.. i had an A4 Skoda and the left side mirror showed me whole 3 lanes, the optra shows you only one & miss leading data on the cars position, some time i look at the left mirror & deside to change lanes and i find a car beside me!! i'd say its soo narrow, but all in all, i luv this car.Just dont fool your self, your not driving a benz.. what you pay for you find, no high expectations. Thats why i like it."

I owned a honda civic for 2 years prior to this, also 2008 sedan model and the forenza drives better.  My car payment went down 200 bucks!  Smoother ride and quiet.  I got 26mpg on my first gas tank.  Not bad city/highway.  If you are thinking of getting one of these cars, just get in it and drive.  You'll be sold!  11k for a new car, nuts!!!"

The air smells like mold whenever I turn the a/c or the heat on, me being pregnant doesn't help my tolerance level at all. The transmission is going out, shifts horribly, the driver side airbags do not work (the light is on 24/7) and the passenger side sensor doesn't work when it should. The cars only 2 years old has 40k miles, I cannot believe that there are this many problems with it so soon. Blown speakers, windows are off the tracks."

I use the car daily for a 33 mile commute. I am pleased with the gas mileage I get. I am averaging 29-30 mpg and my commute is includes mixed city/country driving. The car now has about 36,800 miles. A few things have required repair - two new rear struts, new drive belt on the engine and new valve gasket on the engine. All of these items were repaired at no cost to me under the warranty."

His girlfriend is 5'9"", neither of them could fit well in my Sebring. Acceleration is impressive for such a small car, and with the italian styling, I've had people ask me what type of car I'm driving. With a 100k 7 year warranty, I know I can drive this car for years without a worry. It's definitely worth consideration."
suzuki,forenza,2008,Ryan, 03/27/2008,Better value than Corolla or Civic,4,"The Forenza is the best value on the street. I have had two Civics and one Corolla and the Forenza tops them all. For what you pay for the Forenza you couldn't get a bone stock Civic. The Forenza comes with all power windows, a really good stereo, and a world class a/c. Suzuki has come along way from jet skis and motorcycles. With America's best warranty 7years/100,000, why wouldn't you go with the Forenza?"

I am a large person, and this is the first car I have owned where I could not slide the seat all the way back; it was too far from the wheel to be comfortable! It has all the extras I was looking for, has enough 'get-up-and-go' for my style of driving, and the controls are laid out nicely. I do think I will spend a few bucks and get some nicer wheels; the steel wheels w/hubcaps have got to go."

The gas does not justice, I had way better usage in my V6 Pontiac Grand Prix then this little 4 cylinder. I wish I would of taken better looks into it and not have let the warranty win me over cause now I want another car so bad and I don't want this car. "
suzuki,forenza,2008,David, 05/10/2008,Good for the price?,3,"I thought this car would be good on gas and boy was I wrong! The dealership said it would get better the more I drive it, but who wants to drive more than they have to with the price of gas as it is. I get about 325 to 360 miles per tankful, which averages about 25 to 28 mpg. I have the standard and when it is in 5th gear it sounds like it is going to take off. I think there should be an overdrive or sixth gear."
suzuki,forenza,2008,Tony, 05/23/2008,Fantasy Black Metallic,4,"I have just the basic model of the Forenza, but if you would just look at it you would not be able to tell. My car has chrome wheels on it and the rear spoiler. If you have a Forenza add the spoiler it will make your car look even better. I love my Forenza(Lucy), but having a car like mine you will get a lot of people who are hate on it. My car handles very well in heavy rain (change out the wipers and get the new air dynamic ones they work way better than the ones that come on the car). Why go get a basic Toyota or Honda with crank down windows when you can get a Forenza for about the same price and get all power stuff."

extensive research.  Thrilled initially:
 great performance, adequate gas
mileage, able to be loaded up with STUFF
and then coverts easily for passengers.
And, FUN TO DRIVE.  I began having
mechanical problems around 40,000 mi. 
Front axle seal came out of position
causing leakage--3X! (Very costly
repair)Finally, root cause is determined
to be ring and pinion.  Dealer and
Suzuki picks up cost.  3 months later,
another costly repair involving the air
conditioner.  Love this car, but I will
never buy another one.  Too many
problems.  Dealer service was EXCELLENT.

suzuki,grand-vitara,2001,Georgia, 10/20/2015,15 yrs of joy/ 18 yrs coming ☝,5,"I bought my SUV XL7 off the lot.  Brand new.  I had never had a new car before. I was 60 yrs old and I wanted a car that I could go anywhere with.  Camping, fishing, drive across country and not have to worry about breaking down in the middle of nowhere.  This Suzuki Grand Vitara XL 7 has  been wonderful!  It is getting a few exterior rattles but so am I.  A few dings.                 
 But all these yrs NOTHING has n needed to be replaced.   Although I did lose the ashtray (long story).  It is my pride and joy.  I'd never trade it in for a new one.  I'm happy and content with my 2001 Suzuki XL 7 Grand Vitara.  I just need to find a replacement ashtray.  humm?      UUpdate:  Ok, it's the end of 2017. Need new break discs.  But other than that ( and a grocery store ding) she is still going 💪. I'll be back again next year and I'm quite sure my Suzuki XL7 will be too.  Happy ☺driving 🚗!

suzuki,grand-vitara,2001,Jp, 08/10/2015,Great SUV for the money! Would buy another.,5,"I have had mine for over ten years.  No serious mechanical issues ever.  Replaced tires early on, now it goes through deep snow, sometimes past American 4 wheel drive trucks that are stuck.   Normal wear-out stuff replaced, wiper blades, battery, brakes, belts, hoses.  Gas mileage 20-25 mixed driving, 5 speed stick shift.  Car has burned a little oil since new.  Takes a quart every few thousand miles, so we just change the oil and filter.  A great car for family with small children.  Has been a real pleasure.

My dad and i replace some seals in the front and the leak stopped for a bit but then it comes back with a vengeance. When we go one drives just 10-15 miles down the road there will be small puddle of oil on the ground. Just a little annoying and i hope it doesnt lead to bigger problems. We are at 175,000 miles on it so i guess thats what we get for having it so long! :) Also, be caeful w/ the air conditioning. Ours went out and now to replace it will cost $$$$$$.

The only maintenance has been oil changes, windshield wipers and tires - it still has its original brakes, etc.  It did have one minor recall issue that was fixed easily by the dealership.  I have done some off-roading and felt very secure.  The back end is light, but add a couple of sand bags in the winter and it does great in 4WD.  It is a pleasure to drive on or off road."

The shift on the fly 4X4 with hi/low

the CRV and RAV4. The exterior is 
masculine and the interior is just 
right.

The V6 155 hp engine is quiet and

the hood latch is responsible for an

This car is a bit bumpy but the stiff suspension helps out when offroading.(needs more clearance though) My biggest complaint is the cheap plastic side panels.

There is plenty of trunk space but only if you put the back seats down.  Also the chrome hub caps that they used to come with should be put back on I had go to an after market dealer to get them.  Also living in Florida the windows are just too clear and the air conditioner cannot keep up with the heat that comes in through the standard windows so window tinting is a must down here.

suzuki,grand-vitara,2003,Mark, 05/06/2005,Value and then some,4,"I have owned my Grand Vit since Aug.2003. Bought it new w/only 60 (demo) miles on it.  I don't drive much ( that's why the LOW mileage after over 18 months.  I live in Syracuse, NY. We get lots of crappy weather including SNOW (measured in feet) during the winter months. One of the 'standard' features for this model is elect/defrost for the power mirrors. It also has electronic climate control for heat/AC and a Clarion sound system w/ subwoofer right under the driver's seat.  I think those clipboard toting snobs at JD Power are being way too techy/harsh.  This is an EXCELLENT VALUE for anyone wanting an SUV (4WD capable) with quite a few creature comforts- not a LEXUS but u can buy 2 Suzukis"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2003,Ted1161, 01/20/2004,Good bang for the buck,3,"Overall I am happy with the Suzuki.
Ride is on the hard side even for a 
SUV.  MPG average is 20... acceptable 
but could use more power... good for 
around town but NOT good on the 
highway as it needs constant steering 
input.  Make sure you get the front 
end alignment checked mine was out 
over 20 degrees..."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2003,Scott Tillson, 07/27/2006,The Best New Vehicle I've Ever Owned!,4,"I purchased my Geand Vitara new with 61 miles on it. I had to order from a place 45 miles away. I have had a great time in it. My 6 and 3 year olds have had lots of fun with us on the long trips from Norfolk, VA to Anniston, AL. We all were very comfortable the whole trip. If bad weather hit and we had to get out in it i just put it in 4x4 and had at it. I will never regret this purchase even if new cars depreciate quickly the moment that they are driven off the lot.  I really love this truck. My family does too!"

It is roomy and comfortable... with all rows of seats up there is not much cargo room, but then who travels with 6 pasengers.... The only fault I have found is that is eats gas like I do MacDonalds french fries... and on the highway it is somewhat noisy, however for the past 7 years I have driven a Honda Acord EX...so the comparisson is probably not fair...  It makes me feel young and sporty...didn't really need the 4 wheel drive...but now I have no excuse not to visit the kids in Utah and Idaho in the winter....  I love the 6 CD changer...and the interior is great... Ilove the fact that the rear door swings out. "

Solid construction."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2003,Peter from Montreal, 03/16/2003,Awesome Test Drive,4,"The 2003 GV is a great compact SUV, with 
plenty of power. Best power to weight ratio

Best price in its class. Ladder box frame. 
McPherson suspension. Value.
Don't overpay for a CRV, RAV4, Tribute, 
Santa Fe, Liberty, Xterra, Escape or Vue.
Best bang for the buck. Better interior than 
all of the above. Handles very nicely too.
GREAT PRICE $$$ !!!

Not suitable for families, serious towing or 
very long driving trips. Depreciates quickly. 
Requires rust proofing every year, or else 
may rust quickly. 
Sound system sucks. The wind noise gets 
loud at 120 km/h. The engine gets noisy at 
around 4000 RPM. ABS feels ""soggy"". "

I then bought a 1999 Isuzu Rodeo LS, which I hated.  I had lots of problems with it.  I regretted getting rid of my little Suzuki, so I decided on another Grand Vitara.  The level of refinement from 1999 to 2004 is amazing, and I'm happy to be back in a vehicle I have a lot of confidence in.  I read what owners say about this truck, I know my experiences with the vehicle, then I read the ""experts"" tests.  Well, the ""experts"" are nuts IMO.  They are worried about defrost button illumination, minor engine noise, etc.  You think that this truck gets poor gas mileage? Drive a V6 Rodeo around for awhile."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2004,MOdriver, 10/28/2010,Saved My Wife's Life,4,"We owned this little car for a year and a half. I took our 2WD through fields, used it to haul hundreds of pounds of landscaping material. Pulled a trailer with it off a tow loop, no trailer hitch. Through all this abuse this car always started up, ran straight, and pushed through everything. Its a tough little truck, tho underpowered for highway speeds. It has strength, but you'll be downshifting up hills and its not too soft about it. 2 weeks ago my wife swerved to miss a raccoon, flew off the road, flipped and rolled 6 times. The air bag deployed and this little car landed upright, my wife is alive along with two dogs. We just bought a new Suzuki to replace this one. Great Car!"

Rebates helped lower the cost a lot. It is fun to drive. I can zip wherever I want to go. It has great all around visibility. I couldn't see out the back of most of the other SUV's I test drove. This is something to think about if you have small children or grandchildren! The ""editors"" of car review magazines say it's not as good as other vehicles. But they don't tell you it's a heck of a lot cheaper, too! If they didn't get to use free cars and had to make payments, they'd consider this a good, inexpensive SUV that delivers fun to its drivers."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2004,F. LaRock, 06/02/2010,Great little vehicle,4,"I purchased my 2004 Grand Vitara LX in Feb 09 and is the first actual 4 wheel drive I've ever owned.  I have driven over 15,000 since Feb 09 with absolutely no problems.  Car was in excellent condition and I was the 2nd owner and received the remainder of the 7 yr/100K warranty.  Vehicle performs excellent here in the winter (U.P.of Michigan) and wouldn't trade it for the world. (Gotta put in a plug for Northway Auto in Rhinelander, WI.  Great no-pressure sales and very honest.  Had my vehicle in top condition at purchase; even replaced radio with brand new one,  replaced all brakes and discs and serpentine belt and produced all docs of proof.  Will definitely buy there again and will recommend."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2004,wade davis, 08/30/2004,suzuki gran vitara,4,"I purchased this vehicle mostly because 
I was able to get so much better deal 
than a honda, which i actually wanted.
I have to say now, after putting 20000 
miles on it in the last 6 months, I 
have never had a car I looked forward 
to driving as much as this one. I will 
buy another one of these, i can assure 
you of that. Oh, there might be some 
little things here and there I might 
change, but this is undoubtedly the 
most dependable vehicle I have ever 
owned.  Surely, this must be the best

money available."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2004,SMiller, 01/25/2004,Listen to this,5,"Unfortunately, Edmunds missed the boat 
on their review of this vehicle, a 
common occurrence among their 
reviewers. They consistently are 
abnormal compared with more admirable 
magazines. Anyone who drives the 
redesigned for 2003 hence 2004 Suzukis 
would realize the major leap in every 
aspect that Suzuki has made. Edmunds 
reviews always leave a lot to be 
desired when it comes to vehicle 
reviews, they almost seem as if a 
reviewer has been paid off to endorse a 
certain vehicle over others. When 
is comes to researching vehicles,  
there are superior choices to consider."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2004,Brian O, 01/06/2005,The Grand Vitara is GRAND,4,"After owning a 1995 Suzuki Sidekick, I 
was very pleased with the quality and 
capabilities of the Suzuki SUVs.   My 
Sidekick, which I refuse to sell now 
serves as my daily driver and offroad 
trail vehicle (extensively modified).  

The Grand Vitara took the sidekick 
platform and made an already great 
vehicle that much greater.  A more 
plush ride, major interior 
improvements and amenities, as well as 
a highly upgraded engine all make the 
Grand Vitara awesome.   

There are a plethora of other Mini 
SUVs out there.  What you won't find 
on about 80% of the others is a true 
4x4 (not AWD), a low range transfer 
case, and a body of frame.  If your 
travel offroad, get the Grand Vitara.  "

great, it's very easy to judge parking, 
has plenty of power and it is, for me, 
fun to drive.  It has all the amenities 
that, with maybe the exception of one 
or two, that I could possible want in a 
car.  I never owned a 4WD before and we 
had our first snow fall a few days ago 
and it worked great.  I have only two 
small complaints.  I'm a smoker and I 
am not crazy about where the ash tray 
is, and, while the engine produces heat 
quickly,  the interior takes a while to 
warm up.  That's it."

suzuki,grand-vitara,2004,Gord, 08/01/2020,Very tough and capable.,4,   True part-time 4 wheel drive traction and a very strong full frame. Short front and rear overhang means fantastic angle of attack. I purposely drove square into a ditch with steep sides and then was able to turn around in the (narrow) ditch and drive back out the same way. Try that with a long wheel base or long overhangs. Windows and door key locks tend to freeze up in sub freezing temps. Luckily I can still unlock with key fob. Hopefully you don't get one where the number 1 timing chain tensioner fails like I did...the part is not expensive but big labor cost to install. Might as well have a new water pump put in at the same time because that is also listed the same 14.4 hour job. Was able to do the job myself. Local dealer quoted $3000. I don't know how commonly that tensioner fails. Supposedly takes less time to change the engine. I still love it though. Fell in love with the cosmic blue and silver paint scheme when I first saw it.

There were several other accidents that weekend, and I saw many SUV's on the back of wreckers (large and small). My Suzuki was the only SUV that the roof hadn't completely collapsed or caved in at the front. The front corners of the roof came down about an inch, the windshield and driver-side window broke but stayed intact.

It cycles on and off at least 4 or 5 times per minute causing loss of power and erratic performace.  I am not happy at all with this vechicle and also with the support from Suzuki.  The dealer said it was ""normal"" and Suzuki said it was all up to the dealer.  A catch 22 situation.  Suzuki is of very little help when you call about a problem that the dealer will not address. Finally when i got the attention of the Service Manager he saw it was a problem and tried to correct it.  As of today it has not been corrected.

Its fuel enconomy is about 19.50 ~ 21.88 mpg in my area.  Mine is a great color (I have the blue bi-tone).  I suggest using Mobile 1 sythetic oil for motor oil, differential and automatic transmission for long lasting lift of vehicle. "

The Suzuki beats Toyota and Honda at their own game with this vehicle.  Its great standard features and really nice build quality won me over.

Most recently, I've been having engine troubles. My mechanic tells me that the throttle body has some kind of defect that makes it prone to getting clogged. As a result, my car won't start sometimes. My last Suzuki had a rear main seal leak at 55,000 miles. I should have learned my lesson then... At 78000 with this one; hope to get to 100000"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Sherwin, 12/10/2006,Our First Family SUV,4,"When we first test drove the Suzuki Grand Vitara, we could feel its intense power and handling. It was widely noticed with its hot sleek looks, and came with a 4 mode 4WD system that I only expected from top end vehicles. The 2006 model was the first to have the new looks. Recently we went through a blizzard and the SUV handled amazingly. No slipping or getting stuck in the snow."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,tyjames13, 02/17/2012,LOVE IT!!,4,"iv had my grand vitara for about a year now and im very happy i bought it. When i first bought it the headlights were dual but i bought new sylvania head lights and they work great. love the AWD love turning corners way to fast! engine looks and sound great. im always getting complements on how it looks as well. i take it off roading pretty frequently and she loves it. my grand vitara now has 65,000 miles on it and still runs like brand new! i also love the leather, heated seats and moon roof, makes driving my car more fun..i have had a couple cars before, a 2002 chevy trailblazer LTZ, a 2006 toyota highlander, a 2008 hyundia elantra and now my suzuki. i'm 19 years old and im in love with it"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Michael West, 12/14/2016,My Grand Vitara - The best - Long May You Run,5,"I bought my Grand Vitara new so I could break it in correctly. 10 years later it had 228,000 miles on it. I'm not kidding when I say it was the best car I've ever owned. It felt solid and was dependable. Very capable in snow. It helped save my parrot's life - I had to take her into the doctor's office during record snowfall and we made it. No major repairs. Just regular maintenance, be sure to keep fluids up especially the transmission transfer case and differential. The V6 engine is pretty fuel efficient if you keep the speed down to 55 or 60 mph. 23 mpg combined with mostly highway driving. I loved the design of the dash - major lights were white and blue, secondary controls in red. Very beautiful. The interior materials - dash and instrument panels where the radio is - are a step up from previous Suzuki's I've owned. My only complaint is with the CD Radio for the 2006 year. Plan on replacing it - the CD seems to break down quickly. If you replace it with a 2007 or newer CD player it will last. Great trivia - The Suzuki V6 engine is also used as an aircraft engine - for a 3/4 scale P-51 Mustang WWII reissue. Suzuki also helped design the Saturn Vue. I had to sell my GV because I am going on a long trip to Arizona and I needed something with less miles. My replacement car, a Mazda CX5 is nice but it doesn't have the feel of my GV. If Suzuki comes back to the U.S., I will be one of their first customers.

suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Rey, 07/11/2010,Has held up well,4,"Have owned my GV since October, 2005. It now has 52,000 miles. So far have only replaced front brake pads once, power steering idler pulley (under recall), oil changes, coolant, wiper blades, headlight bulbs (twice) and a new set of tires at 40,000 mi. The vehicle has been trouble free minus the recall above. I have no real complaints with reliability/durability. Wish fuel mileage were better. Has held up quite well. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Sandra Andrade, 10/12/2010,Disappointed,4,"Loved my Grand Vitara when I bought it new.  Now have 65K+ miles on it, have replaced a headlight bulb, dome bulb has burned out, replaced tires at 40K miles, 3 recalls, and recently power steering rack had to be replaced.  Had to replace strut mount bearings as well.  It also smells musty every time it rains, but cannot find where any water is coming in.  Would not buy another Suzuki.  Owned a 1995 Suzuki Sidekick for 4 years, and absolutely loved it, no problems at all.  Disappointed in my Grand Vitara.  Road noise is also very loud..seems to get worse as miles are added to vehicle."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Walter Farrer, 09/18/2006,Enjoyable and Reliable,4,"So far the Suzuki Grand Vitara has been a very enjoyable and reliable vehicle.  I truly like the vehicle line, style and comfort.  Features I would have liked to have are bluetooth, a power lock/unlock button on the passenger side, and an iPod jack."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,kimmie, 10/10/2006,My 'Lil Red Fire Truck,4,"I am so happy with my new car!  I was very skeptical of small SUVs until I drove this one.  I was quite surprised at all of the wonderful safety features and how it hugs the road. It does not feel like a 4 wheel drive SUV, it feels like a luxury car. I love my new 'lil red fire truck!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,pastorbigc, 11/08/2006,Suzuki Has Really Improved,4,"I have driven in 2003, 2004, 2005 Grand Vitaras, but I got into the new body style and chassis and there were no comparison of how much better it rode.  The power of the engine and the look inside and outside are extremely great.  It has a little engine noise as you take off.  Overall I'm very pleased!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,GVCbJ, 01/24/2007,Awesome,4,"I've owned this vehicle for a year now, and I like it as much as when it was brand new. It is great on slippery roads/snow, has a lot of room for its class, and is quite comfortable for long trips.  I really can't think of anything I'm displeased with.  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,pcs1955, 09/11/2007,Tire/AC woes but overall I'm very happy,4,"Used to have a 2000 Kia Sportage that I adored. I am coming to love my Suzuki almost as much; however, I am not in love with my service technicians!  Had to spend $300 on new tires and an alignment.  AC keeps gushing water onto my passenger side floor.  Been to dealer at least 6-7 times since February with these two problems.  Overall, though, I'd buy another Suzuki."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Evelyn , 08/19/2006,Should Have Better Tires,3,"I purchased my Grand Vitara in April.  I only had 12,000 miles on it when I had to replace my rear tires. I would think the tires should last longer than that. I took the car back to the dealership that I purchased it at an I was told there was nothing they could do for me (bummer)! Check your tires! Have them rotated and make sure that your have the the air pressure checked."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,lilyj, 02/24/2011,Please don't waste your money,3,"I bought this suv brand new with 7 miles on it, it's horrible there has been muilt recalls, i've had to put money into repairing it month after month... complete waste! ( only 50,000 miles)"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,reno, 01/03/2006,We love our Vitara,5,"For the money, this car is well-equipped and runs great. We live in snow country and put four Bridgestone Blizzak winter tires on the vehicle, it is unstoppable."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Tharpomaximus, 06/14/2008,Great Vehicle for the Money,4,"Very reliable and fun to drive. No tire wear problems as others have had. Handles great in snow. Gas mileage as advertised - don't expect anything better. Seems to depreciate quickly, but purchase price was low in comparison to CRX and Rav4."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,James, 08/21/2008,Great SUV,4,"I decided to write a review as I kept seeing lower reviews for this model. I have no idea why. I have owed over 15 cars (all new over the years), and this is a nice SUV. In over 60,000 miles, I have not had to take the car in for any type of warranty work at all. Just the normal oil & lubes and maintenance. My front brakes finally had to be replaced at around 42,000. My only complaint is that the MPG is too low for this size SUV with a 6 cylinder. I get a combined of around 18.  I feel it should get at least 20. Other than that, the pricing was great and I have absolutely no complaints."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,rickb, 11/26/2008,Good Car For The Money,3,"Like the both interior and exterior style. Overall built well. Handles nicely. Being from the old school, keyless entry and drive is a waste. Too many settings for both windshield wipers and lights. Door locks drive me nuts. Up here in the mountains of NC it could use some extra hp and torque. The performance is much better in FL on flat land. We have taken this car on several trips and I have little complaint other than the mileage. The poor hwy mpg really is an issue for a small engine of this size. Gets close to the same hwy miles as my 95 Explorer 4.0 V6. Good car for the money. Stylish and nice to drive.    "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,mike, 12/23/2009,Good Buy so far,3,"I bought my suzuki with 18,000 miles already on it. The gas mileage is as stated if you drive 55mph or less, at 70mph it drops to 19/21 mpg. engine power is 'avg' but the transmission seems weak. Interior is holding together well, so is exterior. 4-wheel alignment is a must as it comes from the factory way off. The brakes seem to fade away when slowing from high speeds. Undecided if i would buy another Suzuki or not, but i think a better vehicle would be much more expensive."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Anna, 04/16/2010,What I love and hate,3,"I LOVE the radio controls on the steering wheel. The look and feel of the car is great.  I HATE that its so hard to change the head lights and they burn out often and are uneven at night.  I HATE that when the back windows are rolled down half way, a horrible pressure chamber hits your ears and an awful noise fills the car. I'm told this is because the roof is not heavy enough and if we put a rack on top, that won't happen? Oh, brother!  It's Apr 2010 and just had a major electrical problem that cost $800 and wasn't covered by the warranty. The back door stopped shutting all the way, got that fixed. The brake light comes on intermittently now. It's hard to see out the small back window."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Mary, 09/11/2010,Would never own another Suzuki,2,"Bought my GV with 17 miles on it and by 13,ooo miles had to replace 2 tires.  At 23,000 had to replace the other two tires.  Had to deal with 2 recall issues, one happened before the recall notice was made.  Brakes started to feel mushy and at 38,000 miles 2 more tires were wearing out!! Gas mileage was terrible and the head lights made driving terrible at night!  Just traded it in on 09/06/10 for a Toyota that I love!! Buying the Suzuki was the most costly and stupid mistake I ever made."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Dawn R, 02/13/2008,Hate my 2006 Grand Vitara 4x4,3,In July 2007 I replaced my 2004 Ford Explorer for a 2006 Grand Vitara which has an auto 4x4 feature. This vehicle handles good on normal roads but when winter came it quickly changed. If I hit a patch of ice it swerves left to right. Had it checked out by the dealer--nothing wrong. Was told I must have driven too fast for conditions.  How could that be when everyone was passing me? Handles well in snow and heavy snow but forget the ice or slick spots on freeway. If you stomp on it so the 4x4 kicks in it helps but when you let off it we start slipping again. I don't feel safe in this car. I'll be trading it off soon. I'm going back to Ford. 
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Subvet, 09/18/2005,First Impressions,4,"I wanted to trade a Hemi V8 that I loved for a vehicle with an automatic transmission and better gas mileage.  I knew Suzuki for their bikes but knew nothing about their automobiles.  After doing some research I found that they have been faily well known overseas in quite a few countries.  Anyway, I test drove a couple of different models and was there when the new Grand Vitara arrived.  The changes and improvements are quite noticable so I purchased the luxury model.  I am coming up to 1,000 miles and my first impressions are favorable.  The truck has good looks, and decent pickup with the V6 motor.  The luxury package makes the vehicle and it gets reasonable gas mileage. Do your research on some owners' sites and go from there.  Good Luck."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,KZ, 09/16/2006,2006 Grand Vitara,4,"The Grand Vitara has great handling, pickup speed, is roomy, it is really fun to drive with all the comforts of a luxury vehicle.  The downside is that it's a gas hog."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,fishwar, 10/06/2006,2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara,4,The 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara is a great vehicle and a great value.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,mike a, 10/29/2006,Best Buy for the Money!,4,"Before we bought, we test drove the CR-V, RAV4, and Forester.  The Gran Vitara, had the roomiest interior and is very comfortable.  It I am 6 feet tall and the wife is 4'10"", and to find a small SUV that would be comfortable for the both of us was not easy.  The Grand Vitara, fit like a glove!  It was also the quietest on the road, had a 6-cylinder engine for extra power, and it has plenty of that.  It also had other features that we wanted like air bags, front and side, electronic transfer case, and ESP with traction control.  My wife swears the ESP saved her from a wreck one day when she had to swerve to miss a car that had pulled out in front of her!  This vehicle has great fit and finish, this one is a keeper! "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Jay, 12/27/2006,Lots of SUV for the Price,4,"This is my first SUV.  I did a lot of pricing and research, and found that the Grand Vitara XSport offers the best package compared to its competitors.  I love how it drives and handles.  The interior is very refined and classy, and it has a well-finished exterior.  I am very impressed with my GV and I have noticed heads turn when I am parking or riding the vehicle.  Family and friends' eyes have popped when they ask how much this particular model goes for.  All of them thought it should cost a lot more!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Matt, 02/25/2007,Great Value,5,"The vehicle is very smooth shifting and very powerful.  It's much faster than the Jeep Liberty that I had.  The power is better that most of the vehicles that I viewed.  I have not had ANY problems with my Grand Vitara.  Neither has my wife who has the Luxury model.  I have purchased 7 cars in the last 4 years and I would have to say I like it the most, over the Grand Cherokee, Liberty and Endeavor to name a few."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,littlejjam, 03/01/2008,2006 4WD LUX MODEL,4,"After 15k miles w/ this vehicle, I'm coming away quite impressed. The power from the 2.7L V6 is adequate for most situations; I've never felt it didn't have enough power to pass or merge.  Could it use another 20hp and 30ft/lb of torque? Sure it could. For what it is, the little V6 does just fine.  The trans. sometimes stays in a lower gear longer than wanted (uphill climbs).  Releasing the gas pedal and allowing the trans to upshift, and then reapplying throttle very  gently, usually works to keep vehicle in highest gear possible. Interior design is awesome, ""clean and modern"". Materials used are consistant w/ this vehicles price range. If you want Lexus luxury, then you should buy Lexus. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,MTO, 09/16/2007,Good solid vehicle,4,"My brother bought a 2007 CRV, I like this vehicle much more.  It has just as many options and more power.  The only problem that I have is with the fuel economy.  In Pittsburgh, I am averaging about 16 mpg without lead footing.  There is a rear tire wear problem.  I am going to get a 4 wheel alignment done as suggested.  Overall, great car for the price.  It's not worth shelling out the extra money for the Rav4, CRV, or Santa Fe."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,rey, 08/17/2006,Gas Guzzler,2,I've had my Grand Vitara for six months now.  It is totally a gas guzzler. Mine is only averaging 12 miles per gallon in the city and 17 mpg on highways.  The culprit is the high reving engine and confusing climate control system.  It seems like the A/C always turns on.  It is a total disappointment.  
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,cbird511, 09/18/2012,not all that great,1,"all 4 tires only lasted 1yr, 17'' rims just makes it very expensive to replace tires and spare only had 16''rim, 6 cd player ate my cds and to replace costs hundreds, replaced battery 3X
already, replaced both headlights 3X already, replaced broken rear shock that caused the car to fishtail in bad weather, was told it was a 4WD when I bought it but wasn't, seats very uncomfortable and hard, dummy lights continue to come on randomly, brakes always squealed, interior light just fell into pieces, if your auto headlight switch is off, which is hidden behind the steering wheel, you can be driving at night with no tail lights. very dangerous, window cracks too easy. 2nd window cracking. Etc Etc.."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Frank Markowitz, 07/04/2006,First Time Suzuki Owner and Lovin' it!,4,"We had been researching available SUV's in the ""compact"" class for about two years.   I needed reliability and some ruggedness for driving in the E. TN mountain roads, yet affordability with increasing gas prices in mind.  At the last minute I passed by a Suzuki dealer and stopped in by chance.  Wow!..I loved the truck..and REALLY loved the price.   I bought the SUV without knowing anything about Suzuki cars,..and have come love it.  I got a this luxury model loaded...and got it for about $15,000 less than a comparable Toyota RAV4 or Honda CR-V.   They are both good vehicles, but not any better than the Grand Vitara has been for me so far.  I took a chance...and I got great value at a great price!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Dissapointed, 04/19/2006,Should have test driven,1,"I just purchased a 2006 Grand Vitara about 2 weeks ago and am very dissapointed. I chose not to test drive it assuming it would be similar to my 2003 Vitara. Boy was I wrong. The seats are like sitting on a hard piece of wood, the shifter is difficult to put into gear, the seat is not meant for a small person and it is not that great on gas. Lesson learned (ALWAYS test drive!!!!!)"

suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Gretchiebeth, 06/01/2010,Will never buy another Suzuki,1,I have had my Grand Vitara 2.7 L V6 MPI for almost a year and have driven it for 4 months. The first time it was at Bill Gatton's shop in Bristol Tn was two weeks after I bought my Grand Vitara. And The last time I took my Grand Vitara to Bill Gatton to have the motor worked on it was a week before Thanksgiving 2009 and it is now June 1 2010 and I am still without my vehicle.

suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,bdriver, 09/06/2006,Big Improvement,5,"A friend of mine had a 2002 Grand Vitara and had no problems with it, but the style left something to desire.  When my friend purchased the new Grand Vitara I ran out to see what it looked like and really liked what I saw.  So I went and purchased one for myself.  It has been a pleasure to drive and so far I have no complaints about anything.  I have taken some long trips with it and I always feel comfortable in it."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,scott777, 06/02/2008,Best value!,5,"Purchased this vehicle for at least $4K less than a comparable CRV or RAV4, those with 4cyl. I was very happy with purchase price and the V6 engine being we were switching from an American SUV with a big V8. Plenty of power, drove it in Blue ridge mountains NC, no problem except a little to eager to downshift.  Kids love it, my wife loves it (easy to park). Downside:  factory tires stink; worn out after 25K miles. I came from a very large SUV and still cannot get used to the ""sensitive"" handling of such a short wheelbase. The back door always sounds like it didn't close right. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,TammyC, 07/02/2008,Happy Me,5,"Bought this vehicle the day after turn in and I have loved every minute! I have found no problems with it's get up and go at anytime! Including getting on highways on short ramps and getting through heavy traffic. It's now on it's second journey to Tenn. from very flat Florida and has been a rock for dependablity. Even though it has spent most of its life a couple feet above sea level it does not not hesistate to tackle the Smokey Mtns with a vengance and ease. I do agree that it's a bit shift happy when the cruise controls on or going down hills but I dont have many hills to go down at home and the hills I have encountered (ie: Smokeys), I'll gladly take it downshifting to slow itself!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,CRAIGM, 09/14/2008,Love & hate relationship,3,"I bought this vehicle because I was in the market for an affordable, reliable small SUV that was rear wheel drive. I am a mechanic by trade and this setup is easier to maintain. However at 15,700 miles, the factory Yokohama tires are shot. I don't believe it to be an alignment issue since they are worn only on the inside just cheap tires. My wife insisted on the solid red one and I am very dissapointed that the paint is rapidly deteriorating, the mirrors are already faded to white on top. Also, there are too many cheap plastic trim pieces interior & exterior that easily fall off and im finding out resale value is really bad. This one is 2wd and has plenty of power for the size of the motor.  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,so far so good, 10/15/2008,So far so good,4,This truck is holding up well.The first thing I did was change the tire package. Changed to synthetic oil and gear oil And upgraded the stereo. It has been a good truck my wife likes the comfort the truck offers. The engine is noisy but produces just enough. A bit more would be nice. We like this truck so far. 23500 miles and still going  
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Rey, 12/25/2008,Great after 30 thousand miles!,4,"This is my second review. The first was submitted at 1500 miles. I am happy to report that the GV has held up very well, and has been very reliable after 30,000 miles. With the exception of oil changes, and front brakes I have had no problems. Even the tires have held up well. The engine sounds quiter, and feels peppier now. About a year after we purchased it we got heavy down pours, and heavily flooded roads, the GV performed admirably. It performs great snow as well. Based on my experience, I highly recommend it."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,tonyw, 03/08/2009,Dissappointed overall,3,"Have 48,600 miles on this vehicle. Regret buying it to replace a Mits. Montero LX. Really poor mpg, underpowered. Handles well after replace OEM Yokohama tires, which lasted only 20,000mi. Have had to replace the driver's seat cover because of poor fabric quality. Second will not last, either. Very cheap upholstery and even cheaper carpet (have covered with rubber mats). Brakes are spongy (common complaint) low-beam headlights have shadows and point at the pavement (can't be adjusted). Have an intermittent engine miss or transmission slip dealer can't find. Have ping in a u-joint that dealer replaced a faulty rear hub instead. Overall, this is not worth the money and has not held value."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,er1ca2000, 04/15/2009,i loved it,4,"I was actually a little skeptical of buying an SUV but this little thing had changed my mind. It had plenty of room for all our kids' stuff, roomy backseat and windows that roll all the way down in the back. It is fun to drive and handles very well for an SUV. I do wish that it got better gas mileage but that is a factor that i am willing to sacrifice. It looks cute, and i LOVE driving it in the mud puddles around the house. Most of the time it is a muddy mess but after a trip to car wash it reveals perfect paint. NO fading or anything else. I might mention it is black. My opinion... 2 thumbs way up. We will buy another if we are ever able to give this one up. 44000 miles at purchase"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Cascades Hiker, 04/25/2009,Great for 3 years...,2,"I bought my G.V. new and enjoyed 3 years of problem-free transportation.  At 38,000 miles, the engine failed and required significant work to replace a broken 2 part gear which drives the Cam.  The work took more than 6 weeks to complete.  3 weeks after the vehicle was returned to me, it broke down again.  Yet more engine work took 4 weeks to complete.  Throughout this experience, I learned that Suzuki's Customer Service is poor despite their claim of America's best powertrain warranty.  After deciding I could no longer rely on this vehicle, I traded it in for a 2009 Toyota RAV4.  Never again will I purchase a Suzuki product."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,drdud, 05/17/2009,I think it's a good SUV,4,"I purchased in may of 2006 ( V6 ),the first year milage was rough , but now i'm getting 20 plus around town and 25 plus from the N.E. corner of Pa to Phila a 120 mile run . Mostly on the turnpike .Its a pleasure to run the pike with this smooth riding and running SUV. I'm pretty pickey . I have purchased 15 new cars and trucks over the years not counting the used ones . I rate this very Good and its easier for me to get in with my bad back then a subaru which is too low."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Robert, 01/15/2008,Great little suv,4,"I have about 30,000 miles on my 06 GV luxury and have been very happy with it. This is the only compact suv with real 4WD. I drive on the beach all season with this and love the way it handles on and off road. Had one issue with a faulty throttle body bit once replaced acceleration was excellent. Love the appearance, size, interior, stereo. Hope future models improve gas mileage. Great for a small family."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,gruss, 06/23/2009,"Love it, every day I get in it!!",5,"This is my second GV. Sure the mileage could be better, but it's right there on the sticker when you buy it. I generally drive a couple of miles below the speed limit or right at it. So my mileage is great, 30hwy. Great stereo system and the six of my CD's of the moment sound great through the speakers and sub!! Seats are very comfortable, like your favorite chair. It is longer than the previous model, and it was noticed, in backseat room and cargo space. I can't say I needed it and I liked my '99 better in that respect, but I got over it. To you, drive it, love it, buy it, and love it again everyday 'till you are ready for a new one! I know, and will get another when the time comes."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Phil, 10/18/2009,No Problems Here,4,"Great small SUV that's fun to drive. Have had it just a few weeks, but have had no problems with it. The only thing I don't care for is the gas mileage, seems I'm stopping more often than i use to with my Olds Silloutte I traded for it. It however does have smaller tank too. It is very peppy though when it comes to getting out on the highway which I like. "

I have 49,000 miles now on my 06, I can not keep front tires on it,I am on my third set of tires!I know Suzuki knows of this problem!! Ive talked to a lot of people also having the same problems!Also keep extra headlight bulbs with you! about every3-4 months you will be changing them!As like another reviewer said:you mite as well wipe your crack with the paper the warranty is written on! The belt tension control arm is plastic, so around 45,000 miles it went up, costing me almost $400!Cd player does not work now,i guess the dealer would want about the est value of the vehicle to install a new one. Im very disappointed with you Suzuki!"

The choices are basically: this Grand Vitara, Jeep Liberty, Jeep Patriot (kinda), and Toyota FJ cruiser (or old 98-01 4runner)  Of those, this is the best deal, bar none. Quite capable off-road, unless the rocks are large (low ground clearance). Gotten me through tight spots in the San Rafael Swell area. Has been perfectly reliable since I bought it @ 30k miles (now has 47k), except for power steering idler pulley needing replacement (known problem - changed for '07+ years).  The ride/handling is perfect for me - firm like a truck but handles more like a car."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,MaiPhet, 09/08/2010,Need Better Seats,3,"Not bad for first couple of miles. V-6 with a manual stickshift real peppy to drive. Body style and interior design real modern. Handles well on road. But my biggest disappointment with this vehicle was the front seats. When taking a drive over an hour long my back would start hurting, I even tried buying seat covers with a inflatable lumbar. Back hurt so bad I traded it in."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,PackagingPro, 10/13/2005,So Far a Great Vehicle!,4,I was hesitant to buy this vehicle.  I am really impressed overall with the levels of comfort and features.  It has two minor flaws: 1) higher road and engine noise than I expected. 2) Window on tailgate doesn't open.  Overall I would recomend this vehicle.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,GVXR, 10/28/2005,New to Suzuki Cars,4,"After looking at and driving every small SUV, were set on a Jeep Liberty. On the way to purchase we saw the Grand Vitara and stopped. Took a test drive and purchased. It drives nice, looks great and offers many features for the money. With no prior experience with Suzuki cars, although I currently own 4 Suzuki motorcycles, it was the warranty that made the decision to purchase easy!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,John Q, 11/21/2005,First Suzuki,4,"I originally planned on buying a '05 Toyota Rav4. But after not being able to find a new one in the color I wanted with the options I wanted, I started looking at other small SUVs. I couldn't find anything I liked besides the Rav4 until I came across the '06 Suzuki Grand Vitara. I instantly fell in love with the styling of it. The exterior looks sharp and the interior is well thought out and looks more like a interior you'd find in a Lexus than a Suzuki. Right now I have around 2,500 miles on mine and I'm averaging 20 mpg. I'm hoping that will improve as the engine breaks in. The only problem so far is that the leather on the drivers seat has stretched out which the dealer is fizing under warranty."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,christa, 12/14/2005,A Very Luxurious SUV for a Reasonable Price,4,I love the Suzuki Grand Vitara! I fell in love with it at first sight. I drove a couple of them until I found the right one. I love the Smartpass system. I would recommend it to anyone.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Mike, 12/27/2005,Suzuki Grand Vitara - Best SUV,5,"I just got the new Grand Vitara Luxury Edition on 12/20/05. I am very impressed with its handling and performance. The amenities inside are amazing! I got mine with all the toys! Leather, sunroof, 17 in. wheels, and Keyless entry. This truck has great handling, a wonderful appearance, and a quality interior.  The Grand Vitara's luxury interior has tons of great standard stuff.  Mine has a V6 engine and 4WD.  It has a real truck / tank-like build and frame.  My wife loves the keyless entry and nice looks.  It has a smooth quiet ride and a neat power thrust button for automatics (puts 'sport' back in SUV). The compact body is important if you live in upstate NY. As I street park in a big city like Albany. The off-road capabilities are useful for unplowed streets and deep potholes."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Tim, 12/26/2005,Odd Headlights,4,"I recently purchased a 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara 4x4, luxury model. Its a nice vehicle with true 4x4 capability.  My main concern is that the low beam HID headlights are aimed in a strange way. The left light does not illuminate as far ahead as the right light. After much concern directed to my local dealers, I was informed that it was by design from the manufacturer. They tell me that the reason is so as not to blind drivers coming in the opposite direction. Dealerships were not aware of it, and there is nothing mentioned about the headlight aiming pattern in the owner's manual.  It is an annoying vehicle to operate at night. If you are thinking of buying one, drive it at night in a dark area."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Suzuki Bob, 12/28/2005,A Suzuki?,4,"I've been waiting to trade my Chevy Blazer ZR2 with 88,000 miles on it for an SUV that's just as ""cool."" The Suzuki Grand Vitara fits that bill! I like the firm ""truck ride"" but unlike the my old Blazer the GV is  smooth and quiet. The GV is one of the few remaining small SUV's with a real 4WD. It's a great looking SUV and feels good too!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,John K, 12/30/2005,Good Alternative,4,"Overall the Suzuki Grand Vitara offers more value for the dollar compared to the Honda CR-V or the Toyota RAV4.  Its gas mileage, ~ 19 mpg city, is about the only negative on this vehicle.  The quality, ride, handling, braking, controls, etc are excellent."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Ronald Wilkinson, 01/23/2006,Suzuki Grand Vitara XSport,5,"My Suzuki Grand Vitara is wonderful to drive. It has very well mannered handling for an SUV, firm but forgiving. The level of creature comforts far exceeds its price. The automatic climate control works great. The fit and finish are A1. Everything works the way it should. The stereo system is very nice. There is good reception on the radio for weak signals and it has an excellent sound."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Budman, 02/02/2006,Love our Grand Vitara,5,"I never wanted an SUV. Our friend convinced us to take a test drive and we were hooked. It fit our needs and it's new design was unique and set us aside from the ""normal"" look of all other SUVs. The features and quality are just as good as many other more expensive models. So far we have 4,000 miles on our Grand Vitara and we are still happy without any problems. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Nickie, 02/03/2006,Excellent Stylish SUV,4,"The 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara is a fabulous SUV.  It has great handling and is easy to drive. They make it easy to fold down the rear seats, though the 2-seater is a bit heavy to pull up. It has such a smooth ride that I barely feel the ton of pot holes that they roads in my area have.  I love how high up it is and how this height allows me to see the traffic situation from further up.  It handles beautifully and is very responsive. The ride is so smooth I don't realize I'm hitting 70-80 mph unless I look at speedometer. It's a sweet riding vehicle, very comfortable to drive and I have back and leg problems.  It makes being stuck in rush hour a way better experience."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Sgrant, 02/04/2006,Nice Job Suzuki!,4,"The 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara has an outstanding design.  It is an exceptionally well executed vehicle for an unbeatable price.  Unfortunately, it has no alarm system and aftermarket alarms are incompatible with keyless start/fob.  Also, there is no tint band on windshield.  It doesn't have a remote gas flap release and it is a bit noisy.  Other things that I don't like about it inc;ude its vague throttle response, lack of a glove compartment light and mudflaps, inaccurate gas mileage readout, and the Silly luxury features that are bundled with the low range gearing.  The rest of this truck is great.  It begs to be cornered fast and has amazing traction.  It's an amazingly sure-footed vehicle. It comes with lots of standard safety features.  We plan to keep it a long time."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,gkato, 02/06/2006,"Great Value for a ""CUV""",5,"We have owned many SUV's and we compared the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, and the new Toyota RAV.  I was at a dealership that represented many manufaturers, and test drove the Suzuki Grand Vitara.  The value and qulity for this little Cross-Over vehicle beat the competition hands down.  This vehicle is for my wife, and her main concern is 'Safety'.  The Grand Vitara comes standard with 6 airbags which usually come only in pricier cars.  The exterior and interior design are very contemporary and give the feeling of a more expensive vehicle."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Barry, 02/26/2006,What a great little SUV!,4,"What a surprising little SUV!  The Grand Vitara is a HUGE advance for Suzuki. The external AND internal styling, materials, and fit and finish are absolutely top rate!  My wife and I compared and drove all of its closest Japanese competitors - and it knocked the socks off them!  The interior is particularly good - with a modern, robust, rattle and creak-free cockpit. Its legroom is surprisingly good, although the trunk is smaller than the Toyota RAV4's.  Its gas mileage is perhaps not the best, but it is still quite acceptable.  The 4-mode full-time AWD and the proper ladder-type chassis seem to be a more robust alternative and a cut above it's more car-like SUV competitors, and the 7-year warranty is very reassuring.  I HIGHLY recommended tihs vehicle!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Tim, 02/28/2006,First year of new Grand Vitara,4,"The Grand Vitara is a well done, real 4 wheel drive SUV at a reasonable price. Suzuki was not prepared for release of this new model though. Its service techs have not been trained on repairs, and parts are not available for many weeks if needed."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,sri, 03/24/2006,Great Value,4,The Suzuki Grand Vitara has a very quiet ride. I love the way the rear seats fold.  It is easy to open the cargo door. The ability to play MP3/WMA  discs with a 6 CD changer was a pleasant surprise and it is XM ready. This truck has a lot of safety features for its base price. Its 4WD is actually full time and should be listed as AWD.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Dinakar, 03/27/2006,Great!,4,"I was looking for a small four wheel drive SUV with enough power (6 Cyl) and thought that Toyota's RAV4 would meet my needs. However, I happened to pass by a Suzuki dealership and test drove the Grand Vitara. I bought the SUV the same day! It handles exceedingly well (specially around the curves) and has great safety features. The features that come standard with this SUV can only be found in expensive SUVs. I am certainly enjoying it. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Dan, 03/29/2006,The Best of the Rest,4,"My wife and I were looking for a replacement vehicle for my 2002 Audi A4.  We needed a vehicle that could be flat towed by a motorhome and be able to pull more than 1,500 lbs.  The Suzuki fit the bill.  I drove the Honda CR-V, Jeep Liberty and Saturn VUE.  None of them offered the total package of good looks, luxury and utility that the Suzuki provided.  I shopped several dealerships in the area to get the best price.  The vehicle performs admirably and is attractive to boot.  My only complaints thus far concern fuel consumption (17 mpg) and the lack of frontal adjustment for the front seats. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,So UTAH, 04/24/2006,Just Purchased!,5,"After reviewing nearly every midsize SUV availabe for under $25,000, I instantly knew the '06 Grand Vitara was the one for me. It has an amazing look and great power behind it.  You can not go wrong with this vehicle."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,thomas, 05/18/2006,Best in the Class,4,"I purchased my Suzuki after looking at and comparing many vehicles in this class. Mainly I looked at the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V.  I love Suzuki because it has plenty of power, it's fun to drive, and it has a cool audio system with MP3 standard.  The best part is the warranty that comes with the vehicle.  It has very nice handling."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Louis Anderson, 05/19/2006,A pleasure to drive,5,"This is a terrific 2WD SUV. The 6 cylinder engine handles the mountains of NC, TN, and AL easily and delivers more mpg then the sticker claims.  This is a comfortable ride on long trips and it has great visibility. The fact that it is packed with the latest safety features and creature comforts make this a great auto.  The second row seating has adjustable backs  and the full swing open door makes it easy to load / unload especially for seniors. Its great brakes and esp make this a safe car.  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Brian Chambers, 06/06/2006,This is a Great Inexpensive SUV,5,"We (my wife and I) have searched for a new vehicle for a month.  We looked at all of the mid-line and some high line SUV's and for all around value there was no choice, the Suzuki Grand Vitara.  First look at the warratny, included free roadside assistant program. plus thier new inventive keyless entry."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,AlRod, 06/08/2006,Nice Redesign,4,"For the money, the Grand Vitara is a very nice vehicle.  It is much bigger than the Toyota RAV4 and with lots of nice features.  The '06 is much better than last year's model in looks and quality."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Bob, 06/16/2006,A compact SUV with real 4WD,4,"I have about 2,500 miles on my Grand Vitara. Having stepped up from a 4 door compact car, the only thing I miss is the good gas mileage, especially with the current gas gouging going on. I have driven mostly on pavement and a little bit on loose sandy beach trails and really have no complaints. The basic feel of the suspension is taut but very comfortable. It's a great looking, great handling, and very comfortable little SUV, whose only real competition for true off-roading is the Jeep Liberty, which, based on my experince is another $5,000, and reputed to be less relaible."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,mutter, 06/17/2006,I Just Love It,5,"We just had another baby and needed a second vehicle with more room. After driving and purchasing the Grand Vitara it has become our first vehicle.  We love the looks, performance, and the interior. We averaged around 21 mpg in every day driving.  We just went on a 1,300 mile trip and averaged 24.5 mpg.  Drive a 2006 Grand Vitara before you purchase anything else.  We drove the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Ford Explorer, Ford Escape, Chevrolet Equinox, and Jeep Liberty.  The Suzuki was better tan all of them."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,hpeaks, 06/19/2006,I love my truck!,4,I love the way the Suzuki Grand Vitaga feels when I drive.  It feels good and is fun to drive!
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,melissam, 07/03/2006,I love my Grand Vitara!,5,This is by far my favorite of all the vehicles that I have ever owned.  It drives exceptionally well.  It has every feature I could want and was still reasonably priced.  It looks like a much more expensive vehicle and the 2006 body style is a tremendous improvement over previous years' styles.  You will love it!
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Jim Archer, 07/06/2006,Perfect Little SUV For the City,5,"The Grand Virara is surprisingly nimble on the highway, as we learned on our first two roadtrips (approximately 350 miles each).  It is very comfortable for an SUV with a short wheelbase and acceptable fuel mileage.  We are totally happy with the intown driving experience...easy to park, easy to enter and exit, and easy to love.  This will not be our normal trip vehicle, but will be our first choice for around town!  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,badsuzuki, 07/11/2006,What's the Deal Suzuki,2,"My Grand Vitara makes a loud droning noise while cruising at 55-70 mph. After two trips to the dealership, and a third scheduled. It is obvious Suzuki has no idea wht the problem is. I have seen similar problems mentioned in the forums. Also, my truck vibrates so much when accelerating between 30-45 that the interior rattles. No Toyota or Honda here. This is my third and last Grand Vitara!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Chuck H., 07/21/2006,New Family SUV,5,"We traded my wife's VW cabrio on a Grand Vitara XSport 2WD last week. We needed more room since we have a child on the way. We love this SUV. The long list of standard options and safety features along with the XSport option made it the best value for the price. The exterior design is outstanding. The projector headlights, keypass entry system, sound system and a well designed comfortable interior make it feel more like a luxury vehicle than a value priced SUV. The road manners are verry nice and it gets decent fuel mileage with the peppy V6, 23 mpg average so far. My wife has a hard time admitting that she loves an SUV with gas prices near $3 a gallon."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Mary Haran, 07/22/2006,My Suzuki Grand Vitara Luxury V6 4x4 rocks!,4,"I was a loyal Honda owner until I purchased this great little SUV. I have driven it 2,000 miles so far. The styling is excellent, the ride is great. The ride is stiff but very comfortable (hey it is a 4x4) and there is no sway when turning (by far better than any other test driven). The build quality seems excellent so far, it has great features for the money. I test drove Toyota, Honda, Kia and Hyundai and drove home a Suzuki. I turn heads everywhere I go and it seems to be a safe, solid vehicle.  There are so many more standard options including safety and comfort options for the money spent. I have never had a Suzuki before but I think I am now a fan.  Its reliability will be the test."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,carloscai, 07/24/2006,Loving It but Improvements Needed,4,"The vehicle has many good things to talk about, such as nice interior, smooth drive, 4x4, 6 CD, low price...it really stands out of, the line of other Suzuki cars, not to mention those Daewoo junks that Suzuki brough back to life.  Buyers should not expect the resale value of the vehicle to be anything even close to RAV4 or CR-V. It will take more than one vehicle to establish the brand name for Suzuki. For all the lovers of Toyota and Honda, even if they are selling Cavalier, it would have the best resale value. Nothing more, you are not buying the brand here.  Suzuki should really consider putting a better engine into this vehicle, 185hp on a V6 is a not-so-funny joke. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,gailr, 07/27/2006,WOW!,4,"After having my last vehicle (a Honda) for 13 years and 225,000 miles, I had no intention of changing loyalties.  However, being intrigued by the design I opened the door and the rest is history!  A test drive and two emails later, I bought one of the first Suzuki's this dealer offered.  With extremely long legs, I had resigned myself to never being comfortable on long drives...three months and 3,500 miles later, I can testify that 4 1/2 hour trips without stopping are no longer painful!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Jessica, 08/06/2006,This worries me a little...,4,"The Grand Vitara is a nice vehicle to drive around the city. It's peppy, but not very fast. What worries me is this: when I get on the freeway, it's sometimes really difficult for my Grand Vitara to accelerate, especially when going uphill. I used to drive a '95 Cadillac Seville, and when I used the cruise control, the car would remain at whatever speed I set it at, whether going uphill or downhill. With my GV, when I use cruise control, if I'm going uphill it won't keep it at the speed I set it at; it'll sometimes go down 5 mph. Also, sometimes my windshield wipers get stuck when I turn them off. There is barely any lumbar support, so driving for long distances is tiring and a bit painful on my back. I only paid $21,000"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Christopher Trifaro, 10/01/2005,Suzuki Grand Vitara Luxury,4,I was looking for a small SUV on the likes of a Jeep Liberty.  I thought that the Liberty is an overpriced vehicle.  I looked at the Grand Vitara Luxury and it sold itself.  It had every option I was looking for for half the price.  The fuel economy was better than the Jeep Liberty and the ride was more comfortable because of the independent suspension.  Every extra option that you ask for in the Jeep is more money.  It seems like they threw all the options in the Grand Vitara Luxury for free.  Very nice truck not a snail off the line and on the highway it has some power also.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Gene, 10/14/2005,Your Bang for your Buck,4,"I researched a lot of vehicles for my off-roadster. The 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara came up just in the nick of time. I almost bought the '05 version. What can I say? Our daughter has one which is over ten years, 160,000 miles old. I just drove it cross country and it is still going strong. She now criss-crosses CA at here leisure while attending college over there. The '06 Premium model with 4WD that I have is rock solid, and with and attitude to boot, not to mention the great, affordable price. My only complaint is the short ratio in first gear. I drive the stick, but this is an all-terrain after all. Once in 5th gear, it zooms. It feels like a truck, yet it drives like a car. It is a great achievement on Suzuki's part."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,spbehrens, 10/18/2005,Happy New Owner,4,My 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara has clean lines and an aggressive look.  My wife finds it easy to drive and maneuver.  It provides good comfort over longer distances.  The fuel economy is much better than our previous 1998 Isuzu Trooper.  The price was very good considering all you get for the money.  Our dealer is friendly and helpful.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Alden Gainey, 10/19/2005,"Best 4x4 Dollar for Dollar, period.....",4,"Before I purchase a new vehicle I dis extensive research. I studied all the small and midsize SUV models in North America and finally chose the Suzuki Grand Vitara Luxury Edition. Without a doubt, the Grand Vitara offers the most ""bang for the buck"". It has sleek styling, a smooth solid ride, a quiet cabin, true off-road capability with a four wheel drive LOW gear and locking center diff.  It has an alloy 2.7 litre DOHC 24 valve V6 with timing chain instead of a belt. The Suzuki Grand Vitara has standard features that would be cost additional on all other 4x4 SUVs. It has excellent handling at high speeds. I rented a Ford Explorer last month and that vehicle sucks gas and handles like a dead pig. I am most pleased with my Suzuki!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Rafael H, 11/02/2005,Check this truck out!,4,I just got the 2006 Grand Vitara. I am amazed at all the stuff that comes with this truck and the price! I got mine with the premium package. I love the keyless entry system. The stereo is relly nice. The leather and the wood panels make it feel more expensive than it is. 
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Bev, 11/12/2005,Fantastic SUV,4,"I'm very happy with my 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara. I've always driven compact cars and I found this SUV easy to drive. The price is hard to beat with all the safety features that come standard on this SUV, not to mention the great warranty. The ride is smooth and it's very fun to drive. The interior is appealing and the exterior is bold."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,newzukiowner, 11/14/2005,You'd Think It was a Toyota / Honda!,4,"I was considering a lot of other small SUVs for my purchase.  I like the ride height of SUVs, but I wanted reasonable gas mileage.  I looked at the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Chevrolet Equinox, and Kia Sportage.  All except for the Equinox had stability / traction control, the Equinox and Sportage had V6 engines, all except the Equinox had side torso airbags along with the side curtains, all had the same basic stereo setup.  However, none had the cool SmartPass entry system which was pretty neat and why I chose the Grand Vitara.  It had all the features of the other cars minus the auto-dimming rear mirror (which the dealer installed aftermarket for me) and a slick look to it.  I'm very surprised Suzuki!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Rick Humphers, 12/02/2005,Rating new 2006 Grand Vitara,4,"I am toatally happy with my purchase of the new 2006 Grand Vitara built by Suzuki. It is very comfortable and has excellent looks. The SUV can get up and move with it's V6 engine when it needs to, yet the mileage seems to be a little better than acceptable. The only problem I have had is that the radio (built by Clarion) needed to be replaced and back center seat belt does not retract properly and had to be replaced. But the warranty is taking care of both those items. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Ryan Ellis, 12/05/2005,Not Just Another SUV,5,"My 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara handles better than any other SUV I have ever driven. I test drove the Jeep Liberty - no spunk, the Hyundia Tuscan - no pick up or response, and the Honda CR-V - poor interior and brake quality. For the price nothing beats the Grand Vitara. With the near 50/50 weight distrubution, I feel like I'm driving a sports car - not a truck. I highly recommend this car to anyone who wants to spend the right money for the safety and warranty to keep one feeling at ease. I've always loved Lexus SUVs but never wanted to spend $40,000 plus for luxury, smartpass keyless, heated seats, leather, sunroof, and homelink. Suzuki found the alternative for me and built a customer to last."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Angie, 12/03/2005,Love this Sport SUV,4,"When I get into my new Suzuki Grand Vitara, it feels like I'm in my own world.  The handling of this SUV is tight, quiet, and smooth.  The sound system is awesome and I got a sunroof added."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Joe M., 12/17/2005,Nice Little Sport Ute,4,"I haven't owned it for long, but my 2006 Grand Vitara Luxury AWD seems like a keeper.  Made entirely in Japan, the quality seems a cut above the problematic British built Honda Civic Si I got rid of to buy it.  It's not fast, but I had a comfy, drama-free drive home from the dealership during a snowstorm with the seat heaters on and knew I had made the right decision.  Everything has an expensive feel; plenty of little storage cubbies, and secure handling for a light truck make this a nice package that WAY undercuts the competition in price.  My advice: buy one now while Suzuki is carving out a niche in the North American marketplace and pricing them so aggresively."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Rey, 12/08/2005,Superb Value,4,"Before purchasing my Grand Vitarra (GV), I considered the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV4. However, after doing some extensive research, I found the GV to be a well rounded package, which offers true off road ability and standard equipment found in much more expensive SUVs. I now have 1,500 miles and thus far the driving experience has been very good. The road noise is kept to a minimum, the V6 is smooth and peppy and the brakes do a fine job, stopping short and straight. The interior looks upscale and the exterior looks modern and ""fresh."" I especially like the front end. The fuel mileage is good for a V6. Prior to this, I owned a 2000 Nissan Xterra, and that was quite thirsty. The GV is highly recommended!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Patagonia, 01/15/2006,"High value, Low MPG",4,"I bought the 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara before learning about the new Toyota RAV4 that's coming soon. The RAV's 269 horsepower and 28 mpg highway sound better than my Grand Vitara's 185 horsepower and 23 mpg. Especially since I have averaged less than 19 mpg, having driven 7,000 miles in the two months since I bought it. Who knows, maybe Toyota's fuel economy ratings are also exagerated and the Grand Vitara is less expensive than the RAV4 will be. Otherwise, this is a very nice SUV that handles much better than average, has a great interior, comfortable seats, tons of features and excellent inclement weather handling. The traction control and AWD work wonderfully in snow and ice."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Bill, 01/17/2006,A Lot for the Money,4,"I have driven my Grand Vitara for 1,500 miles and am pleased with this small SUV.  I previously owend a Honda CRV and was disappointed with its lack of power.  The Grand Vitara has the Honda CRV beat in both power and off road capability. I am impressed with the handling of the Grand Vitara in ice and snow, awsome!  The interior and exterior of the Grand Vitara are outstanding and are more like a $30,000 SUV. The only advantage the Honda has over the Grand Vitara is resale value, but that may change as more people discover the great value Suzuki has to offer with this redesigned SUV.  My general impression of the Grand Vitara is ""Great Bang for the Buck"".  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,dhump33, 01/17/2006,Very Impressive,4,"My wife and I never thought we would ever own a Suzuki.  We were planning on buying a Honda CRV or a Subaru and then one night we saw the new Suzuki Grand Vitara.  After doing our research, viewing the standard options and price we were almost sold. We went for a test drive one and that same weekend purchased it!  We are impressed with the interior quality, fit and finish.  We are also impressed with its AWD capabilities (we drove it in the snow and torrential rain).  We will certainly keep this one, recommend the dealership and the model.  Keep up the good work Suzuki!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Tom, 01/28/2006,EXXXXXXCELENT,4,Suzuki's engineers have outdone themselves. The quality of craftmanship and the feel of my Grand Vitara's interior are ten times beter than that of Toyota or Honda. You will not be dissapointed with this vehicle. It's great inside out. If you are considering a small or medium size SUV you should definitely take a look at the new Grand Vitara.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,bearsgv, 02/10/2006,Value for Money,5,"Was considering buying either a Toyota RAV4 or Suzuki Grand Vitara for my first SUV.  After doing lots of research, I decided to test drive the two.  The RAV4 looks just like the last model while Grand Vitara looks stunning and the interior is just first class.  I bought it two weeks ago and have done just over 1,000 miles in it.  I am very happy with the performance of this truck.  It is nice looking, good to drive, and has plenty of room inside."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,My Buggy, 02/12/2006,WOW,4,"This is my second Grand Vitata.  I bought a used '99 model and drove it for four years, then my husband thought I should be driving a used Volvo XC70.  In four months I was back in a new Grand Vitara.  I called the first one my buggy.  I now have Buggy Jr. I wonder if it had a more catchy name, it might have better sales (like Spirit or Sprint).  Oh well, I'm very pleased with my new buggy.  My husband found the '99 scrunchy but he's more comfortable in the '06 model. I was looking at Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 but they were too much money for same features as Grand Vitara.  I consider myself a smart shopper and the Grand Vitara is a greeat buy!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Nick, 02/14/2006,Luv the Grand Vitara,5,"I was NOT in the market for an SUV. I wanted a compact car like the Scion, but then my eyes fell on this red beauty with the premium package and I fell in love. She's easy to manuver, turns on a dime and the brakes are wonderful. I notice no noise and she's as smooth and sweet as cream to drive. She can haul so much stuff - I moved into a new home and have been buying used furniture and have been all over town.  I managed to fit a dining table and four chairs in the back. It's so convenient to know that I can buy huge items and it will fit. The stereo is wonderful, the leather feels so fine and I love the moonroof that doesn't mess my hair.  I use to hate to drive, now I love it."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,gtk, 02/17/2006,Great Little Value,4,"I bought a Suzuki Grand Vitara for my wife to take skiing, and for everday use.  We looked at the Toyota RAV, Honda CR-V, and the Saturn VUE V6 AWD, and picked the Grand Vitara for its great value, warranty, style, and features.  My wife recieves compliments daily on how great this truck looks.  The interior is first class, and the four mode 4WD system is a unique feature for small SUV's.  The mileage could be better from a company that specializes in high performance motorcycles though.  The few nit-picky items would be, no extendable visors, 4 wheel disc brakes should be standard, its lack of a locking gas cap, and the instant gas mileage readout should do ""averaging.""  We just purchased 'Crossbars and bra' for the roofrack system.  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Kevin, 03/02/2006,Great Vehicle for the Price,4,"We have owned this Grand Vitara for a couple of months now and I can not think of anything negative to say. We are previous Suzuki owners so we were familiar with the quality of product they make.  The new body style was appealing but the extra safety features won us over. The interior has plenty of room for a family to travel on a long trip.  With all the standard features, this vehicle is definitely a bargain in this price range.  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,mike, 03/20/2006,100% satisfied...again,4,"No manufacturer gives you more for the money than Suzuki. This is my 7th Suzuki 4x4. All were excellent, trouble free vehicles and this is by far the best yet. My advice is to drive every small SUV out there and then test drive a Suzuki.  I'm confident that you will be amazed. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,mihran kaprielian, 03/22/2006,Grand Vitaraas in Great Vehecile,4,"My Grand Vitara is my first Suzuki.  I think you need more than a test drive to descide to buy it.  When you start comparing the Grand Vitara's looks, specs, and features and then you drive it (after test driving CR-V and RAV4) I think you will be sold.  It is as simple as that.  Once you get, you will begin to like it more and more.  It grows on you every single time you get behind the wheel.  I average 20 mpg, which is ok but in this case is great.  Think about all the money you save by buying or leasing the Grand Vitara instead of a RAV4 or CR-V and the lower insurance rate.  It all adds up.  Don't be fooled by 30 mpg when you get the RAV-4.  Do the math and see how much the Grand Vitara is saving you every day.  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Eddie, 04/05/2006,The best for quality and price.,4,"I bought my '06 Grand Vitara in September of '05. I traded my '01 ""peace Symbol"" looking sports car for it, oouch. It was either that or pay 8 grand on maintenance. I now have just a hair over 7,000 miles on the Grand Vitara and I have had no problems with it so far. I know the basic 3 year warranty will cover any problems that I will encounter. It has the best powertrain warranty in its class, that's a plus for me. It's cheap, reliable and I no longer have to put premium fuel. This SUV will serve me for years to come, even when gas prices reach $10/gal. Now that the weather is getting better, it's time for me to load up the bikes and roller blades and go have some fun in the sun with my girl and pet Pug. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Satisfied Buyer, 04/17/2006,A Good Long Term Investment,4,"My Grand Vitara has exceeded my expectations.  This is a solid well-built vehicle. There is only one way to get this SUV - with the Luxury Package. The keyless entry and start is fantastic. My wife never takes the control unit out of her purse. The combination of two-tone leather, brushed aluminum and wood grain finish is rich and classy. The driver seat subwoofer will rock your world if needed. The driving is nimble; ride is acceptable for a SUV. However, watch when you test drive one. The dealers over inflate the tires (40 PSI), resulting in a bumpy ride. Once we got the correct tire pressure (32 PSI) the ride was fine.  The strong V6 engine gets, 21 MPG on avg (its an SUV).  For the money, extras and quality this one was the best product."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,PetShpBoy, 05/11/2006,The Grodzuki,4,"I wanted a small SUV - I test drove a CR-V but the seats were awful. I liked the looks of the Vitara (by the way I agree with the previous person, the worst part of this vehicle is the name - anything would be better).  The vehicle is very comfortable and peppy.  I has tons of standard equipment.  I ended up trading my Toyota Tacoma for the Suzuki, until this point I had only bought Toyota's. So far I am ecstatic with my decision. I recently took a trip from Central PA to the Gulf Coast area traveling almost all of I-81.  The vehcle was very comfortable.  I got 23.5 mpg going down and got a little over 26 mpg coming back.  My sister-in-law looked at it and traded her RAV4 for one a week later.  WATCH OUT TOYOTA!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,KLS, 05/11/2006,Great mid-size SUV,5,"I drive mostly on the interstate and find the fuel mileage to run around 24 mpg, which is great, especially for a 4WD vehicle."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Tuesday, 05/11/2006,Excellent vehicle,5,"This was our first time buying a new vehicle and we are very pleased with the 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara. It is very reliable, comfortable, and stylish!  I would suggest buying this vehicle to anyone who will be traveling a lot with a child and dog."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Nat, 05/13/2006,What a surprise!,5,I am so impressed with this car and the price makes it even more funner to drive. I actually do not covet my fellow driver's cars.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,blueyedangel1207, 05/16/2006,Great Small SUV!,4,We just bought the Grand Vitara and have only had it for a couple of months.  So far we LOVE it! It's a great vehicle to drive and to be a passenger in! I have 2 kids and they fit comfortably in the back seat (with 2 car seats). In the back cargo area I am able to easily fit the double stroller along with any shopping I have for the day. 
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,AL KEMNEC, 05/26/2006,2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara,4,"This is my second Grand Vitara.  This one is awesome. It's a blend of everyone's best features in it's class. It is great in the city with its open road manners and a real blast out in the mud and dirt. I know all the OTHERS are look-in and wonder- in. It's a little SUV that ""can do it"" and leave a LOT of money in your pocket to ""do it."""
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Ron L., 06/13/2006,An unexpected purchase,5,"I wasn't expecting to buy, but 3 1/2 hours later drove off with my new '06 Grand Vitara with the luxury package.  My father had owned a '93 Sidekick and best friend an old '87 Samurai, which are quite plebian by the Vitara's standards, but Suzuki always had a great reputation for its engines and drivetrains.  I got a ""killer deal"" with $5,000 off the MSRP and they are putting in the XM from my old car into the Vitara for free.  So, for $18,500 I have all the bells and whistles, moonroof, leather, nice stereo, etc... you just can't get this level of performance, engine, and a luxury package with any other SUV in it's class or higher.  All Japaneese parts and assembly is certainly a plus."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Al, 06/11/2006,Good Car,4,"Love the Grand Vitara.  I had a '99 Dodge Intrepid with the 2.7 engine and my Grand Vitara has so much more pick up  It cruies on the interstate at 75-85 mph quite well.  The only complaint, I have is on the luxury model with CD/Aux radio, I still haven't found the input jack.  I guess that is optional."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Classylady, 06/23/2006,I love my Suzuki,5,"I have always been a sedan driver.  I preferred Nissan over other sedans. When I purchased my Suzuki Grand Vitara February 13, 2006 really was in the market for a new Nissan Altima but was amazed at the design of the Grand Vitara and how easy it was to drive without feeling like I was in a big Ford truck. Thanks Suzuki for designing such a wonderful vehicle. I have been a Nissan owner for over 20 years so to get me hooked on your vehicle says a whole lot. I love My Suzuki Grand Vitara."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,john grace, 06/24/2006,My Second Grand Vitra,5,"This is my second Suzuki Grand Vitra. The first was a 2000 Limited model, which I had for almost six years. During that time I had no problems. It was a great SUV and this one is even better. It's a great SUV at a great price."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Scott A Palmieri, 06/23/2006,First New Car,4,"The interior of my Grand Vitara is loud.  It has a lot of engine and road news. However it drives smoothly.  Its gas mileage could be a lot better.  The interior could be better as well.  The parts look and seem very cheap. The seats are already pulling.  It needs a better quality sound system.  Having said this, it is a fun vehicle to drive, it handles well, and it is very stylish."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,drdud, 07/29/2006,Fine SUV,4,"I purchased this beauty after looking at Honda CR-V ,Hyundai Tuson, and Subarus . It was a few hundred more then the above but it sure was pretty.  Its ride is stiffer than Subaru's and its seat is higher if you have a bad back thats important! It rides a bunch better then Honda. It's a lot better looking then the Tuson and I love Hyundai, I've had 7 of them. Its seats are comfortable, it's drive position is good, its controls are convenient.  Its sound system is very good.  I love the sun(moon)roof and the keyless starting - all you need is the yey in your pocket.  It's great how you can lock it in AWD in bad weather.  So far, so good."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,TX SUZUKI, 08/02/2006,Excellent Compact SUV,5,The Suzuki Grand Vitara is an excellent choice for a compact SUV.  The V6 Luxury model has plenty of power and gets great gas milage.  The interior is very nice with a great stock stereo and sound system.  It is XM radio and MP3 player ready.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,kevin johnson, 08/02/2006,A Lot of Truck for the Money,4,I love the truck.  I have been watching the Grand Vitara for a bit and the articles I read all had positive things to say about it.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,CRS1122, 08/02/2006,The Perfect SUV!,5,"Ths Suzuki Grand Vitara has an excellent ride. It is absolute FUN! It has a smooth, sleek design, and I am getting over 30 mpg highway gas mileage. This truck has lots of zip."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Paul, 08/10/2006,Great SUV,4,"I am really impressed with the Grand Vitara.  It is a well built vehicle.  I like the interior and exterior styling.  It gives a solid sound when the doors are shut.  IThe interior controls are well thought our and driver friendly.  Its good handling is a plus.  For anyone looking for a small SUV, take a minute to check out the Grand Vitara.  You will be gald that you did!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Sandriver, 08/15/2006,Nice Ride for the Money!,5,"About a month ago I purchased a Suzuki Grand Vitara and what a nice ride!  At the time I was looking to purchase a small size SUV to use as my daily drive car and did a lot of looking on the net.  I basically narrowed it down to the Hyundai Santa Fe, Kia Sportage and the Suzuki Grand Vitara.  I drove all three vehicles (more than once) and decided to buy the Luxury package model Suzuki Grand Vitara for two main reasons.  One was the available horsepower and shifting, the second was the quality of the interior and leather.  The motor has more torque and the automatic transmission shifts smoothly.  The other two seemed weak and the shifting was jumpy."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Ed, 08/26/2006,A Fun Car to Drive,4,"I have 18,000 miles on my Grand Vitara and up to now I haven't had one problem. The other day while making a rather sharp right hand turn at, maybe, 10 mph, a horrible noise came out from somewhere underneath the truck. At this point, my wife (who drives the car everyday to and from work) said to me ""oh yeh, I forgot to tell you - it's been making that noise when I turn right at this particular intersection.""  It doesn't do it all the time, and I suspect that it probably won't do it when I take it to the dealership. Other than this, it's been a reliable car so far. I'm worried about this noise because believe me, it is loud. It will turn heads if anyone is nearby. The cruise control needs some refining."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,owlsnest, 08/27/2006,2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara Luxury,4,The 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara Luxury is one niec truck to drive.  Its interior is very pleasant.  It has a very solid and quiet highway ride.  Suzuki has a winner on its hands.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,bossaboss, 08/28/2006,Great Small Truck,4,"After looking at several other small SUVs, the Grand Vitara was a stand-out. Suzuki was smart to be the only make to offer a true RWD-based 4x4 against the weaker AWD car-based competition. The fit/finish of the interior and exterior are excellent, and I often receive compliments on the styling. The 2.7 V6 engine has decent power if you are willing to keep the RPM up. So far I am getting about 20-22 MPG on mountain highways. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Cj and Marv, 09/16/2006,Unknown Discovery!,5,"I went from a VW Turbo that I had for six years to a Suzuki Aerio. After one month I didn't enjoy it and traded it in for a Grand Vitara sport. This is the best thing I ever did. It holds the road, is easy to get in and out of, and the inside has a lot of head, leg, and body comfort. I am in real estate and get a lot of people commenting on this car. People stated they never thought of looking at a Suzuki, but now will take this in their consideration when they go to purchase a new veicle. I will be purchasing another Grand Vitara in a few months. One last thing, my husband who always buys a Pontiac Grand Prixs stated he will also be changing because he enjoys driving my truck so much."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,eddie g, 09/19/2006,Great Car,4,"Have driven a 1,000 miles in my Grand Vitara in three weeks.  So far this good looking SUV has not had any problems.I recently drove it to Vermont from New York and averaged 25 mpg goind 60 mph.  The only thing I don't like is the way the cruise control works it constantly floors the gas even at a slight upgrade.  Other than that, this truck is excellent. I am glad that I bought it."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,O.J MOORE, 09/23/2006,Best of the Best,5,"The Grand Vitara's new interior is one of the best-looking that I have seen in any Suzuki. The dash has nice textures and flowing lines, and the gauges are attractive three-circle fashion with faux aluminum trim. The center stack is bordered by aluminum trim and the stereo controls are more upscale.  There's 68.9 cubic feet of cargo room available. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Holly Wensel, 09/28/2006,My Third Grand Vitara,4,"This is my third Suzuki.  I started with an '95 Sidekick, then got a '00 Grand Vitara, and finally upgraded to the new GV in June.  Each vehicle has been steadfastly reliable and I'm hopeful this one is too. So far, so good. This is one solid vehicle.  It feels much heavier than the previous models. Its interior design is simply awesome and the exterior is sharp. I love the new size, compared to my '00 GV it is much more spacious. It is nice to know that I can carry passengers and have room to spare for ""stuff"". It has a decent engine - this vehicle wants to take off on the highways! "

Leather, sunroof, 17in wheels Keyless entry' 'Handling, appearance, quality interior' Grand Vitara luxury interior with all great standard stuff It had V6, 4WD, real truck/tank-like built & frame, keyless entry (wife loves), and nice looks.

suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Bears fan, 10/20/2006,Love the Cehicle,4,This is a great vehicle. It gets good gas mileage and is fun to drive. My two year old son calls it his car.  For my wife and I this was our first new car purchase together. We are from Chicago and she was sent to work in Detroit for three months. My son and I made many trips there. We loved every minute of the drive there. I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a SUV.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,KLFord, 10/23/2006,Love It,4,"I love my Grand Vitara.  It came standard with all the features I need.  It is stylish, comfortable and fun to drive.  The 5 speed has tons of ""get up and go"" when needed."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Nowell, 10/28/2006,Awesome Suzuki!,5,"The Grand Vitara is the best SUV on the market!  It is better than my previous 2002 Nissan Xterra.  Bluetooth is awesome especially for the price of only $23,500.00!  GO BUY ONE, NOW!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Bob, 10/28/2006,"Great looking, smooth handling little SUV",4,"Pros: Ride, comfort, performance, looks. Cons: rear hatch would be better if hinged at top, or at least on the driver side.  Driving experience: Solid, quiet, and very comfortable. This truck easily handles soft sandy beach trails.  This is my first SUV and I test drove only the Suzuki Grand Vitara and the Nissan Xterra because they had the components and reliability I was looking for. I now have 10,000 miles on this vehicle and all I can say is, the more I drive it, the more I like it. It handles very well, it's comfortable, I can take it off road, unlike other small SUV's, and it looks great. It's also the perfect size vacation vehicle for a family of three.  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,gary, 10/29/2006,Love My SUV,4,This SUV has a really nice ride that's smooth but reminds you that you're in a truck not a car. it handles very well in all conditions and has a smokin' sound system. I would recommend this SUV to anyone who doesn't need a third row seat. 
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,virginia ternigan, 11/07/2006,This is My First Suzuki,4,"I'm really happy with my Grand Vitara.  I think it's a classy SUV.  It is a lot of vehicle for the money.  I was looking at the Toyota RAV4, which looks somewhat similar, however there's no comparison for the value this was a much better choice as far as looks, features, and most of all the price. It's nice to unlock my car and start it without looking for my keys in my purse!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,2nd suzuki, 11/12/2006,Long Drive Commuter,4,"I commute 120 miles to work and back on the interstate every day and traded in my Verona so I could see over traffic.

suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,RUBEN HERNANDEZ, 12/18/2006,The Best Small SUV,5,"I test drove five other similar vehicles, and was very impress with the Suzuki Grand Vitara. I have been a Suzuki owner for five years and believe this is the best vehicle Suzuki has put together.  Congrats Suzuki."

suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,OhioDriver, 01/06/2007,Rear Tires Gone Bad,3,"I agree with the 8-18 dated review, by Evelyn, all Vitara owners be on the look out for rear tires going bald, it is not a Yokohama problem, it's an alignment issue.  DEMAND a courtesy 4 wheel alignment on yours before 12,000 miles or you will be stuck spending $300 on two new rear tires. Mine was out on the alignment report a lot, from the factory, but its too late now."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Soto, 01/19/2007,Can't Beat the Price!,4,The Grand Vitara is a great SUV for the price. I got mine very cheap and love the drive. It has decent gas mileage.  Its mileage it a lot better than my other SUV! I have no complains.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,shibu, 02/16/2007,Excellent,5,"I have had this truck for two months and have found it fun to drive, very adequately powered and to have a very pleasing interior and exterior.

The dealer said my heating blower went bad. Suzuki doesnt have him in the stock and they were on back order. Nobody knows when the part will be in and when I will have heat in my car.  The dealer said that I was the fourth person to come in with the same issue. Since I am not the only one having this problem to me this seems to be a recall issue.  I just want to let everybody know.  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Laura, 03/02/2007,Qwsome,4,"I love to drive this car is comfy, and you get a lot of cool things in the car and you don't even pay much for it.  I was going to buy a Nissan, but they charged me as much for a standard model as they did you a fully 4x4 sport model Suzuki and it drives a heck of a lot better."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,dsrtdawg, 04/02/2007,4th Suzuki SUV,4,Only wish mileage was closer to 30 mpg. Other than that love the car and its usuability. 1.5 ton towing capacity is great for hauling the ATVs.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,K10whosun, 06/27/2007,My 06GV,4,I really like this vehicle except for the tread wear that I have noticed on the tires.  I also own an 07 same make and model.  It also is having premature tread wear on the tires.  I compared the tire wear with the 5 wheel and it is a big difference for only 20K miles. Other than the tread wear of the tires. The car is very quick in accelerating and looks very sporty.  If holds a good bit of cargo as well.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Arnold Goodman, 05/18/2007,Love the Vehicle,4,"Looks like an SUV yet drives like a car. Handles well in local traffic and on long rides. Driven to New York and back it was a pleasure. Opened the moon roof listened to the XM radio time, flew by.  Height is great for seeing on the road, not too big so parking and maneuvering is great. People comment about the looks of the vehicle."

Outside of three oil changes, I've had no maintenance issues at all. The vehicle rides nicely on highway, but road bumps are a wee bit jarring. Engine output is just okay for daily commuting but passing is a challenge on CA highways. This car does what it is supposed too and as advertised. Alas, at the two year point I think I hear hear a Buick Enclave calling my name.  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,mjss25, 08/22/2007,My 06 Manual GV,4,"Very nice looking car, had some issues with the tires, shock absorber and skid plates as well as the fuel comsumption. Other than that, I feel very happy with my car, specially the ""looking good"" factor. The 4x4 capabilities are in no doubt, very well capable in deep mud, dust, hills and other obstacles."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,naag22, 11/05/2007,Suzuki 06,4,We were happy with our vehicle in the first year of purchase.We have now realized that we need more room and the fuel economy is not what was expected by far!! It does not pick up speed as well either.  A good car but not great. We are a family of four now and need something more efficient and roomy. 
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,ricbrk, 03/27/2008,Suzuki quality lacks,3,"This our third Suzuki, and by far this is nothing like the first two. The quality just is not there. We ended up leasing this Suzuki, with every intention of buying it when the lease was up. We will not, and we have another year on the lease. The radio reception is terrible. The vehicle rattles. Factory tires lasted 11,000 miles, my 48 year old wife is the only driver. The motor is noisy. Suzuki decided to design this 2.7 V-6 back to the 50's. Every 21,500 miles you have to have the valve lash adjusted at $1,200 a pop. Don't have it done and good bye warranty. The seals leak, belt tensioner pully last's 15,000 miles, ""plastic"", and the original Suzuki quality isn't their. Won't own again."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,Marshe, 04/08/2008,Problems are starting at 19000 miles,3,"I have had my Grand Vitara for two years now. The front stereo speakers blew out after 3 months(I am 52 years old so I did not turn the volume up to a ridiculous level) My back tires are now bald in the center only - they have not ever been overinflated and the front ones are also worn considerably all over and need replacement.  My air conditioner started making an awful squealing sound over the weekend.  Was not going to use it until I could take the vehicle in to dealership.  Today my power steering went out. ""Belt tensioner"" they say which also was affecting the AC belt. I am worried that this is the beginning of an expensive relationship once the 36000 warranty is up. Buyer's remorse."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2006,JIM, 04/15/2008,Good buy,4,"We put 20000+ miles and had very little problems. Only mechanical problem was a squeak in the steering colunm, which was fixed. Gas mileage was OK with about 21.5 mpg on hiway. The car rode and handled as good as any we drove in its class. The hood did cast a shadow on low beam. The cruise contol did shift too soon on an incline, even thought the engine had  plenty of power. I liked the car, although we have traded for XL7 because needed three rows of seats.  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,James Erb, 11/14/2006,Love the Grand Vitara,4,I purchased my Grand Vitara and immediately took it on a road trip from Colorado to Wisconsin.  I found the vehicle pleasant and comfortable.  I usually have to stop every couple of hours to stretch but in the Grand Vitara I was comfortable and relaxed for 5 hours at a stretch.  I had no issues in the change of elevation or when the weather turned snowy while I was in Wisconsin.  My return home was a battle of the driving through rain and sleet/snow and the Grand Vitara never missed a beat.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Chris, 11/08/2006,Great Compact SUV,4,"After having the 2007 Grand Vitara for a month, I feel I can fully review this vehicle.  It drives great and has a good jack-rabbit jump to it. Its interior is attractive.  The comfort is A+.  It handles great in the rain.  I love the 4 wheel drive.  The Grand Vitara does not sway in high winds (under 45 mph).  It won't shake when going over 70 MPH. One plus is the vehicle warms very quickly in the cold morning and cold in the hot afternoon!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Lisa, 11/22/2006,The Absolute Best...,4,This is the best vehicle in its category.  Far less external noise can be heard inside than in the RAV4 and even the Highlander.  I will definitely buy this vehicle again in the years to come.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Mark, 11/14/2006,Great Value - Best Kept Secret,4,The Grand Vitara is one of the best kept secrets in the small SUV market.  It delivers terrific performance on a scale unexpected for the size and class. The Grand Vitara is well engineered and thought through on a practical level.  It has lots of extras that make it a terrific value for the money.  The chiseled looks turn heads and break the mold of all the other cars in it's class.  It's refined in unexpected ways and delivers comfort and convenience along with practical usefulness in all respects.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Joey, 11/15/2006,Best Car I've Ever Owned,5,"This car is a dream to drive.  It was my first SUV and I am very impressed with all of its standard features, performance, off-road capability, and craftsmanship.  It handles well in all weather conditions and has a comfortable ride with plenty of room in the passenger and cargo areas.  For an SUV it is great on gas.  I just wish I had gotten the Luxury model with the Smart Pass Entry System.  I highly recommend it over over all the other SUV's in its class."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Ken, 10/22/2010,"Good looking, strong little SUV",4,"I like this car. I live in Costa Rica and it is particularly well suited to local driving conditions, i.e. less high speed highway and more challenging rough country roads. I have driven this vehicle through dozens of rivers and through some very rough country and have found it inspires confidence in these conditions. It is a very solid machine with both frame and unibody construction."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,07GVXS, 07/27/2009,Not a piece of junk!,4,For the money you spend for a Suzuki GV it is not a bad vehicle. However because of its tendency to depreciate I would not buy one brand new. I bought my 2007 GV Xsport 2wd. barely used with 13000 mi. last year. The problem with the rear tires wearing was resolved with a rear end alignment. Seems the factory misaligned many of these models. The new tires seem to last longer once this is corrected. In my opinion most of the MPG ratings for this vehicle are pessimistic. I get around 20 MPG in city and 23 on Hwy. However this diminishes greatly if you exceed 70MPH on Hwy. The interior plastics are cheap and scratch easy but the engine and trans. seem to be very reliable and that's what counts.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Mani, 12/19/2006,Excellent Vehicle,5,"The Grand Vitara is an excellent Vehicle.  I had to buy one after the test drive. It has lots of cool features, like keyless entry, a 6 CD player with 7 speakers, ESP etc.."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Laurie M Ryan, 11/30/2017,"WOW, this car is a keeper",5,"I am from Detroit and I have bought, leased, rented and driven MANY different vehicles in my 40+ years of driving.  The Grand Vitara is the only one I will KEEP until it dies, if it ever does.  It's 15+ years old, has about 170K miles and I can tell you how wonderful the performance has been.  This SUV has never had a true tune up, not even spark plug change, I love it.  I always get oil changes on time (synthetic), I drive responsibly and clean it regularly inside and out.  For a while I had to replace the tires often, then I found tires that would last from Discount Tires.  It seems like the bulbs on the headlamps blow too often, but hey, they're easy to replace.  I hope this car is my last one ever.  I am so sorry that Suzuki removed their dealerships in the USA.

suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,fred102, 12/31/2012,Good small truck not crossover....,4,"I have my 07 Grand Vitara since a year and half ago... so far it is doing great. I bought it will 45,000 miles and already has 71,000 and it feels as good as new....of course, synthetic oil every 3,000 mls, besides that gas. Dont use cheap gas on this truck because you are wasting your money. the truck wont run the right way and in the last run, you are just cutting the life of your truck. Tires, it came with hancook tires and still has the same in great shape. Remember and dont get confuse, this is not a crossover Mickey Mouse AWD car. this is a small 4x4 truck with a real chassis and frame and thats makes a difference..."

It handles well in all weather conditions.I live in Alberta where there is only few months of Summer and Longer Winter months.It drives like a Truck cause it is a Truck but much better than my old GM Truck.I have been enjoying it for the pass 4 years with no major issues."

I love the vehicle I have had no Major issue I have changed tire on the vehicle that is it it was at 30,000. Its reliable and I love it! i would recommend it to people. And I think people below should not complain about maintenance on your vehicle. It's part of being a vehicle owner deal with it!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,trajtman, 11/09/2006,I Love It,4,"I just got my new SUV, a Suzuki Grand Vitara and i really like it.  I just wish that I could have afforded the 4WD one, but I love mine."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,an, 01/22/2008,Pleased in the Poconos,4,"I traded my 2000 Grand Vitara in for the 2007 4WD sport model, and have had it 7 months an I love it! It is a nice ride, and it feels safe and sturdy. I have had comments from backseat passengers how much room they have and how comfortable it is. Plenty of storage room behing the rear seat for groceries, luggage, etc.  It is great in the snow, rear end does not slide like the 2000 model. My husband tried to do a ""donut"" in a parking lot to see what it would do, and the ESP kicked in, the gas cut off, and the car wouldn't let him do it! Love my sunroof, 6 CD changer, and Smart pass key. Just a great car in general."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,DR, 02/20/2020,BEST CAR I'VE EVER OWNED,5,"I purchased my 2007 Grand Vitara in September of 2007 with only 27 miles on it. 13 years later, I have 292,000 miles on it and its still going strong. I've put very little money into it in repairs, just keep up with my regular maintenance. I wish Suzki still made cars in the US!

suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Suncoast Great, 04/28/2010,Buy 2 His and Hers,5,"It has never given us any problems.  I did have to replace both low beams over the past 3 years, other than that nothing. Had to replace tires, but that's normal for any vehicle. Compared to the GM very affordable. We Love it...I'd buy another one in a heart beat!  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Scott, 11/19/2008,"Some Good, Some Bad",4,"I love the features like Smart Key that you don't find on vehicles in this class. I have one serious gripe. The mechanical valve lifters need to be serviced ever other year. I've heard it costs anywhere from $500 to $2400 out of our pockets! That's unacceptable for a modern engine. The rest of the car makers ALL use hydraulic, maintenance-free lifters. My '67 Ford even had them. Suzuki saved $100 and we will be paying for it for years to come. My valves are already ticking with only 7,000 miles. Also, the MIL came on and the fuel gauge went to ""E"" so that's my first trip to the dealer for repair. The valve train ruins it for me. Cannot recommend this SUV for this reason. Try again, Suzuki."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,JMat, 06/07/2009,Solid Performer,4,"Since I purchased my GV I've gotten married, got a dog, bought a house and recently became a father.  All along the way the GV has never let me down.  We've gone on several road trips and the GV has always been a true pleasure to drive.  It now hauls my entire family including the dog with no problem. Reliability has never been an issue and the build quality is top nothch.  The only issue I've had since purchasing it in 2007 has been a burned out headlight which was covered under the warranty and took a half an hour to repair at the dealership.  I would recommend this car to anyone."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,zuki owner, 02/01/2010,2 years and still loving it,4,"Only complaint is that the leather seats seem to be a downgrade from the cloth seats. Yes, they are leather, but not as substantial as the cloth. Drives well in all climate conditions. Live in snow and ice prone north east, it's a little bear in the winter. I upgraded tires off the lot, I always do. Need snow and mud tires where I live not the all season radials. replaced the floor mats this winter, they should come with Mud mats in North East versus the thin carpet mats. 3 rd winter and still loving it."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,terry in pittsburgh, 04/14/2010,goes everywhere,3,"In 4000 miles, I needed new brakes. The dealer covered it in. 11,000 miles I needed new tires so I bought the best tires I could get."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Aly0705, 02/04/2007,2007 Grand Vitara 5-speed,4,"I've only owned my Grand Vitara for two days, but love it! I have owned two Toyota Celicas, each for almost ten years, and was planning to buy a RAV4. Only the GV had a 5 speed manual available in the newer model, and the interior design and transmission far surpass the RAV4's. The speedometer in the RAV4 is on the left side of the main instrument cluster, which is unusual. The GV puts it in the center, with the tachometer to the left, and the gas/oil/temp gauge on the right. That is a much better design. The exterior styling is sexy, not cute. I hadn't known Suzuki made anything other than motorcycles and the Sidekick. Why isn't there more marketing/advertising for this amazing vehicle? "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,pspallone, 03/26/2007,Love Our Grand Vitara,4,"We were to buy a new vehicle due to a serious accident we had two weeks ago. We looked at Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tuscon, Kia Sportage, and Toyota RAV4. The Grand Vitara stood out like a shining star with its features, styling and performance. Best kept secret among small SUVs. Drives and looks great."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,aly0705, 05/11/2007,Excellent choice in SUV,4,"After driving smaller sports cars most of my life (2 Toyota Celicas, 1 Mitsubishi Eclipse), it was time to trade up in size. I needed a larger vehicle for business, and wanted something people didn't have to climb in and out of, me included.  The Grand Vitara is fun to drive, handles beautifully, looks great, is designed very well. People stop to ask me about the car when they see it - few know that Suzuki makes cars, not just motorcycles! "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,texas22, 08/26/2007,Traded in a Touareg,4,"Much happier with the Grand Vitara XSport.   Clearly the best of class.  Tightest turning circle of any on the market.  After 9 months, I love it."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,kacz, 03/22/2008,Suzuki fan,4,"I have enjoyed the last year with my new Grand Vitara. It looks appealing to the eye and has an atractive interior. The heating and cooling system are very good. The interior is very functional. Also, the lights are great. The safety features are outstanding! Overall, in my first year of ownership, I have become a fan of the Suzuki brand."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,nina mingledorff, 04/27/2008,Overall a good SUV for the money,4,"All in all it's a good vehicle. Gas mileage could be a little better. The tires do roar some due to the brand, Yokahoma. But so far I am impressed. I've never had a Suzuki but glad I went with the Grand Vitara. I was impressed enough with Suzuki I went out and got a Reno."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Filete, 05/11/2008,2007 Grand Vitara auto 4x4 Xsport,4,"This vehicle is fun to drive and although it could use better gearing, it does handle very nicely around curves and in the city. Love the real time 4x4. Improve gearing could also improve performance during highway driving. Gas mileage is the worst feature. After almost six months of driving, I have not been able to get more than 20.8 mpg.  Built quality and seating comfort are both extremely good, much better than its bigger brother the XL-7. If it were not for the gas mileage, this would be a great commute vehicle."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,theresaarn, 06/23/2009,Dont buy a grand vitara (WARNING),1,"WARNING  This car is a piece of junk, don't dare buy one.  Anyone who tries to convince you to buy this junker is pulling your leg.  I bought a brand new 2007 grand vitara and I must say it is the worst car EVER!  I have only had it for a little of a year and the back tires are bald with only 20,000 miles on it.  You feel like you are in a tin can that is bouncing around on the road.  If you really want to find out how this car rides, get in the back seat and let someone else drive it. You will be so uncomfortable.  The leather is the very cheap stuff and you can tell just by looking at it.  When you have the heat or the air on you feel like you are in a wind tunnel ( no kidding).  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Vickie, 06/03/2010,Disappointed,2,"At first loved this car.  Disappointed at 15,000 miles needed new tires - Have 28,000 miles on and won't pass inspection - needs new brakes and left rear wheel bearing.  Compared to my other cars in the past I never had this many problems at 28,000 miles.   Tire pressure light constantly comes on.  Very noisy when you turn the a/c on.  Just feel this car was very cheaply made.  Worried if my brakes and tires went this quick - what about the engine?"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Brannan Family, 03/23/2007,Our First SUV!,5,"We have drove several SUVs and just couldn't find the right one. When we test drove the Grand Vitara and were very happy with the style, amount of pick up, and the build of the vehicle. Especially the 100,000 mile warranty. We are also very impressed with all the standard features you receive that are usually not in other SUV's and the great pricing! We recently discovered that Suzuki offers a large amount of assecories for reasonable prices so we can upgrade as we good. This vehicle drives like a sports car, has the power of a truck, and the style of luxury and class. We would recommend this vehicle to our friends and family."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Johnny, 08/12/2008,Not for towing,3,"Decent back and forth to work vehicle, in many types of weather, buts that's it! Looks good, but I'm very dissappointed in fuel mileage and the shift points in the transmission. The dealer says there is nothing wrong with it. Well you travel 460 km's (round trip approx 920 ) and spend 500 dollars in gas (497) this is ridiculous! Hauling a single axle aluminum snowmobile trailer with 2 atv's which weigh 525 lbs and 402lbs, trailer might weigh in around 400 lbs. This thing is being sold. My old Ford pick-up would get better gas mileage . Very dissappointed, however make sure when you ask about towing small trailers before you buy."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Gecko, 12/21/2009,Disappointed in PA,2,"Okay, I did my research and it all sounded good.  Well 6months after purchasing new, the cluster{?}(all gauges) goes out.Dealer's supposed to supply rental, has none and suggests I drive it for a week until part comes in...basically suggesting I drive without a speedometer. Ya, right, is the dealer going to pay the ticket if I get one??  Thank heaven for warranties.  Then a year later, I have to replace the tires...I hear common irregular wear problem. Now at 2yrs irregular wear again?? Horrible on Ice or slippery roads, the second I apply any pressure to break, abs kicks in and you will go sliding, even on roads with heavy gravel...steering wheel shakes at 70mph..hoping to get rid of it soon"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,cuttter, 05/05/2007,Good value,4,"Fun to drive, nice looking, good interior space, moon roof, nice sound system. Very good value for the money. I looked at several SUVs in the same price range and this one beat them all by far."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,gren, 07/26/2007,In a different class,4,"The Grand Vitara shouldn't be place in the same category as any other compact ""S.U.V."" because it is actually built with proper 4WD running gear. The GV is the only vehicle in this ""class"" that offers a strong body construction and low-range gearbox.  When driving this car it feels a lot bigger than the RAV4. It might not drive like all the others in this class on the black top (car like) but off-road, the Suzuki has no competition. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,djsum5, 06/13/2009,NOT SO GOOD,1,"I've had this vehicle 2 year and I must say I don't like it. Cheap plastic products used on the interior,You can scratch the surface with your fingernail. If you have a medical skin promlem (Psoriasis) I would avoid bare skin contatac with the plastic,It may aggravate your condition. Fuel economy, I do better with my 2000 Olds  Alero comfort, Rides like a pick-up truck,no lumbar support in the drivers seat."

Everything I wanted in a car, leather, sunroof, heated seats, mp3, alloy wheels, good looking. I came across it on online and took for test drive. Needless to say I liked what I saw. Gas mileage coud be better. Factory speakers fall short but who keeps factory? Like the AWD. Comfortable seats. Needs locking gas door and lighted visor mirrors. Every time I go to my car I love the look of it. I would never have thought Suzuki for a car but I'm extremely glad I stumbled upon it on the dealer website. All around great car for the money."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,GV 07, 07/05/2008,Best compact SUV I've had,4,Very nice compact SUV. Looks better than most of it's competitors and it also has better performance as well as more amenities than it's competitors. Handles better than a car. Very fun to drive. It can be used for towing as well as for off-roading. This small SUV is capable of taking you almost everywhere you take it. My rating for this SUV is 8/10.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,josh, 07/05/2008,Nice Little Truck,4,Been a great truck for the blend of offroad and street driving we do. Tows our boat pretty well and does very well offroad compared to others cars in the same category I've driven. But it does ride a little more rough than say a RAV4 but it's a fair trade for more capability. The 4-mode 4wd system is pretty nice. 
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Joey, 05/19/2010,In Love with my Suzuki,4,"I bought this truck last week and am falling more in love with it as I drive it. It really drives nice and is very comfortable,The great thing about suzuki is the roomyness it is really roomy I had the Aerio and was amazed by the room."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Mizuki, 02/01/2007,One Fun Ride,4,"I just got this rascal. I originally was looking for an Acura MDX, Honda Pilot or CR-V. My salesman suggested I check out the Grand Vitara since it would be a secondary vehicle. I did and bought it before even driving it. I've owned Honda's since 1982 and this is my first venture to another brand. The warranty was the major factor but the ""coolness"" of the SUV sealed the deal."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Vance, 02/14/2007,Watch Out Toyota,4,"I considered getting a CR-V, RAV4, and Subaru. I was surprisingly unimpressed by their overpriced stickers and lack of standard features. Many Subarus had rattles. Plus they are now pricing consumers out of their market. After researching JD Power and Edmunds, I kept looking convinced that many pro reviewers are in the pocket of Honda. Their reviews are glowing, while consumers say otherwise. We were pleasantly surprised by the standard features and the thoughtful elegant interior/exterior. I expected a budget vehicle and found a quality surprise. This isnt a $40,000 SUV, but it certainly shares many attributes. Its materials arent cheap in look/feel! The seats are very comfortable. It drives like a car-based SUV with solid handling.  It has good power."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Jimbo, 03/15/2007,Fat on Fun; Skinny on the Wallet,5,"I am very pleased with every aspect of this true little off road hustler.  It is fully loaded with every option one could want, yet it only cost $21,000.  It has a very nice highway ride and it is nimble enough to turn on a dime.  I have not a single problem or squeak in the first ten months."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Win Aung, 03/25/2007,The best in its class,5,"Let me just say, if you own a TrailBlazer, you will definitely appreciate the Grand Vitara in every way.

suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,REB, 04/05/2007,Great little SUV for the money,5,Turned in a Mazda Tribute for the Suzuki and am very surprised and pleased with the Grand Vitara. We live in rural Kentucky about 3 miles out of town and get 21-22 mpg in normal driving and 24-25 on longer highway trips.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,dcote, 05/08/2007,Tight as a drum,4,"I like everything except, my key fob does not make a sound when I lock/unlock the door (just a click), the sticker says I have 7 speakers but I can only find four. The avg. MPG only says 16.1 mpg... this seems low, I hope the meter is just inaccurate."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,x-sport, 08/18/2007,Body and performence,4,"Really like the interior design and the exterior design, I think it is classy. It doesn't look like a cheaply made SUV.

Yes, I would buy it again."

Folks, that 99 Grand Vitara never needed to visit the dealership except for normal items like an oil change, brakes etc. My new 2007 Grand Vitara was the obvious choice to replace my old Grand Vitara at 115,000 miles. My new Grand Vitara is Jet Black, beautiful with a tan leather interior, refined and loaded to the max with everything you could ever want in a vehicle. I ran errands today with it and heads were turning and people were asking questions about it. It's powerful and well built. This car and I will be together for a long, long time!"

Fit and finish were first rate. This vehicle can ""fly"". I normally drive 64 mph on the interstate, but had to ""kick it in"" when a semi was on my tail. Before I knew it I was doing 97 mph. Sign me as ""Happy in Huntsville""."

With in 24 hours I purchased the GV. Everything about the GV is luxury, both the exterior and interior has been well designed, the leather heated seats a major bonus.  Have the 4 Mode for off road is excellent.  Amazing in snow, took it out in 20"" of snow and the GV handle it like a pro. ESP feature is another excellent feature.  I have no regrets on this purchase."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,cdang, 10/23/2007,Suzuki now has a good reputation,4,"I have driven many SUVs and cars in my life, and I'm 18. This SUV is among the best small SUVs available out in the market. For the price and standard options (most would be options on other automakers), this is the most affordable Japanese vehicle. I own an 07 Toyota Highlander as well, and compared with engine, this SUV isn't the best. Highlander, which is bigger in size has a larger engine, more horsepower and better fuel estimates (based on my driving) than the Vitara. The engine on this SUV is good for the size of the vehicle, but is a gas guzzler. The engine is quite loud. But everything else is very good.For what I paid, it is a true bargain."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,johnny.martini, 11/15/2007,Great LIttle SUV,4,So far this GV fully loaded with leather is a great deal for the canadian market. Has great handling and is less noisy. Very comfortable and smooth. A little more gas for now but it still is not broken in. It will be on course with my ex 2003 crv. Great on country roads.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,semco, 03/30/2008,2007 Suzuki Grand Vitara 4dr. 4WD auto,4,"I got our 2007 GV Lux 4WD auto last Jan as a second 4WD vehicle in the family for my wife. She and I love it. Great car, no doubt, very comfortable for family of 4 (two kids: 5months and 16 y/o). Loaded with everything you could ever want. Quality is much better than in Toyota Rav4. 4WD is impressive, CRV or other cant stay close. Just be careful with stock tires Yakohama, they are too bad in winter! "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2007,Joe, 06/22/2020,Best car I’ve ever had,5,"My 2007 Suzuki Grand Vitara is the best car I’ve ever had and still have, now with 129,000 miles, it’s still going strong and I only had to replace the computer at 101,000 miles, but that was the only major repair and the only other issue is head lights, other than that perfect car
"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,grandvitdriver, 12/22/2010,Learned to love this vehicle,4,"Overall, an excellent vehicle.
Over 85k miles...yep, 85 on an '08...without a serious concern.
Stock tires were junk (Yokohama) -- 2 non-repairable flats in less than 5k miles; replaced all 4 w/less than 11k miles.
Took me several months, numerous trips to dealer and countless phone calls to resolve the issue of DUST....a true SUV and you can't drive it on a gravel road without be choked with dust? Problem solved (simple!! keep control set to ""outside"").
I am very pleased with the vehicle.
I drive on 35 - 40 miles of scoria (gravel roads) on a daily basis...the GV has held up exceptionally well."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,sweetaries, 01/03/2010,Grand Vitara = Grand Purchase,4,"This was my first vehicle I ever owned and I loved it. The price was excellent for a brand new SUV (I looked at a 2004 Ford Escape that was the same price as this vehicle). Every drive was smooth, the vehicle gave me no problems, the inside was very spacious (I was able to move to and from college with everything packed inside), and I loved every moment in it. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,Deena Lincicome, 09/03/2015,Great for people with back problems.,5,"In 2008, this Suzuki was equipped with a lot of different features that I hadn't seen in other vehicles. I just wanted a small SUV because it's just me and my son. I'm 5'5 and have extreme back problems and can't stand cars because the pain of getting in and out of them was just too difficult. The GV seat is place exactly for my height. I can just sit and swing around to the front painlessly and effortlessly. The few things I wish it had was an outlet for my ipod, but they started making those even in other vehicles a couple of years later. I wish my steering wheel controls lit up. If I had only waited for the 2009, I see that was standard for it. It would be nice if the rear window could go down so my golden retriever could be placed in the back where's there more room, then in my back seat. My vehicle honestly doesn't use the gas everyone keeps saying it does. It's not the greatest, but it is 6 cylinders and an SUV so I don't know what people expect. In 2015 now, my GV only has 56,201 miles on it, and the kelly blue book price for trading it in sucks. My GV was hit while I was shopping and all they had to do was replace the plastic bumper and side door, which even came pre-painted, but it makes sounds like it was in a major collision, so I get value points dropped for that. It would also be nice to have removable cup holders so I could take them out and clean them. The back seat fold all the way up, but really it doesn't create more room, it would be nice if after folding them up, you could push a button to remove them. Mine didn't come with fog lights and I haven't checked to see how much it would cost me to get them put in. They now have an upgraded stereo system with navigation and all the plug-ins you could ask for and I'm tempted to purchase it, but if it won't upgrade my trade-in value, then I don't see the point....The only thing I don't like about my GV is the antenna. I can't get any radio stations and there's plenty around here.. I didn't have that problem with my honda.

suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,sodgod, 11/04/2008,Great Vehicle,4,"I had originally went to dealership to look at SX-4 crossover. Liked it, but wife thought we needed something a little bigger. I agreed, so we decided on the GV. Great driving vehicle to commute to work, great around town and on interstate, easy to park, and holds plenty of stuff. Put in a K&N air filter and averaging around 24 mpg mixed driving. Looked at CRV, RAV 4 and Escape. Went with the Suzuki and thus far no regrets."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,Happy Happy Owner, 10/31/2016,I LOVED MY GRAND VITARA!!,5,"I just lost my Grand Vitara in an auto accident where I was rear ended. I REALLY didn't want it to be totaled & was so disappointed when I got the news from the insurance company. I really wish I still had my car. The Grand Vitara was the most reliable car I've ever owned, along with a Honda Civic I owned in the 90s. And I've owned lots of different cars- Oldsmobile, Mazda, Mercedes, BMW, etc....I never had any problems with the Vitara whatsoever. It had over 87,000 miles on it when I lost it, and I had never had to take it in for anything other than oil changes, battery replacement, and a recall on the catalytic converter. SUCH a reliable car! I took it to the mountains, it did great. Took it to the beach, it did great. Drove it for 12 hour drives out of town on more than one occasion, did great. Handled well on clear roads, snow & rain, smooth ride, super quiet, really comfortable, good speakers, good gas mileage. I could drive 5 hours straight on a full tank. The ONLY complaint I really can think of, is that since I'm pretty short, the headrest curved a bit towards the back of my head, so when driving long distances, my neck would start to hurt just a bit after a few hours- but that's literally because I'm short and due to where my head was in relation to the back of the seat. In the end, my head actually hit that part of the seat in my auto accident & caused me a nice bump. If you're around 5'3"" like me with a short torso, I would still highly recommend the car but just be aware of that. The cargo area was quite spacious- I have moved plenty of boxes & a desk at once with the back seats down, no problem. Suzuki did a great job with this car. It's really a beast & can handle lots of situations well. I'm so nervous to try any other car now!

suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,jflippy, 11/10/2009,NICE TRUCK,4,We have this truck about 4 months and it is pretty nice. We have the Luxury model with all the bells and whistles. 
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,Luke, 03/06/2018,A beast in the snow!,5,"I love my GV! Great ground clearance and great turning radius! I have put this GV through many of the same demanding trails/mud/snow that I did when I previously owned a wrangler. This little 4x4 is more capable than most will need it for. Even the cargo space with the seats tumbled forward in back is great, I got a king size lazy boy recliner in there (with the back of the chair off and laying on top of the seat) without it even being tight. The proximity key is great for winter with not having to remove your gloves to get your keys, just keep it in your pocket. I had to custom fit roof racks for my GV as I couldn't find any that fit, a sawsall helped shorten the width on some other ones I found online and now fit great. Overall I would recommend this little suv, it has been problem free and a joy to drive.
"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,CraigB, 12/21/2007,Love it,4,"We traded my wife's Murano for the GV, she wanted something smaller. We spent 3 months researching every small SUV on the market. Test drive and features sold us. This is a great suv and a great value. Handeling is marvelous, and the ride is solid. Could use a tad more power.  Smart key took some getting used to, but love it now. Everything about this little truck rocks. I want to drive it, and leave my Lincoln in the garage!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,Alycia, 09/19/2008,Love My Car,4,I never imagined loving my car this much! I absolutely LOVE my car. I would never have purchased a Grand Vitara if my sister didn't work for Suzuki. I was able to get a great deal on the car! I highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a small SUV. It drives great & is extremely comfortable. The features are endless. I am 25 and live in O.C. & anyone who drives my car says the same thing. All my friends want one & the VP of my company said he was definitely going to look into Suzuki SUV's when they purchase their next car. I had never even driven a Suzuki until the day I got mine. I got it becasue of the deal & never imagined loving it this much. 
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,arcy, 03/16/2009,Awesome for the field,4,"I bought the SGV for its ""bring-it-on"" performance and it delivers.  Nothing can match the looks and the 4-mode drive-- having AWD and low range-is awesome.  The SGV is at home in the city or for light off-roading.   Its handling, build, safety, fit and finish are at a par with its closest competitors.  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,Jon Yankasky, 11/30/2008,The Lil Truck That Could,4,"The ride is astounding and the features this car has in unreal. Climate control, all time 4wd, anti lock brakes, tire pressure monitoring system and many others. There is plenty of leg room and head room and the ride is so nice and smooth. I did have the front seats altered. As someone said they were uncomfortable and it is an easy fix. In both seats are three steel rods that can be easily removed and when this is done, the seats are just perfect and comfortable. I also had an upholstery man make a 3 inch pad and add it to the center console and this car is a great comfortable ride. Buy the car/truck. You will not be unhappy.  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,kltschida, 08/20/2009,Love 95% of this car!,4,"Being a suzuki owner for the past 6yrs, I didn't hesitate to buy another. I wish I would have looked a little harder though. I got a good deal, but I understand now that my monthly savings on my loan is going straight into the gas tank. Features are missing too... but I didn't miss them until I started reading the other reviews. I didn't mind that the steering wheel buttons didn't light up until I read about it and now it drives me NUTS! I love the size, I can haul a lot inside and tow my camper with no problem. I would recommend to a friend but warn them that gas will kill ya! Nice to read about the K&N Airfilter on the other review, I'll try that! Oh, whats with not having an ipod jack????"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,lucgrad00, 07/13/2008,Cute compact SUV not so cute gas mileage,3,"I love everything about my Grand Vitara except for the lousy gas mileage. I only get 14-15 MPG in town. Other compact SUVs are far superior in this area. If gas mileage is a primary concern a Rav4, Vue or CR-V would be a better choice."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,zukirocks, 11/18/2008,"The ""Zuki"" rocks for the price",4,"Needed a tow-car for the new RV. Not a huge listing of vehicles that can be towed all 4-wheels on the ground. Looked at the Honda CR-V, Saturn VUE and the Grand Vitara. Loved the idea that we could get a 4WD tow vehicle. Inspected all and by far the Suzuki gave us the most goodies for the dollars. I love the smartkey, the streamlined lay-out of the dash, different lighting in console, auto climate control (south Texas gets hot!) Fun to drive, very responsive. Not sure on the reliability yet.  Haven't had it long enough to gauge mileage. Know it's not as good as the CR-V, but it has so many more features, we can certainly live with it. Looks to be a great little vehicle! "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,GregOgh, 04/28/2008,Suzuki...Oh~oh oh oh...what a Feeling!?!,3,"I was enamored with the vehicle but now that I've driven it a month in different conditions/road surfaces, I've feel that I overlooked a few things during the purchase phase. The seats are physically hard to get comfortable in. They're designed/built for an anthropometric model of a 5'5"" person. Leg room in cockpit seat is cumbersome and your legs go numb on trips lasting 3-4 hours. Controls for the stereo and cruise control on the steering wheel are also awkward to use when not looking directly at them. They're not lighted for nighttime operation... Extremely annoying. The stereo's tinny and rattles when the bass is on 0 & volume on 15. The cloth seats are minimal~go with leather! Good luck."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,happy owner, 12/21/2019,very reliable car,5, Bought this car new August of 2008. We still have it as of December 2019. My wife drove it for 9 years and 11 months then we bought her a new car. When we got her new car we move the Suzuki to our back up car. At that time of being a back up it had 298 k on it. As of December 2019 it now has almost 304 k on it. It has been a very reliable car with only a starter and throttle body being put on it besides general maintenance. Everything else is the ordinal parts. I do wonder if anyone else has one with close to our miles 
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,Steelers Fan, 09/16/2009,Great Grand Vitara,4,"I bought my GV after having a SX4 for a year. (Loved that little car) But I was too accustomed to a Grand Cherokee for many years! So after convincing hubby I wasn't totally crazy for trading cars, even he has to admit the GV is wonderful. I mainly do city driving, so yes, the gas mileage isn't the greatest, but not the worst either. I have taken it on a few runs to nearby states, and actually got top gas mileage. And I can fit us comfortably in it and we can look good in the new SUV! I too, would like lit features on the steering wheel, and a rear window that opens would have been a big plus! All in all, I'm very happy with the purchase.(we got a great deal by buying year end!)."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,PoPPa RocK, 09/22/2008,Great Mid Size SUV,4,"I purchased the GV for my wife due to the ever rising gas prices and let me be the first to say ""We are impressed!"" . I never thought I would ever own a Suzuki, but this mid sized SUV has it all. Now if you are looking for V8 power, buy a V8 but the 2.7L V6 has enough power to get ya' down the road. The GV is loaded with extras that most others charge for! We are getting 17/19mpg in the city and we have not taken a road trip yet. I'll report on that later. Can't complain about the handeling or size I am 6' and I have no trouble getting in or outof the GV. Heck, Just go test drive one and see for yourself. The car sold itself!  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,Previous CRV owner , 11/27/2008,Our replacement vehicle,4,"I wasn't looking at Suzuki at first  to replace our 2004 Honda CRV which was totaled after a accident but after owning and driving the Vitara I am quite impressed with its performance and styling, inside and out. The fwd/rear mounted engine is easy to work on, having low range control is great."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,Carl Hallberg, 12/19/2008,Costa Rica Grande Vitari,4,"Hugs the road better than any other car especially in the rainy mountains. Love the constant 4 wheel drive. Gas mileage could be better. Love the keyless entry,"

Handles great on dry roads as well as in the rain. very roomy, great for my family of four. the back door opening like a regular door is great for getting groceries out with the garage door shut, i could not ever do that with the hatchback door on that van! great family car and i love the way it looks!"

This is a great little suv for the value. Nothing to brag about-just an ordianry suv with limited features.  It's perfect for the local driving...  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,Rosie Mendoza, 07/09/2010,I love my cae,4,This was my very first car that I have bought. I fell in love with from  the beginning I never liked small sedans cause i just think they are too small and I need a lot of room. My car I have taken everywhere I travel at least twice a month to far places and my car was just so comfortable. I can drive 5 hrs on a full tank and I have a lot of room in my car to pack my luggage and my 3 dogs. It would have been great if they had an ipod plug but its ok. Other than that I LOVE MY CAR!
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,Supererb power, 12/08/2007,Fun to drive with awesome power,4,"It's been a few weeks since i bought it and I already love it. As others, i do have a :( about the Fuel economy but i can't complain since its an SUV. My first one for ever. Its nice, peppy and great interiors. The fuel economy of the new car generally increases within 1-2 months of the purchase. Love the ESP, Tire pressure monitoring, mp3 and great interior. The head lights are similar to new Land rovers and are really bright. I also like the audio controls on the stearing which come standard. It gives me around 20-22 (hwy + city) and 24 hwy yet but i am sure its going to improve a bit after a month. "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,Grand E, 05/12/2008,Grand ohhhh Feeling,4,So far this little truck has been doing a great job for my wife and I. We have taken a few road trips in it now and she performs great. The last trip it was a total of 6 passengers as well as luggage and all fit comfortable within the little truck. Great pick up on the engine smooth shifts just a pleasant drive all around. 
suzuki,grand-vitara,2008,Ciara M., 11/30/2019,"Easy going, just enough of everything!",5,"I've had this car for a little over a year now (bought in late 2018 with 101,000 miles on it) and I loved it as soon as I sat in it! I had an older Suzuki sedan before I got this car and I loved that one too.

This little SUV is big enough that I can see more while driving (I'm small at 5'), haul some stuff in it or with it, and still be super comfortable and spacious. I get pretty decent gas mileage for what it is and it handles really well. 

This vehicle is full of surprises and is hopefully going to last me a long time! Love it!

suzuki,grand-vitara,2009,lovebug, 01/19/2010,we got a lemon,2,"Bought truck in April 2009. LOVING the truck until the cold weather hit and we started turning on the heat. Late November motor started overheating. They replaced the thermostat. Early December motor overheating again, and no heat in the vehicle. They replaced the thermostat again, but it was still overheating. They opened up the motor and the head was cracked! They've had our vehicle since Dec 14th, waiting for parts from Japan. Asside from the mechanical/electrical problems, my biggest complaint is about their customer service. They've never once contacted us to give us an update. It's always us calling them. We usually get voice-mai"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2009,Rick, 04/29/2009,Great ride!!,4,I am glad we decided to buy this suv.  The vehicle is very solid and fun to drive.  The mileage in the city is around 21 mpg with the four cylinder that should improve with time.  Seems to be a great value for the money.  Take  one for a test drive before you count this vehicle out.
suzuki,grand-vitara,2009,city slicker, 10/04/2009,Initial impressions,3,"just bought mine so this quality/reliability rating is irrelevant.  All the reviews suggest the only small X overs you can actually take off road are Subarus and the GV and the GV is incrementally better off road. That was my deciding factor, despite reliability concerns. Always owned Hondas which have been bullet proof. My X Sport has true 4X4 w/lower gearing. I wanted the 6 cylinder with its addtl off road capability, but they are sold out in my region.  I NEEDED to buy, Suzuki has $3K rebate and Sept sales were awful so dealer was willing to deal so I decided not to wait for 2010s. The GV price was right, the interior is nice & it has some off road chops. we'll see about reliability."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2009,Terry, 09/06/2010,LOVE MY SUZUKI GRAND VITARA,5,"Owner for approximately one year. Have owned Honda Accord & Nissa0n Altima and traded a Toyota Rav 4 for this Suzuki Gr-Vitara. The Suzuki is the Best of all of them as it offers more versatility cargo area just a hair shorter than the RAV 4 but full feature with the addition of the NET for shopping pkgs etc. The all leather appointments look & feel better than the other vehicle's. Overall it performs equally to these others, is soundproof and dashboard steering wheel conveniences. I LOVE DRIVING IT!"
suzuki,grand-vitara,2009,Soldme, 06/11/2009,My Second Suzuki,5,"With only 15K on the vehicle I can't say much about reliability, but they got everything right the first time. I also have a 08 XL7 with 40K and neither has ever been to the shop xcept for routine maintenance.  One of the first things I did was check out the 4x4 capabilities and I was  surprised how well it did. My only complaint is not enough clearance and no skid plates.  I have seen some complaints about gas milage but I am really happy with it. Although some x-overs may do better it does well for a true 4x4.  I am doing better than most people will, ave. 23.5 this winter and 24.7 since the alcohol was removed for the summer.  I do drive 95% highway miles.  Overall I love it."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2009,Jeff, 09/25/2009,Big Mistake,1,"We purchased this car thinking it would be as good and reliable as the Honda we traded in. Big mistake.  After 6 trips to the repair shop and many telephone conversations to the customer relations department, the problems remain unfixed.  The warranty is not worth the paper it is written on.  We had problems from day 1.  The dealer finally admitted there were problems but was not capable of fixing them so customer service sent us to another dealer. They are unable to fix them also.  We have not been able to travel any distance all summer and we certainly would not carry our precious grand children in this unsafe car.  Please learn from our experience and do not buy a Suzuki.  "
suzuki,grand-vitara,2009,Jared, 04/29/2009,Great authentic SUV,4,"Great little SUV. I wanted a compact SUV that was an actual SUV not a crossover so I took a look at this vehicle. Interior materials and quality is top notch and its very comfortable to drive in. Heated seats warm up nice and quickly. Great styling.Engine is nice and peppy. Gauges are superb and easy to read. Brakes are good. Drives like its on rails even in snow.Very maneuverable in tight spots.Takes potholes without worrying about getting a flat tire. I bought the GV because of terrible roads in the winter and the potholes that only seem to spread more and more as well as for off road and towing.Gas mileage is not bad at all, averaging 20 mpg so far.Take a look at it you will like it."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2009,Alex Povolotski, 07/07/2009,Real off-roader,2,"The car is a real off-roader in its class. Off the pavement, it beats RAV4, HR-V, Santa-Fe, and probably MItsubishi (though I'm not sure about that one).  Besides its off-road capabilities, it's nothing else. Nothing! It's not a road warrior despite of interior creature comforts. I love the interior and visibility a lot but darn it is noisy!  It is the engine noise I'm talking about. You can't escape it, especially up the hill. It sounds like another second and the motor will explode out of the hood. You definitely have the feeling that the car is underpowered for its weight and the engine struggles a lot to pull all that weight up hill.  Other than that, it's a decent car full of defects."

I have had nothing but pickups for the last 12 years or so and was always happy...until the Colorado, but that is another story.  I decided on an SUV for the cargo capacity and wanted something compact, and different. Back in the 90's I had a Geo Metro, and my wife had a Geo Tracker, both were very well made and reliable, so it was a natural to go to the Grand Vitara.  I love this SUV, very well made, comfortable, and looks great. The only problem is a 16 gallon gas tank. Averaging 25 MPG, the tank is too small. Also, the radio stinks,too dim.   Would I do it again. At this point, yes.  You are cheating yourself if you do not look at this SUV."

The gas mileage it gets is terrible, I understand there is a breaking period however 7 miles to a gallon is terrible. I am driving a old 1977 ford truck that gets 19 mpg.

Well, I have to say that this vehicle from the start did not let me down.  The performance was is fantastic, steering and driving has been an absolute joy especially on overdrive, it takes off like an airplane. I love the Suzuki Grand Vitara so much that I went out and purchased a 2009 model. It has everything I want in a small SUV with plenty to spare. I have not driven my new Grand Vitara yet, but my expectations are greater."

Our Honda CR-V was a big disappointment compared to this car."
suzuki,grand-vitara,2010,A. Miller, 03/26/2018,"58,000 mi",4,"Bought new for $15k in 2011 (last one on the lot) so it was a steal. The former Suzuki dealership lost the GPS and owners manual but I use my iphone for GPS and Googled the manual. Almost 8 years of ownership and it just turned 56,000 miles with no problems. I live in the Phoenix, Arizona, area where it’s fairly flat and 25 MPG is normal. Being the base model, it has a 5 speed manual and rearwheel drive and that does the job.  I never towed anything and it doesn’t have roof rails so I don’t know how it would be for hauling.  The front seats are not very comfortable after an hour of sitting although I did add sheepskin seat covers.  Two sets of tires so far — the original Yokohama’s wore out quickly.  I take it to a former Suzuki dealer 32 miles away for minor recalls and checkups. NO problems; it’s reliable — never let me down.  Still looks good.  Paint hasn’t oxidized.  I use synthetic oil and drive about 10,000 between changes.  The side-opening rear gate is perfect for me. Good cargo room. Road and tire noise isn’t too bad. Our other car is a Cadillac CT6 AWD so I’m familiar with comfort and quiet.  It’s a good car; probably not much resale value anymore but it just keeps running. Since the last update I got a 2018 Buick Enclave but kept the Suzuki. Annual tags andbinsurance are cheaper the older it gets so for a few hundred dollars a year I’ll just keep it.

suzuki,grand-vitara,2010,Rene, 10/29/2010,Excellent SUV,5,I absolutely love this vehicle for it's value and overall performance.It feels rock solid on the road with no squeaks or rattles and the handling is superb. It is exceptionally comfortable in long trips and the overall mileage is pretty good. I have test driven other popular brands before buying and the Grand Vitara is a clear winner by a wide margin.     
suzuki,grand-vitara,2010,Bjorn Borg, 10/04/2017,Stay away!!!!,1,"I recently (2017) purchased a 2010 Grand Vitara Premium model with the 4-cylinder engine based on the *great* reviews given here. Please, please keep away. I was totally unaware that these models have a known failing AC issue. Your interior compartment *will* eventually flood if you use the AC. There is a connection that goes through the firewall between the internal AC system and the external drain pipe that will fail. There is no replaceable part to fix the issue. You would need to get the entire internal one-piece component, but it would still have the same flaw and will eventually fail.

First let me say that Suzuki is far under rated. The new 2010 Grand Vitara is a dream to drive. Most of my miles are highway, to and from work and support driving for my computer work. The Grand Vitara is a pleasure to drive. It gets around 24 to 25 mpg on the highway and around 20 around town. It is highway quite and all the features are very functional. My base model is equipped with navigation, bluetooth, msn traffic and fm traffic. All function through the radio speakers. Nice. Comfort is outstanding. Give this small SUV a second look. "

suzuki,grand-vitara,2010,mike nile, 07/24/2010,Greatness is here,4,"The sport utility/SUV is a nice design feels like you are driving in a 55,000 vehicle. I prefer the rwd vehicle over fwd types which end up having misalignment problems and tire issues, the towing capacity is good 3000 the others offer about 1500, the heated leather seats and mirrors are a nice feature, the engine is strong and will thrust you in your seat when you tap the pedal, plenty of pick up and go! Nice cargo space and rear foldable seats is a plus when more space is needed. Many extra features are included at different package levels on vehicle of choice. I suggest to take one for a test drive then try the competition you will then choose the grand vitara a great purchase. "

suzuki,grand-vitara,2010,Gk., 09/07/2010,Solid Rear Wheel Drive SUV,4,"Very solid feel & ride. I have owned 3 XL-7's & this is my 3rd Grand Vitara & you can tell Suzuki has improved the interior noise greatly. I love sitting up high in the driver's seat & the leather seems to be a better quality than before. Smooth V-6. Suzuki needs to step it up a little to keep up with other makes that retail for less money that have auto windows up/down, power drivers/passengers seats, larger console & a larger screen navigation unit that is built into the dash. The biggest downfall to the Suzuki's is the resale values. A loaded 2010 GV with very few miles can be purchased used for $18,000. The 0% interest, quality & styling keeps bringing me back to the Grand Vitara's."

It’s just a reliable, nicely sized, and cheap to own SUV.  Yeah, it doesn't have cruise control or rear view camera or SiriusXM, or 4X4, but it’s cheap to own and operate with good all around visibility.  Haven’t had any A/C problems except for one recharge (I did myself) after 6 years — in Arizona!  The maintenance techs at Bill Luke Fiat in Tempe (formerly the Suzuki dealership) tell me that this is the most reliable model.  Now I love the manual tranny even more.

When I got it home, I discovered that neither was included, and that the ""premium"" stereo system sounded like an old transistor radio even at low volume.  I am disappointed in this feature of the otherwise nice vehicle.  I wish I would have known this ahead of time because this is an extremely important function to me, especially since that is why I purchased the Limited Edition in the first place."

Most of my miles are in rural and center of the island of Puerto Rico, to my business and from work and support driving for my supermarket and Sport Bar work. The Grand Vitara is very secure to drive. It gets around 22 to 23 mpg on the highway and around 21 around town. It is highway quite and all the features are very functional.

After two months of owning it and another 1500 miles on the odometer we've discovered what we like and what we don't. First off, we love the looks. We love that it is NOT just another
RAV4, CRV, or Forester that everyone else around here owns. Seats are comfortable, stereo is good, standard GPS is a nice touch. The ride is a bit rough but manageable.
Rear seat is more cramped and the cargo space is lacking compared to our Forester. Gas mileage SUCKS!! It was a compromise taking the hit on mpg's compared to the Subaru we traded in, but we are not even getting the listed mpg. Mixed city/hwy of 16-17. Good car for the $$."

Too bad the nearest dealership is over 40 miles but no problems at all. Bought as used leftover from former Suzuki dealer with under 100 mi. on odometer. They lost books & nav but it was a steal.

I test drove the 2013, and can't really tell a difference from the older models. The car is amazing, and has every bell and whistle you could possibly want. I needed AWD vehicle, and can't afford a Audi, and didn't want a crossover. I did look at Subaru, and looked at a few crossovers, but this was by far the best car for the $. I actually look forward to my drive home! Open the sunroof, crank up the Rockford Fosgate sound system, and watch the time melt away!!!
My biggest dilemma is now, how am I going to get a new Suzuki in 10 years when this finally outlives it usefulness."
suzuki,kizashi,2010,mtaylor3, 03/10/2011,after one year...,4," and 15K miles, not a single regret. The car has been completely problem free and remains a joy to drive.
If you're looking for a fun-to-drive, economical, comfortable car, then the Kizashi is tailor-made for you.
Many people want to compare the Kizashi to the Civic/Mazda3, but Suzuki has in reality created a bargain alternative to the Acura TSX or even Audi A4. Best seats, handling, and build quality of any car I've ever owned. Why Suzuki isn't selling more of these is a complete mystery to me. If folks would give a test drive, I think they'd be shocked at what they can get for their money."

For months I dated a VW CC, Hyundai Genesis, Nissan Maxima, and this little terror named Kizashi.  My friends said, ""Don't pick her.  She's weird, has a funny name, no one's heard of her, you surely can't get your golf bag in her trunk.""  But every time I took her out (and I test drove her 4 times), she was awesome.  Now, she's mine.   Comfort?  A.  Technology  A.    Driving sensation?  A.    I could have married a slightly faster or prettier one, but I'm not much for gold-diggers.  I like value.  We are gonna go the distance.  And the golf bag fits just fine.  "

It looks great, got good gas mileage and was fun to drive.
As boys do, he got in a crash, a head on collison.
The car was totalled, and so was the other TRUCK.
My son walked out of that car with only minor burns where the air bag hit his arms.
Heard the safety ratings were good but didn't realize just how good!
Thank you for building such a safe car Suzuki."
suzuki,kizashi,2010,edwardc19, 01/12/2012,A Quality Ride at a Quality Price,4,"The Kizashi is a nice balance of sport and practicality. It has an intuitive and fast brake system, nice sturdy construction, push to start, and sleek look in/out. The acceleration could be more powerful. I live in a city full of hills and sometimes the car just doesn't fly through them, but the ride is solid. Low interior noise, comfortable seating both in front and back, and good gas mileage. Ipod dock is a little poor and would of preferred an aux jack for easy mp3 access. I love the dash and beautiful red back lighting on the stereo. This car doesn't read high end luxury, but its a strong contender to beat Honda Accord and VW Passat."

Its going to run me 2700.00 to replace the motor, or 2500.00 to fix it. People need to know these have chains, but the flaw is the tention part that keeps in correctly goes out.. and Boom, no more car.

suzuki,kizashi,2010,jim2491, 01/14/2011,What a great new car!,5,"After test driving the new Sonata and Kia Optima I decided to buy the 2010 Kizashi and am thrilled I did! First 700 miles I am getting 26 mpg city. Only drove a few miles on the freeway so far and the car showed 36 mpg! This car isn't even broke in yet and is only rated 23/30 mpg but gets much better mpg's. Love the build quality, fit and finish, styling, handling, and quality of the interior materials. The seats are very comfortable and the ride is sporty but never harsh. Absorbs bumps very well and is very quiet at hwy speeds. Smooth and solid ride with very adequate power. This car is my ""BMW"" at a lot less money. A blast to drive! Find myself inventing places to go just to drive it."
suzuki,kizashi,2010,hummelhh, 03/23/2011,overlooked winner,5,"When taking my Suzuki SX4 for a minor repair recently, I noticed a 2010 Kizashi parked hidden on a side of the building. To satisfy my curiosity I took it for a brief ride and fell in love with it istantly. Having owned it now for 2 months I am highly impressed by its predictable, secure handling. This car can stand up to the Audi4, BMW3 among many other upscale brands. Considering the many quality & safety features this car is a steal. Unfortunately, dealers representing this franchise as a second or third line treat it like a stepchild. Salesmen take the easy route selling Toyotas, Hondas etc. With some more effort, this car could be a great success. Wake up Suzuki factory/distributor !!!"
suzuki,kizashi,2010,mtaylor, 03/19/2010,Downsize and upgrade!,5,"Traded an '09 Mazda6 for the Kizashi, and I can't find one area where the Kizashi isn't superior! The entire car feels like it's carved out of a solid piece of rock! Ergonomics are terrific. Interior design and materials are topnotch. Gives the impression of being a much more expensive car. Beautiful gauges, especially at night. Engine is silent at cruise and idle and has plenty of power. The CVT took some getting used to, but seems to work well especially at highway speeds. Been averaging 27 mpg mixed and about 32 mpg highway. For me, this car is the perfect size.  Most other midsized cars, like my Mazda6, have grown too large. Most fun I've ever had driving, and I've turned a few heads too!"

A lot of the main auto makers are being put to shame if people would only look pass the Suzuki name and stop following mainstream they would see how much better this car is.

I went to test drive the new Optima but it felt a little too big and heavy for me, almost as heavy as the new Sonata felt when I tested that one out. I took a chance and test drove the Kizashi. SPORTY! Bought it! Thats all I can say!

I also like that while every Joe on my block has a Sonata, Camry, Accord or Altima I am not looking like a follower, I feel distinct. This car is Americas best kept automotive secret (no thanks to Suzukis week marketing department!)"
suzuki,kizashi,2010,tigerbangs54, 01/08/2011,What a terrific surprise!,5,"Picked up a new Kizashi SE AWD recently, and was very impressed with all the features, but what really got me was the solidity of the chassis and the road-holding.
This car feels as if it was carved out of a block of marble: the ride is Euro-firm, but never uncomfortable, and soaks up big bumps amazingly well.
It seems to have endless cornering grip: virtually no trace of understeer.

The interior is a cut above cars in this price range, with lots of nice soft-touch materials, tight fits, and excellent room for a big-and tall driver and passenger.
It's quiet except during hard acceleration, but what engine noise there is sounds pretty sporty to me.
Lots of content for the money, too!"
suzuki,kizashi,2010,kccarco, 12/16/2009,Great car for the money,4,"Just took delivery of a GTS FWD 6- speed.  Cant believe its a Suzuki.  What amazes me is the fit and finish of this car as well as the quiet and smooth ride.  This thing has so many standard features for what you have to pay.  Plenty of power, Great gas mileage, Rockford Fosgate Sound. Push button start,  power memory seat, and the list goes on.  Do yourself a favor and drive one of these things before you decide on anything else."

I have a pearl black fully loaded version, the only version sold in Canada. So far, the car has been phenomenal. It is quiet, refined, interior is all leather and very well put together. The sporty ride and good power are as advertised, and very impressive. I am getting used to the CVT, but the paddle-shifters compensate for tranny issues, as I would have preferred a stick, but it is not sold here. It is not an Audi, but is very close, and for $20,000 less than a comparably equipped A-4, I am a happy camper. I will likely avoid all of the reliability issues/problems encountered with the audis in the long run. Great job."
suzuki,kizashi,2010,D. K. Chicago, 07/05/2010,Best Vehicle for the Money!,5,"Not much to say here, other than you need to drive this car! Handling is comparable to a BMW, styling is over the top! Price, WOW. 24,695 sticker, paid 21,000 OTD. For the individual's commenting on the paint quality, I agree it may not have the thickest paint coating, but it's very durable. Try waxing your car with a polymer based wax. Performance on this car is great with the 2.4 and 6 spd manual, I did not care for the CVT. Do your self a favor, BUY ONE!!  "
suzuki,kizashi,2010,ToddA, 09/04/2010,10 out of 10 - Not your typical Suzuki,5,"I honestly was looking at Mercedes and Audi, the C300 Sport and A4. In between the two dealerships was the New Sutliff Suzuki. Having owned 2 Suzuki's before I knew they were good, reliable, tough little cars... But what's this big BMW looking car on the lot? After a little deliberating and going back and forth between the Big two I choose the Suzuki. Why? It's just better all around. The lower cost is a bonus. Having the only one in the corporate lot is a big plus. It drives like a BMW (think 2002-2006 3 series), has build quality like a Mercedes (seriously, not kidding around it does) and all the safety features of an Audi A8 (10 airbags, EuroNCAP 5 star-higher than C300)!"
suzuki,kizashi,2010,TomD, 09/27/2010,Luv this car,4,"Have had the Kizashi for 4 months, and have 6000+ miles. The most comfortable car I've ever driven and the quietest. Recent 3,000 mile trip averaged 30 mpg overall. It has plenty of pep, and handles hills well even in cruise control, and the transmission crosses the hills efficiently and quietly, unlike some cars I've driven. Bought the car for my wife, and she loves the memory seats. I purchased the FWD for a bit better gas mileage. Lived in Buffalo 15 years and even there never needed 4 wheel. Happy that Suzuki made the FWD available. "
suzuki,kizashi,2010,neveragain, 04/20/2010,"Paint Chip Problems at 3,000 miles",3,This car WOULD be great if Suzuki stood behind ALL of its work in its warranty.  My vehicle has numerous paint chips in it and I have had it for < 2 months.  I live in the mid-west and haven't even driven it on a dirt road yet. It also has scratches everywhere from rocks.  Paint quality is horrible. Took it to the dealership I bought it from that was 2 1/2 hours away.  The service manager took pictures of every chip at that time.  Came home and discovered there were 10 new chips from my 2 1/2 hour ride home on the highway.  Suzuki says they don't consider this to be a paint issue and it is not covered by the warranty.  Really love the car but it doesn't matter if the outside looks horrible
suzuki,kizashi,2010,lbacskay, 06/21/2010,Road Side Assistance,3,On our way to a nice day trip about 160 miles from home when the car started acting up.  Only 10 days old with 700 miles on it and the car's gears stop shifting and the rpm were running 4-5k at 30-40 mph.  We switched to manual mode and the car worked for a little while but switched automatically to drive mode and revved the engine again at 30-40 mph.  Pulled over for the third time and shut car off and tried again in manual mode. This time car gas pedal would not work.  Car worked in reverse not in drive or manual mode.  Called RoadSide assistance and thought all will be fine.  Closest tow truck was 45 miles away.  (continued)
suzuki,kizashi,2010,jim, 08/29/2010,"Great car, feels expensive",4,"Driving off the lot, I could not believe that I had gotten such a cheap deal on a car that drives like a BMW. And I've had BMWs. The interior is excellent, every time you take the time to look around it, it feels like you're in a car that's worth at least 20K more. The exterior is excellent as well, it's a lot like the Lexus IS but has a bit more curves. I really believe once you get in this car, you'll be sold. The problem with Suzuki is that not a lot of people know it, but it's really a well kept secret worth discovering. The only negative thing about this car is the uncertainty of reliability, it looks like it will be a great car as it's solidly built. The 10 year warranty is comfort"
suzuki,kizashi,2010,suzcust, 05/09/2010,Paint Problem,4,There is a problem with the paint on these cars. At first I thought it was rock chips but the more I paint chips I find on my car it appears to be a defective paint job...paint lifting off the car and flaking off.  Suzuki must stop ignoring the problem and come clean that there is an issue
suzuki,kizashi,2010,Jean67, 10/08/2010,Expectations,4," My husband and I never had a brand new vehicle. We traded in a 2007 Honda civic, which I absolutely loved. I don't know if it's us or not but the passenger's side seat is very low on the floor. Does anyone have the same problem? We have 1400 miles on it and only get 25 mpg. I'm disappointed in that. I think it's sluggish when first taking off. Don't like the funny looking long button near the speedometer. It looks stupid."
suzuki,kizashi,2010,formerreda3, 01/03/2010,First three weeks of ownership,4,"Having previously owned two VW Corrados, a VW Passat and an Audi A3 (among other cars), my comparison is with them.  This car feels like it was cut from a solid block.  It rides smoothly, ignores most bumps and makes the passengers feel like they are in a cocoon.  It is quiet with little wind intrusion and has a great Rockford Fosgate stereo (10 speakers w/subwoofer) to eliminate any noise that might otherwise exist. The 6 speed manual shifts well and the clutch is easier to use than the A3. Love the smartkey system and am amazed at how fast the heat comes on.  Plenty of room for ""normal"" sized people and far more content than I would have gotten in a comparably priced VW Jetta. "

suzuki,kizashi,2010,GG, 01/24/2010,Kizashi,4,"On 1/22/2010 my wife and I took delivery of 2010 suzuki kizashi sls awd ctv. The car drives very well,it feels very solid and tight as a drum and therefore quiet and with very little road noise intrusion into the cabin. Suzuki did a great job with the interior of the car, one will notice excellent interior materials and ergonomics, in my opinion it is much better than usual competition. The awd is a plus and the fact that one can turn it off is an excellent feature. This is not the car that was intended to beat mustangs or like cars in 0 to 60 race but if one chooses to have little fun, kizashi will deliver.  The only disappointment: cramped back seats and single cd changer"
suzuki,kizashi,2010,Tanya, 01/24/2010,Love My Kizashi,4,"I learned about the Kizashi months ago from a friend.  I had a '08 SX4 Crossover and loved it but wanted more comfort and performance.  I've been bugging my dealership and they called me the day it came in.  The first and only Kizashi was brought out (hadn't even been cleaned yet).  It was an SLS with AWD in Black Pearl.  The look, the size, the increased comfort and incredible quality and attention to detail in the interior completely sold.  They cleaned it up and put it in the showroom until I picked it up a couple of days later.  It is so comfortable and fun to drive.  What an incredible bang for the buck...and the same fuel economy that I had in my much smaller SX4.  Great work Suzuki!  "
suzuki,kizashi,2010,Pete, 01/18/2010,My New CVT/SLS Kizashi !!,4,"So Far So VERY Good...Performance & Speed sneeks up on you. 80MPH arrives with out you realizing it's there. My only Con about the car so far is the CVT while in ""Drive"" mode tends to upshift you into 6th gear WAY too soon, and if you're not heavy with your right foot, it tends to Bog down. However, in Manual mode, where ""YOU"" make the shifts, the accelaration for this 2.4 Engine is Amazing 3rd & 4th gears..even 5th are Great for on ramps & passing..6th is a Take it easy overdrive. The interior is that of a 40k car of quality..overall Suzuki has a Winner...Tome will tell..I cant wait for the Aftermarket on this Car !!"

suzuki,kizashi,2010,J D Reichert, 02/28/2010,First hand report,4,"February 27, 2010 and I purchased a Suzuki Kizashi SLS on February 20 with every option except the GPS.  Weve driven the car 343 miles sense we picked it up.  My automobile reference point was a 2000 Cadillac Eldorado that we had owned from new.  Additionally I drive a 1983 BMW 633CSi 5 speed (German version).  The Cadillac had a 300hp V8 but under normal city driving the Kizashi performs very well as compared.   For the first 300 = miles we are recording 20.0 mpg on 87 octane fuel.  The car rides very compatible to the BMW but not as soft as the Cadillac.  The highway noise level is about the same as the BMW, and both have the Dunlap SP 7000 tires, but is not as quite as the Cadillac."

First i want to get GTS AWD CVT but they dont make it yet so i put order for SLS AWD CVT. I took delivery on 2/18 and the car had 24 miles on it. Now i can't say to much about  acceleration because i have 350miles and still i am brake in a car but driving on high way taking few seconds to get to  80mph. So far i can say car is cool and fun to drive. On snow car feel steady. Interior its nice and it has a lots of room. Car has a lot of features for that price. If you will buy different car with those futures you will pay much more.

suzuki,kizashi,2010,denverdoc, 04/10/2010,This is a Suzuki?,5,"I've driven all kinds of cars/trucks in the past including a GMC truck, Saab, VW Jetta TDI, BMW, and MB C-Class 4matic. My last car was a 2009 Suzuki SX4 AWD automatic touring crossover. The SX4 was just ok, and didn't ignite any passions. Then, I test drove the Kizashi when it finally came to Denver. It reminded me so much of my most favorite car, a 2005 MB C-Class 4matic. I was instantly in love. For over a month, I thought long and hard about whether I really wanted another Suzuki. I really have never been a fan of the company. But, perceptions can change. I ultimately got a 2010 Suzuki Kizashi SLS AWD Automatic in Platinum Silver. I love it more than beloved baby Benz."
suzuki,kizashi,2010,Brett, 05/03/2010,"Excellent value, fun car",5,"I have been a Kizashi owner for 300 miles now. I had never heard of or seen a Kizashi until I was in the local mall and they had one on display. I fell in love with the exterior look, and after a week of research, I owned one. So far I have zero buyer's remorse. I am 37 years old and this car fits my style to a tee. It has a classy feel, yet it has a youthful spirit that makes it very fun to drive. The CVT transmission is slick and combined with the fine tuned suspension, this car feels like it is riding on air most of the time. Usually I stay away from a car in it's first year of release, but I am happy I am one of the first to own one of these slick little rides."
suzuki,kizashi,2010,S. J. MacGregor, 05/15/2010,What a Change!,5,"When we purchased our Kizashi,we put Pur-gen in the tires and switched to Mobil 1(synthetic oil). We then gave it a wax job.  The first time out, we averaged 33.9 MPG on the highway.  On the second trip we averaged 35.6 MPG.  On the third trip which included half city driving, we averaged 32.5 MPG. The car had excellent control and power on the highway and is very comfortable. I did not like the low profile tires as they seem to have more road noise, but was definitely quieter than my previous vehicle when it came to other noise. The Uni-body is solid and tight. What a great surprise.    "

It is so pleasing to drive and it  easy to speed due to the quiet and solid ride. I've had it almost one month and have 1400 miles on it.  My friends love it as much as I do.  The design reminds me of a Jetta or an Audi.  I wanted to buy an American car but noting appealed to me.  I like the new Buick but that is not in my budget.  I feel as if I got all of the luxury features or more expensive cars for so much less.  Just drive one you'll see what I'm saying!         "
suzuki,kizashi,2010,Greg Wade, 08/20/2010,This car has a paint issue!,4,"Just purchased this vehicle Aug. 15th 2010.  I spent 20+mins going over the exterior of this car looking for defects in the paint ( scratches, chips dents ) and nothing was visible. I drove the car home ( approx. 4 km ) and was very shocked to see several paint chips in the passenger side door.  The next day I drove this car to work on paved roads ( approx. 70 km ) The car now has several more paint chips.  This car most definitely has a paint issue.  I am not sure if it has something to do with the coating they applied for me at no cost.  I will be talking to the dealership about this, however I have no confidence that they will support me based on other reviews I have read."

Has good acceleration and power.  Haven't used the AWD, yet.  Will use it for ski trips in winter.  The mpg is not quite as high as I thought it would be.  The styling is sharp.  I like having a unique car; easy to find in a big parking lot.  Haven't seen another Kizashi on the road.  "

I test drove the 2011 Hyundai Sonata, 2011 Subaru Legacy, 2010 Chevy Malibu, 2010 Ford Fusion, and the Kizashi beat them all. The layout of the controls on the steering wheel is perfect. Everything is in the right spot and on the correct side. I have been averaging 25-29 MPG while using AC. The doors close solid, it is smooth and quiet on the highway, and the interior quality is the best. It turns on a nickel ( a dime is really too small). I only have 1006 miles on my Kizashi but nothing compares. I am so glad I picked this car. I like it more every time I drive it. "

Beautiful interior with top of the line materials, very comfortable seats, quite a few standard features found on cars 10 to 20K more. Handles great, fun to drive, and looks better and better each time I see it. Why buy a Camry or Accord when the Kizashi looks better, has more features for the dollar, and a 7 year 100,000 mile warranty! Suzuki has a winner here. "
suzuki,kizashi,2010,Middle-age Dad, 05/11/2018,Wish I could buy a new one,5,"UPDATE:
At 130k miles, the mileage is actually the best it has ever been, corners amazingly, and is responsive in traffic and on the highway. I had to replace the brakes at 120k miles then the water pump at 125k miles. The pump was a bit more $ than desired but that is because of the difficult to reach location. At 130k miles, it still rides perfectly.  Once a month it won't start, reading ""Steering Wheel Lock is On."" After a few times wiggling the wheel and opening and shutting the driver door, it cranks right up. It is actually a common problem with the car (see kizashiclub.com) based on a little motor in the steering column that malfunctions. So, minor concerns and typical maintenance items only. Its got another 10-15k miles left, we hope. I have one more new driver to beat it up.

ORIGINAL:
I bought the Kizashi for my teen because of the great crash test ratings and the safety of awd. That was 20k ago and now at 110k it is my favorite car to drive. 
Overall: It’s very smooth, great in turns, awd tackles snow well (with the right tires of course) and has room for a family of four. Truth be told, I grab the car and give my teen the minivan on weekends if she is too slow to get started.
Comfort: Contoured memory seats, rear a/c vents, quiet
Power: Decent but nothing exciting which fits my middle-aged needs; Braking is powerful and very safe 
Downsides: CVT saps the power on takeoff and the CVT whine concerns me for longevity but there is a TSB to help that a bit; paint chips easily but it’s older now anyway; a trustworthy Suzuki repair facility is an hour away and parts are tough to come by. 

Overall, this is a great car that I would consider new if possible.

I now have 189k miles on it, trouble free. Everything is just where it needs to be and works flawlessly. Sporty performance, great handling, fit and finish are excellent. The seats with lumbar support are excellent for long distance travel. The biggest and only ""major"" issue was replacement of the Rockford Fosgate stereo amplifier in the trunk, under warranty. I have owned Toyota, Honda (Civic and Accord), Nissan and BMW cars over the years and am picky. This Suzuki has been my best car so far. The car still runs like new and I'm having a difficult time deciding what to replace it with. I would buy another Kizashi in a heartbeat...if the were still made. Ugh...

While we were waiting we saw the silver GTS and fell in love.  Took it for a drive and came home with it.  I hate impulse buys, but I've not had any regrets with this purchase.  I always wanted navigation, and this GTS had it installed.  Stereo is wonderful, although I was surprised it only held one cd.  Used the IPOD connection, and it sounded wonderful.  Bluetooth worked with Iphone just great.  I could go on and on.  Oh, I could have gotten a 2010 for a lot less, but I really liked the changes in body styling on the 2011. "

I have fallen in love with the Kizashi so I only want to mention the things I didn't like or am not used to. 
Car is extremely beautiful but too low, I'd be scared to drive on serious bumps/snow. Doors don't lock automatically when you start driving. All four windows are not on one touch auto like jetta (I am spoiled by this jetta feature). Center armrest doesn't extend forward like jetta. Floor Mats are too black, can see dirt. Harsh ride in the GTS sport trim that we got. Has bump steer because of strong suspension. Front passenger seat can't be moved up and down like the Jetta."
suzuki,kizashi,2011,realitycheck1, 02/19/2011,Excellent Car,4,"I bought a white Kizashi 2 months ago and I could not be happier. This car has the most fluid steering I have ever felt in a regular mid sized sedan. It has a very expensive feel to it in how it drives and the interior quality is excellent. Very quiet. I average 27 MPG around town and I've got 32 MPG on the highway. No problems as of yet, but of course the car is still brand new so I don't expect any. I love how few people own these and I get inquires all the time about it. Fantastic car."
suzuki,kizashi,2011,tlc64, 11/19/2011,Completly suprised,4,"Always been a Honda guy but the more we use this little Kizashi the more we like it. Smooth and quiet and gets better with miles.

suzuki,kizashi,2011,firefly1366, 04/16/2011,Love this car,4,"The Kizashi was on my short list to test drive, along with the new Optima. I drove the Optima first. Then I got in the Kizashi and the Optima quickly became a fuzzy memory. This car is fun to drive, the design and quality of the interior is top-notch, and its looks get compliments everywhere. Power is adequate for my needs. It is larger than it looks in pictures. Rear seat room is a bit less than most competitors, but four adults fit comfortably. The seats are well shaped and supportive, even in back, unlike the rear seat in the Optima which felt low, flat and dark. "
suzuki,kizashi,2011,angel973, 11/22/2011,Opinion Changer,5,"This car totally changes my opinion against Suzuki vehicles.

I used to own a Suzuki XL-7 4WD Limited. It left much to be desired in many ways and as a result I traded it in with a Nissan after owning it for just a
short time while it was still in a pretty good condition. I thought I would never buy a Suzuki again. Lo and behold I came across this beautiful car by chance. Both my wife and I love this car. Its look - both the interior and exterior - is quite pleasing to the eyes. The ride is smooth and comfortable. The performance is surprisingly exciting. Not to mention that you get possibly the best bang for your buck.

The bottom line is, this is really a great car and worth looking into."

From a mechanical and fun to drive standpoint, its great, but the painted metal surfaces are rusting and Suzuki is denying it as a defect, claiming instead that its an environmental.
I haven't owned many cars that rusted, let alone with only 6000 miles on them.
 Needless to say, my good will towards the company is lost and now it will become a legal matter.
Its ashame really, as I did whole lot of research before picking this car.....so I really wanted it. Now I'm not so sure.....and who really know's the extent of the rust....it could be encompass the entirely of the unibody.

This one caught my eye as soon as I saw it on the road and I had to find out what it was and where to test drive one at. I was driving a Mustang GT at the time which is an awesome car in itself. This one didn't quite have the GT pep but this old lady needed to chill a bit and this car was perfect. I also owned a Lexus IS 250 and this reminded me of it almost to a tee.

When i think i'm doing 60 Im usually doing 80. They really covered their bases with every comfort detail no matter how small.

suzuki,kizashi,2011,bannondorf, 03/03/2012,Best Kept Secret,4,"I have owned this vehicle for three months now and can say it is probably the best kept secret in the car industry. Safer than a Volvo, as or more responsive and sporty than a BMW or Audi and much less expensive than any of those. For being the best selling car in Japan I am surprised no one in America has ever heard of it, likely do to a non-existent ad campaign. Great Warranty, Fun to drive, turns heads everywhere I go. The quality of the build, fit, finish and all the little details and gadgets Suzuki included are impressive. This car is defiantly worth a test drive even if your looking at its more expensive European cousins exclusively. "
suzuki,kizashi,2011,edbearnz, 11/09/2011,Is this the best value car you can buy?,4,"We recently purchased our second new car, (weve had many second hand cars over the years), having had to sell our 12 year-old Nissan Pulsar SLX due to me breaking my back in a car accident last year. The seating position of the Pulsar was no longer tenable for me and I had to get a vehicle with a higher, more ergonomically correct seat. We bought the Pulsar new in 1999 and it had been a pleasure to own and was well specced for the time with ABS, driver's air-bag, four-wheel disc brakes, air-conditioning, factory alloys and the engine was chain-drive DOHC with VVT. It was the cheapest car to own we'd ever had and I was sad to see it go.
 
After briefly considering second hand cars, I was conscious that had I been driving a vehicle with traction control, I would not have crashed, spinning out on oil, so when looking at later models with this feature I decided to go with another new car. My requirements centered around my physical needs, but I wanted several other things. The car had to have the latest in technology as I felt it was a waste of time buying older technology that was already outdated and due to be replaced. I wanted fuel economy that was at least as good as the 1600cc Nissan Pulsar auto we'd just sold and the car had to be value for money. 
 
We wanted an automatic so manual cars were not considered. This ruled out the otherwise excellent Ford Fiesta Econetic as it was only available in manual form. So too, the Toyota Rav4 diesel, the petrol being too thirsty. It became apparent early on that the small cars of today are excellent vehicles and all were superior in power and economy, ride and handling and of course features by comparison to our 12 year old Pulsar, with the Honda City the best over all, but the Swift being cheaper equalled the ride and comfort factor emphasising to me just why it is NZ's best selling small car. Also in the early running was the Honda Insight hybrid, which I liked but the passenger seat was uncomfortable and my wife didn't like the rear view through the mirror, the split window was disconcerting to her. So despite the lowest running costs, even over the Fiesta once RUC's, were counted, (Road User Charges - New Zealand has a separate charge for mileage on diesel vehicles on a $ per Kilometer basis, and Diesel fuel is not taxed at the pump. Depending on size and type of vehicle you pay a particular charge per Kilometer), the Insight dropped off the list.
 
I looked at SUV's but despite the great performance and economy of the new generation diesel's, with the Hyundai ix35 being the best of them, I didn't need the size and expense. On a $ per km figure including RUC's they were going to cost the same as the medium sized petrol cars to run. So that left me to look at the medium car market as an alternative to buying a small car. The Suzuki SX4i AWD is unique and a great wee SUV with comfort, features and power, but let itself down on wind and engine noise. A shame because otherwise I'd have bought it!
 
It was amazing to realise that the new cars with 2.4lt engines could equal the Pulsar for fuel economy while being a lot bigger and a lot more powerful! I compared the Ford Mondeo Titanium Hatch diesel, the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord Euro, Hyundai i45, VW Passat and the Suzuki Kizashi Ltd. and Sport.
 
The Camry was the first to go as it was dearer and less economical and while the ride and seating were comfortable it was very plain-Jane. It was also a run-out model, due to be replaced with an all new one. The VW was too dear as was the Honda Accord. The Hyundai was my early favourite for technology, style, economy, features and seemed good value. It was perfect in driving position and nearly took the prize. Until I tried the Kizashi...
 
What can I say? I run out of superlatives to describe this car! All the neighbours are jealous, all our friends love it, especially the colour and my wife
 doesn't want to get out of it. The heated seats and dual-zone climate air were the clincher for her, as was the colour and tints which set the car off beautifully! My back is happy and we look forward to many years of service from what has to be the best mid-sized car on the road today!

suzuki,kizashi,2011,colonel1961, 10/08/2011,Gps/Bluetooth system,4,"My daughter just bought this vehicle and frequently leaves it with me while she is on business trips.
I was very impressed with the quality and value and would have purchased one until I tried out the GPS/navigation/bluetooth system.
I had trouble setting up the bluetooth phone connection and finally went back to the dealer to get some instructions.
There they told me I could not make a phone call using the voice system or the manual dial keypad unless the car was parked and had the emergency brake on.
This makes the system useless.
I have two other cars, a Prius and a Mercedes both of which let me push a button on the steering wheel and make a call using only my voice while driving."

I travel in heavy traffic to work with light driving on the week ends I average a disappointing 22MPG.

I have had studded tires on the car for most of that time.
When I put my studs on the console lit up and locked me out of my features. The tire pressure monitoring system was locking the dash up.
I had to pay $300.00 for computerized valve stems.
I also found that each time I change my tires out I must pay the dealer $30.00 to re-set the TPMS in the on-board computer. Other servicers (Les Schwab) could not do the re-set."
suzuki,kizashi,2011,sabkosalam, 09/06/2011,2nd review after 4 months with car,4,"There is no way you'll find a better car for this price. It feels 10k more when you get inside. Nice materials inside. I just wish the GTS manual had leather available as an option. The cloth seats are good material too though.
To this day, car is turning heads and people seem to look for which car it is. If I take away the Suzuki badges from the car exterior, people will think I'm filthy rich. The guy at the car wash literally sat in it for a good 2 minutes checking the car out. Candidly speaking, I am glad the car is not selling very well. Otherwise it'll just become another Sonata, people are already bored with its looks."
suzuki,kizashi,2011,rpbsp, 01/14/2012,Lots of Fun .... BUT,4,"Bought my Kizashi 6 months ago and have 14,000 miles on it.
Fun to drive, sleek appearance and great gas mileage.
However, the longer you live with it, the more it shows its weak design points.
Two major complaints. 1. the paint is paper thin-chips if you look at it the wrong way.
2.windshield washers are useless for winter driving.
they freeze after 1 squirt and that first squirt doesn't even hit the windshield. The car could be considered unsafe to drive in messy winter roads ... zero visibility."
suzuki,kizashi,2011,hraez, 09/04/2011,kizashi experience,5,"Just purchased a 2011 Kizashi SE, I have to say that for the money there is absolutely nothing that comes close to this car, I test drove the KIA Optima, Buick Regal, Volvo C30, Mini Clubman, even the Mazda CX7 and I thought the value offered by the Kizashi couldn't be matched. I encourage anyone looking for a midsized or sport sedan to do yourself a favor and test drive the Kizashi, due to poor marketing efforts by Suzuki the Kizashi is not known and is not selling very well which gives the buyer good leverage when negotiating a deal, I got mine for $3600 less than the sticker price and I also got 0% financing for 60 months."

After a year of driving it, though, the little annoyances are pushing me toward trading it. Little things like a radio with an already limited range losing the station a lot. The low tire pressure warning takes over the dashboard but doesn't indicate which tire. 

The rounded shape of the dash and hood make it difficult for someone of my height (5'5"") to judge how close the front end of the car is to something. Because it's so low to the ground, it's either get out and look or risk damaging the car because it won't clear most curbs."

I've had this car for 5 years, with not one, mechanical issue.... Never had to utilize the warranty for anything.... Only thinking of selling car because the 5 year bumper to bumper warranty I purchased runs out in December, 2016.... Couple that with the unfortunate fact that Suzuki no longer produces automobiles for the U.S. market, the dealer network is close to non existent.... (Closest dealer left is 1 1/2 hours drive away.)

suzuki,kizashi,2011,GnemokYaj, 12/07/2019,BEST SEDAN I EVER OWNED!,5,"I love and miss my Suzuki Kizashi! Had I not gotten into an accident with it I would still be driving it today. The response and performance was beyond expectations. The build and quailty was the best in its class. Since the car was such a rare sight I always got compliments about its good looks which made it even more enjoyable to drive. If only Suzuki had stay in the states I'd be all over this car with every generation they'd produce.

suzuki,kizashi,2012,unclerolly, 11/27/2012,Snap one up while you can,4,"I had a 2004 BMW 330XI that was killing me in repair costs.
I went back and forth on the Kizashi for so long and I'm glad I finally pulled the trigger.
After six weeks of ownership I have really enjoyed he car.
Distinctive exterior styling, plush, comfortable interior, fun to drive, great build quality.
The car is so well engineered and it's clear a lot of thought went into everything right down to the tactile feedback of control buttons on the steering wheel and center stack console.
Normally you have to spend at least twice this much money to drive something so rare.
Don't get me wrong this is not a high end Mercedes or an exotic but it's a lot of car for under $30k that nobody has."
suzuki,kizashi,2012,Bob, 02/05/2016,This car has been absolutely wonderful!,5,"You cant buy these cars new. I have 105550 miles on my 2012. I haven't changed a thing except the oil/filter, tires and rear brakes. I plan on driving it to 300000 miles.

suzuki,kizashi,2012,bigjohn23, 01/16/2015,135 000 km review (best car ever owned),5,"The Suzuki Kizashi is a very good looking car inside and out. I then started to look at the specs and wow...it had a lot of features (especially for the price and the iAWD system). Not even a single problem so far. The only complaints is the wipers are not the best and the gas mileage could be better, but I mean it is a heavy car that does not get stuck in any snow/ice. It has a wonderful Rockford Fosgate audio system and you can put it front-wheel drive or intelligent all-wheel drive whenever you want with a push of a button. I had 2 Audi A4 Quattro in the past and the Kizashi handles even better. It is basically an A4 (same features, same look), but a lot cheaper and more RELIABLE. You won't regret it!

Update (July 2016/62 000 km) : Still the best car I ever owned....incredible in the snow! Very reliable, comfortable, etc. The audio system is awesome. I did not change anything besides the original tires, the rear rotors and all the breaks.

Update (June 2018/100 000 km) : No issue to report. Thinking about my next car (4-5 years from now probably), but I still love my Kizashi!

Update (December 2018/110 000 km) : Replaced shocks at 105 000 km. Still an awesome car.

Update (December 2019/130 000 km) : Still love my Kizashi! Replaced rear bushings since last update.

Update (July 2020/135 000 km) : Still running strong. Had to replace original battery and original windshield washer pump (rust) recently.

I was initially at the dealership for issues with my HHR, so I had time to kill and here I am! The salesman went with me and had me drive on a really
curvy country road out here in Kansas...Man did I have a good time!!!We then hit the Interstate back to the dealer...I did a cool 75 mph..til we passed two State Troopers,then I stepped on it....We were at 115 mph before I knew it! I backed off though,don't want a ticket! Well anyway,I bought after reading all the reviews here in Edmunds and decided that I have to have this car. But I will keep posting...."
suzuki,kizashi,2012,ggms16, 08/17/2012,Excellent car. Nothing better for the price,4,"I've owned and still own a few late Mercedes and Bmw's Even with my german cars experience, I can definitely say THIS CAR IS AWESOME!. Period!

Yes, a few flaws, there are no perfect cars anywhere. but for the price you pay, the thing is amazing.

Suspension: PERFECT

Brakes: ONE OF THE BEST BRAKES I EVER TESTED

Driving dynamics: I won't say its a BMW or a Mercedes, but its close, its wayyyyy over what you get from Toyota or Honda, but its still not a BMW... The price isn't either.

Steering: Precise and sporty, love it.!"
suzuki,kizashi,2012,jaydee11, 08/26/2012,Still smiling!!,4,"I
only stopped at the dealer for an appointment for an oil change for my Chevy HHR.The next thing I know, I bought a Kizashi!! I love browsing the lots,so my Chevy dealer is also a Suzuki dealer. And there it was! Tucked in between a bunch of Chevys, a black Kizashi. He says how do you feel about this one? It looks nice I said.""Would you like for me to get the keys?"" I said yeah,sure. But if I get the keys, you'll have to test drive it! Yeah,whatever I said. MAn, did I have a ball!! He went with me and showed me a twisty backroad which I never knew existed! God does that baby handle great!! I
thought it was the AWD version,that's how great it felt! "
suzuki,kizashi,2012,Ren, 05/16/2019,Beware of the CVT transmission :(,1,"This car was one of the first cars with the push-to-start technology, before that technology was hashed out, so while I had this car, dozens of times I was faced with a car that wouldn't start because of a dashboard error code causing the on/off engine button to not operate. This was very frustrating but other than this quark I loved this car. BUT...after about 3 months of owning the car the entire transmission went out. All of the quotes, including sourcing a used one, were more than I bought the car for so the car was essentially totaled. I have owned cars with conventional automatic transmissions my whole life and have never had a transmission problem, this was my first CVT car, and within 3 months the transmission goes out. Beware of the CVT version of this car. If CVT's aren't perfectly and properly maintained they'll just go out on you. I put 1 star reviews on anything relating to the car operating, because this car is currently sitting in a junk yard. Very sad because if this car just had a normal automatic transmission I'm betting this little 4 cylinder motor would have ran just fine for ages. I loved the little button this car had to turn it from FWD to AWD. Loved the sound system, loved the seats, loved the styling. Too bad.

Why did they phase out a good line of cars (still sold in Japan)? ... some serious concerns for recalls ... Some concerns over transmission slippage, too ... but it is a relatively well priced sedan which looks really smart ... lots of comments!  Even the commercials they had for this car were terrible!

suzuki,kizashi,2013,CarMark, 02/23/2020,A spectacularly underrated luxury sedan,5,"This is primarily my wife's daily driver, and we thoroughly love it.  We bought it with low miles and have put about 100,000 miles on it in the past five years.  It's been 100% reliable.  Other than routine maintenance (oil changes, air filters, and brakes once), we've only had a single issue... and that turned out to be our fault.  The front differential started dripping some fluid and we couldn't sort it out.  The dealer changed the seals under warranty, and it kept leaking.  It turned out the front passenger wheel had been significantly bent in a pot hole and was shaking the front differential so hard that it was leaking.  We replaced the bent wheel, and the leak was gone.  So, I blame us for that, not the car.  The interior is luxurious (nicer than my dad's BMW or my Mercedes), and everyone that rides in it comments on the quality of the leather (contrast stitching) and the comfort of the front seats.  It is superb for long trips; we never experience back fatigue.  The chassis of the car is overbuilt too.  It has truly superb handling that could easily support a couple hundred more horsepower.  The chassis reminds me of the sports cars I've owned... taut and grippy.  That being said, we've never felt that the stock 185hp was too little.  The Kizashi came with more standard horsepower than all the base model sedans in the segment.  A turbo or V6 option would have been a nice upgrade, but the 2.4 is a very decent little engine.  Acceleration is a little deceptive since the smooth CVT makes it feel slower than it actually is.  The CVT isn't my favorite (I prefer manuals), but my wife genuinely likes it.  The 2013 had a slight CVT redesign versus the 2010-2012 models; it's never given us any issues, and we're pushing 130k miles on it.  I have changed the fluid and 2 filters in it once at 100k (and I suggest others do the same at 100k or whenever the fluid color starts changing).  It'll whine a little when you drive up a mountain for a few hours in 90F degree heat, but it's been entirely reliable just like virtually everything else on the car.  The only thing that's ""failed"" was the poorly-designed USB outlet.  It can literally be pushed into the dashboard if you plug something in too hard.  I modified the replacement USB outlet's retention tabs with a touch of epoxy, and the problem is fixed.  Oh, I did read about a lot of Kizashi owners needing to replace their headlight bulbs frequently.  So, rather than face that possibility, I just bought an HID kit and installed it (so no problems there, and the lights are bright and beautiful).  The Edmunds review bullets indicate mediocre fuel mileage, but I would disagree.  In 2010 when the car was released, this was the second most fuel efficient AWD vehicle in America (second only to the smaller Suzuki SX4).  It's no Prius, but for a solidly-built AWD sedan, it's very decent (easily over 30mpg on the highway).  Don't forget that this only requires regular fuel too; a lot of the competitors require premium fuel to reach their mileage ratings.  We're saving plenty of money on gas versus the Honda CRV this replaced (despite the CRV being a lighter vehicle).  If I can find a low mileage one, I will absolutely buy another when the time comes to replace this one.  Yes, the dealer options stink since Suzuki is gone from the US, but I'm not a huge fan of dealers anyway.  I'd rather let a skilled independent work on my cars.  Or better yet, get a supremely reliable car like the Kizashi and no one needs to work on it.  This is an attractive luxury sedan with solid performance, excellent reliability, and high safety ratings.  It's hard to think of any real complaints on it.  I will say that based on the car's terrific performance in snow, the AWD may have been an unnecessary option... the FWD version of the car is probably what I would buy next time (just to save weight and fuel).  Snow has never
 been an issue, and my wife frequently forgets to turn the AWD option on during inclement weather anyway.  My wife hates it when we rent cars now, because all the new 2020 Kia, Hyundai, Nissan, Chevy and Toyota rental sedans are dull and uncomfortable compared to her beloved ""Kizzy.""  Highly recommended.   I hope Suzuki figures out how to return to America one day... and makes more cars like this.

suzuki,reno,2005,Patrick, 08/26/2009,Deceptive Warranty,2,"I purchased this vehicle in hopes of getting an inexpensive dependable commuter car.When driving home one evening the car quit on the interstate.The car was under warranty so I wasnt worried.I sat in the dealership the entire next day? After a couple of weeks the dealership called and said the serpentine belt broke and caused the timing belt to jump time, ruining the engine.The icing on the cake is that Suzuki refused to cover it under warranty because the serpentine belt is not covered and according to Suzuki it caused the engine to blow up.I disputed called protested, it didnt matter, that warranty is a teaser, they never expect to honor it.The dealership wanted $7800.00 for a new engine"
suzuki,reno,2005,DC, 08/27/2005,Why I DIDN'T get a Reno,3,"Although I was impressed with the Reno LX's ride, features, performance, and quiet cabin, the following items turned me away.  1. Very weak AC, which I found in all three Renos I drove. Sub-par at best.  2. Poorly designed sunroof operation, with no ""one-touch"" closing, requiring you to keep a finger on the button and your eyes on the sunroof as it closes, meaning having to take your eyes off the road to make sure it stops and seals where it should instead of going into vent mode. Frustrating, and a safety hazard while driving.  3. Tight rear storage. Not enough lateral room for my guitar cases without putting seatbacks down. That means no passengers.  4. Sub-par gas mileage  No thanks."
suzuki,reno,2005,redsox8191, 12/30/2005,Great Little Car,4,"My Suzuki Reno is the second Suzuki I have owned.  I also currently own an XL-7.  I LOVE this car.  The interior is set up great and there is plenty of room for me and the kids.  The sound system rocks and the ride is as smooth as silk.  The braking with the 4 disk brakes is sharp and the speed sensitive steering is awesome...especially in parking lots etc.  The only knock I have so far is the gas mileage isn't great.  Hopefully that will improve as the car gets broken in better.  I highly recommend this vehicle to those looking for a small reliable car!  You can't beat the 7 year / 100,000 mile warranty either!"
suzuki,reno,2005,The Newlyweds, 12/16/2005,Great on a Budget,4,"We recently purchased a new 2005 Suzuki Reno.  We are very pleased with our purchase.  We love how quiet and relaxing it was to drive/ride in.  The gas mileage is pretty good (30mpg).  We also own a '97 Geo Metro so we're big on gas mileage.  We were complaining about wanting more room on longer trips and wanting 4 doors.  So we very pleased with the roomy interior, safety features, and the hatchback style.  The cargo room is something we have been wanting more of and we are thrilled!  We can't wait to go on our first camping trip!"
suzuki,reno,2005,T Moores, 09/20/2006,Almost Perfect,4,"I've been driving my Reno for just over a year.  The more I drive the more I respect this car. What's not to like?  Consumer Reports doesen't like it. I used CR for years to research items. Their review of this car is wayy off.  This is a darn good commuter vehicle. It's solid, safe, has a comfy ride, and is nice to look at.  The warranty is one of the best things about it."

For a ""cheaper"" value car, man does this top expectations.
Has rigidity of a honda body (not so much paint finish though).
The most standard features for a better price than any car in its class and best acceleration in class (manual).
And this is compared to 2005 compact vehicles.
Not best on gas, but fun to drive.
I will def. put suzuki and Sx4 on my short list.
Don't let people tell you they're crap...one of the highest selling cars in the world just not as popular in USA."

My computer has been reset twice already! Then my head lights went... an electrical problem. Also the paint is completely gone off my back fenders! My dealership repainted this once and they refuse to do it again. All the paint had chipped off because of the design. "
suzuki,reno,2005,shelby, 04/07/2016,Ive had this car since my 16th birthday!!!,4,"Overall this has been an incredible little car, especially as a first vehicle. I can turn on a dime, parallel park like a boss and theres plenty of room. I used this car to move into an RV for a few months and all of my clothes/personals including my mountain bike AND 80lb dog fit into this little car. Not gonna say it was the epitome of comfort but I would definitely do it again. 

This car gets great gas mileage, especially if you aren't one to accelerate and then brake heavily (about 26mpg on average). There have been some recalls on the headlights but Suzuki fixes it all for free (this has happened twice in he past 5 or so years). 

I replaced the original stereo with a Kenwood, and now I can plug in any USB/AUX and it charges my phone simultaneously. I only gave the technology 3 stars because I use my phone for all that (navigation/bluetooth) and didn't want to skew the rating unfairly.

suzuki,reno,2005,Charley, 12/05/2004,Reno....not broken in yet,4,"I just got my Reno and am pleased. A few things need to be changed but overall it's a great car. The main selling point of any Suzuki is the warranty.  You can't beat 7 year/100,000 miles.  Plus, if you are a loyal customer to the dealer for your services, you get free tires as long as you own it.  For a base model, it has a lot more than any other base model you can get.  We were looking for budget...and that's what we got.  But this is by far the best bang for your buck as far as dependability goes.  Power isn't all there.  My '92 prelude puts the Reno to shame in that aspect.  But all in all it's a nice car with a lot of benefits you shouldn't pass up if you're on a budget."

As for the cars power, you would accually think this car had a larger engine. I've got the 5speed Manual. the only real downfall I've noticed is pedal spacing. I have trouble hitting 2 pedals at once. All in all, I'm pleased. This is a far cry better than getting 9 - 13/mpg in my full-sized conversion van.

I purchased the car and everyone I know has fallen in love with it and what makes it even better is the people at the dealership. I'm already looking for another Suzuki for my wife.
suzuki,reno,2005,NancyH, 02/08/2005,Nothing Special,3,"This is a great car if you live in a state with little snow, and don't mind the terrible gas mileage.  While it is fun to drive, had I known these two factors were as bad as they are I would't have bought this car.  Also there is no good place to store cd's and the glove compartment is tiny."
suzuki,reno,2005,kuzuki reno, 02/22/2005,So nice!!!!,4,I love this car. It drives so smooth.  I had one car on my mind for the last year and well it was not this car but when I saw it i had to test drive it and fell in love with it.
suzuki,reno,2005,Jacqueline Range, 03/23/2005,Reno 2005,4,The vehicle is very easy to handle on the road. Drives smooth. Not a very big car but plenty of room. Great looks. Two thumbs up!
suzuki,reno,2005,Saverio, 05/10/2005,Smart Package,4,"You couldn't find a better car for less money than the Suzuki Reno. It has all the fixings of a luxury car at an economic price. If you like that go test drive one, pt for the manual transmission.  You won't be sorry."
suzuki,reno,2005,Dave, 06/06/2005,Great Car,4,"I love my car, its fun to drive and looks good as well."
suzuki,reno,2005,Johana Flores, 06/21/2005,The best car ever!,5,"I've had this vehicle for about seven months, and they have been great! The car handles beautifully and I love the sound of the engine reving up. In the city I cant drive so fast but on a recent trip to Las Vegas I had fun! Handles curves nicely, great on inclines, and great mileage for gas! "
suzuki,reno,2005,Buy it !!!, 07/29/2005,"Great Car, Buy it!",5,"OK guys here's the story and the word from someone who knows.  Listen up, this is a fantastic car.  It has tons of standard upgrades that other cars makers charge an arm and a leg for. It handles great, looks very European and very cool, and it comes with a CD/MP3 player 8 speaker system - standar ! I highly recommend getting the 5-speed manual transmission over automatic. The manual will give you more power, more control, and it's a heck of lot quieter than the automatic. Take my word for it, you'll love the car.  I looked at the Honda Civic, Hyundai, and the Scion tC; and The Suzuki Reno beats them all hands down. The quality is second to none. That's the story and the word."
suzuki,reno,2005,tikirob, 08/03/2005,Great Car,4,This car has been great. The ride is quite an smooth and the build quility is high.  The seats are very comfortable.
suzuki,reno,2005,Beverly O., 02/17/2006,"Reno - Good Car, Little Money",4,"I was apprehensive about buying a small car such as the Reno, but after test driving the Kia Rio and then the Suzuki Reno I was assured that the Reno was the car for me.  The Reno out-performed the Rio with its acceleration, comfort, noise level and cost!  I love my little Reno. It would be just perfect if only it got a wee bit better gas mileage for its size."
suzuki,reno,2005,psgibas, 03/01/2007,Buyer Beware,2,"This car is not only poor when it comes to fuel economy, but the technical problems I had with it go beyond my apprehension. I had major work done on it TWICE since my late 2005 purchase.  I will not recommend this car to anyone, spend extra couple of grand and get something better."
suzuki,reno,2005,Saverio, 11/13/2007,Good Car,4,"I have owned this vehicle since February of 2005. It now has over 31,000 miles. It has been great. I put new tires on it 2000 miles ago. I opted for wider tires and it has improved its handling."
suzuki,reno,2005,jayqohardd, 02/04/2012,Best small car!,3,"So my best friend has had her Reno since 2005 so over the years road trips have been abundant!
This car is sooo much fun!! I love it more than anything. I am actually about to by an LX for my commute to and from work. The reliability is beyond expectation, I mean, we have put over 200,000 miles on it in 7 years!
She just keeps going. Now, the bad thing is that the stereo system in the doors went out quickly, the fact you have to push down to shift from Drive to park, etc.. has made the shifter loose & you have to press the shift towards the driver to make sure it locks in when turning off the vehicle. Other than that I cannot complain!"
suzuki,reno,2006,dora5, 05/17/2012,2006 Suzuki Reno,4,"I purchased my car in 2011 at 48,000 miles, and the biggest problem is that it isn't good on gas. 

Also, I was told by a mechanic at a a Goodyear Service Center two days ago that I might need struts, rack and pinion work and rods!!! Even though the car was given a clean bill of health just six months ago, and only has 52,000 miles on it. Today, I went to the Suzuki authorized service center and they said I don't need anything but an alignment and new wipers. They thought the struts where getting dry, but not a problem. Seems to me Goodyear wanted to make a little money.

To be safe, I am taking it to a third shop just in case. Luckily, I purchased an extended warranty."
suzuki,reno,2006,Renee', 07/13/2010,Okay Car for the Money,3,"I bought this car used.  I have not had to do anything to it except oil changes and standard maintenance stuff.  It's almost time to replace the tires.  The price of the standard tires was higher than I expected.  Every tire place I went to said they were not a size they stocked, so that was surprising.  But overall, I really like the car so far.  Have not had any mechanical issues.  The main thing is to remember it is an inexpensive car, don't expect it to drive like a Mercedes or you're setting yourself up for disappointment.  But great car, glad we bought it."
suzuki,reno,2006,John, 11/22/2006,Nothing but Trouble from the Start,2,"I bought this Reno new and since day ""two"" it's been nothing but trouble.  The second day it left us stranded and wouldn't start.  The dealer towed it back said it was fixed.  We got six miles from dealer it stopped again.  The dealer had it for six days returned it said it was all fixed.  Then three days later the same thing happened, it wouldn't start.  The dealer had it again and replaced more parts.  It runs now, but gets poor fuel economy - only 20 mpg in the city.  Yesterday my wife started it, turned on heater, and it sounded like a bomb went off.  There was some acorns packed in heater.  We called dealer and he said it was not their problem.  I took it apart and there is NO screen over the heater motor under hood and it was full of nuts.  The tranny still doesn't shift right.  I will never buy another Suzuki.  It is the worst car I have ever bought!"
suzuki,reno,2006,Wunderly, 12/18/2009,Great Car for a Low Price,3,"I bout this car used at 4600 miles for about 6 grand at an auto auction.  I have had this car for almost a year and I have have no problems with it so far, engine is easy to maintain.  one issue is that the dashboard can glare on to the windshield, but other then that small detail the car is a good one to own for high school and college age kids."
suzuki,reno,2006,CableGuy30, 07/17/2010,2nd Reno and would buy again,4,"Ok. So I see all these bad reviews on here, and dealing with the public I know more people complain than compliment. So here goes my story. This is my second Reno. First one had for 9 months, 27,000 miles. No problems. Until it got totaled when got hit by a semi truck. I walked away from the wreck. This one now has 76,000 miles and no problems. The a/c is poor, but tint the Windows and that takes care of 2 things at once. Makes the car look even better and helps the a/c. I wish they still made this car cause I would buy another one. "
suzuki,reno,2006,Sansaloo, 12/04/2015,Worst mistake of my life,2,"Bought this car and an emergency car in January 2014 after I totaled my last car. Car was great for 5 months when the check engine came on. Turns out it was the throttle body,  which was no longer made. Dealt with it for another year and few months before everything started going wrong. Lower control arms needed replaced, quickly followed by having to replace the entire shifter assembly.  Both front and rear struts need replaced, including the mounting and stabilizers. Rack and pinions are starting to leak, has to replace a oil gasket, and now the throttle position sensor is shot. Only a dealer can calibrate a new one, and you have to replace the whole throttle body, not just the sensor. Only 69100 miles on this car, it shouldn't have all these issues!
"
suzuki,reno,2006,SMR, 02/08/2006,Pretty Fun Little Car so Far,4,"So I have only had my 2006 Suzuki Reno for about two weeks but it has been pretty impresive for the money. Let's face it, it's a cheap mode of transport. But it's got some class that's for sure. I think the Italian design really helps. To me it looks better than cars out there that cost twice as much. It's very European looking.  It could be that the car is actually a Holden Viva from Australia which was basically rebadged as a Suzuki.  Overall I have been quite impressed by this stylish little guy. If you like the little European cars (like I do), then you won't be dissapointed.   Test drive one and I think you will see what I mean."
suzuki,reno,2006,Tony123, 06/03/2006,Reno-The most overlooked compact,4,"Suzuki makes a great car. The build quality, fit and finish a reliability challenge the best compacts out there. But it seems that the rest of the world sees Suzuki's as ""bottom of the barrel"" cars. This is definitely not true. I have been so pleased with my Reno. My gas mileage is better then what the sticker stated. I average 32-34 mpg with local driving. The car is extremely roomy and comfortable. The transmission is smooth and easy-maybe not as refined as a Sentra or Corolla - but better than any Focus, Cobalt or Elantra. I just bought my wife an XL-7, she loves it. If you like the European style and the practical benefits of a hatchback, test drive a Reno-you will be pleasantly surprised."
suzuki,reno,2006,Tabitha Harmon, 09/25/2006,Horrible Experience,1,"I bought this car to have a dependable vehicle.  It has had so many problems.  I have had it in the shop for the transmission (5x), the washer fluid box (2x), the air bag (1x), the windshield wipers (2x), and the AC (5x).  Every time, the dealership promises the car is fixed, but it certainly is not.  Now they are saying they are not going to pay to have the AC fixed because they claim a mouse has gotten in it.  Yet, they have no proof of this.  I'm really getting fed up with Suzuki."
suzuki,reno,2006,aaron98762001, 12/14/2013,I dont get it,4,"I've been reading reviews and not one was good. My reno will fly, i read one that said it had trouble keeping up in traffic. To be a 2.0 this car is fast, i believe very dependable. I've had no trouble,
it's a little rough on gas. But alot better than my 6 cylinder."
suzuki,reno,2006,Shauna, 08/07/2016,2006 Suzuki Reno,3,"I got an '06 Reno in October of '15. It had 51k miles. I was surprised to find that this vehicle did not have cruise control, as many older vehicles (different make) do. The mpgs are not very good, even when using high octane fuel and keeping maintenance regular (correct air pressure in tires, clean air filter, oil changes ever 3k miles). I've already had to replace the head gasket in the engine. Come to find out there was an air bag/warranty issue for Renos, that effect/affect mine, according to the VIN. Not sure if it was the best choice, but I needed a car. It's still good, just think that an '06 vehicle, regardless of who it's from, should have cruise control. According to good 'ol Google, '06 Renos get 20 city and 28 highway.

suzuki,reno,2006,Tony, 06/05/2006,Great Car for the Money,4,"I just purchased this car because of its looks and how it drives, On the road all you see these days is Hondas and Toyotas I wanted to be diffrent and bought a Reno.  The car is very spacious and very confortable, it rides well too."
suzuki,reno,2006,Jena, 05/22/2010,The worst car ever!,2,"I purchased my vehicle in 2007. I hate it. It only has 3,000. miles on it. My transmission is failing, the air bag light is on, and engine light is on too. I called Suzuki to help me. But I have to pay for everything to see what's wrong and most thing aren't covered. It doesn't start always. I have 2 children and i am unemployed at this time. They told me that only interior thing are covered under warranty until 100,000 miles. The transmission is not shifting right and it jerks when it shifts. Gas not so good. I called corporate and they couldn't help me either. Not worth the money. Too many problems. And its not only me. What should I do."
suzuki,reno,2006,Ed, 10/18/2010,Piece of junk,2,"I purchased this car in 2006. Since then its been in the shop at least 6 times. I've had major issues with the transmission sensor. When the sensor goes bad the car does not move. I was driving this car to work at the speed limit of 50, then I had to stop for a light, when I was taking off the check engine light came on and the car had almost no power. If I knew then what I know now I would have opted for a better car. I would never purchase another Suzuki. I guess you get what you pay for. Oh and getting rid of it is much more difficult considering its worthless."
suzuki,reno,2006,JP007, 11/15/2006,Under the Shadow,4,"While overshadowed by bigger names such as the Toyota Scion series, Mazda, Honda, and others, the Suzuki Reno stands as the under dog. With ""European Styling"", a comfortable and spacious interior,a fun driving experience, and an affordable price tag, the Suzuki Reno is perfect for the average college student or young person. The Reno is an all-around fun car, and you wont be embarrassed to show it off to your friends. I would suggest the Suzuki Reno to anyone in the market for a very nice and practical new car."
suzuki,reno,2006,Good & Bad, 06/20/2008,Some Quirks,4,"To start, let me say I really do love this car.  But, it has had many problems that make it annoying at times. I had the problem with it not starting for the 1st 6mo I had it-the dealership could never fix it but it stopped happening. Then I had an airflow problem (scary)- The tires wore out (low profile)at 24000. And, I've had non-stop issues with the airbag sensor, that they just can't seem to fix. I was just told that it would probably need a new Serp. belt soon. But, the car is fun to drive, sporty, decent on mpg. MPG could be better for a car this size, but It's better than an SUV! If you know how to drive the automatic as a manual (as you can in this car) really gets up and goes. "
suzuki,reno,2006,BK, 07/14/2008,So far - so good,4,"We have 30,000 miles on our Reno and have not had it in the shop yet. It starts easily and is pretty good on fuel. I drive 40 miles round trip to work and run a few errands around town in it.  It is a manual 5 speed and we average 35 miles per gallon consistantly around town. The air is pretty weak and living in Florida can be a bit frustrating. Overall, we have been pleased but we are holding our breath. We also owned a Suzuki Verona at the same time that was a nightmare - we finally got rid of it, thank God."
suzuki,reno,2006,Kat, 01/09/2009,Bad Car,1,"This is the worst car I have ever owned. I started having problems when it was only a few weeks old. It took forever to get the problem fixed. Then the car had the head light not working problem. Then my front drivers seat came disconnected from the base. The tires wore out in under a year. The check engine light keeps coming on for no reason. The mileage is not good for that small a car. I was just told that I already need to replace the rear breaks. The service from Suzuki is bad. They knew about the starter problem when I called and told me they were working on a fix, I would just have to wait. I only had the car for less then a month. It is a bad, bad, bad car. I used to love Suzuki."
suzuki,reno,2006,K. payne, 02/27/2009,"They ""Got"" me!!",2,"we purchased our reno right after we got married as a 2nd car, boy what a mistake we made.  I think the car stayed in the shop more than we drove it; head light continues to go out for now reason, airbag light on, dealer don't know why, no good a/c heater output, replaced tires under a year, middle console will not close and we had to the timing belt in less than a year.  This car is a piece of crap, can't trade cause it's worth nothing.  Biggest mistake we ever made"
suzuki,reno,2006,PSJ, 04/24/2009,"No problems in 30,000 Miles",3,Love the car. Got what I expected which was reliable service with no a problem to date at 30 thousand miles. Car has good vision fields and ride is tight and solid but it is a small car ride so if you think you're getting a Lexus at this price wakeup... although with all the radio and cruise controls on the steering wheel you will feel like you got more than you paid for.

suzuki,reno,2006,Harvester, 05/16/2009,Reliable Little Buggy for 2 Years Now,3,"This has to be one of the best deals I've ever gotten on a used car. Bought  it less than a year old, with 8500 miles.  The cost was already 2/3 of a new one.  All the complaints I've read about have never happened to me.  There were 3 recalls that the Suzuki dealer performed - one for a wiring harness, one for a seatbelt thing, and the other for the running lights.  I took this car on a road trip across Texas and back and was very good on gas.  For $200 I put a Pioneer radio and it made all the difference in the world.  The speakers are actually very nice sounding if you put some wattage behind them."
suzuki,reno,2006,Jamin, 11/17/2009,Underrated Commuter Superstar!,4,"I work as a salesperson in the car business and I drive a variety of cars and trucks on a daily basis. Some are nicer, faster, bigger, and tow better than others. For me, this vehicle works. I work downtown and I needed a small, reliable commuter that was reasonable on gas but still fun to drive. This car delivers. I bought it with just over 40k miles on it and so far have had no problems. The flat torque curve of this engine allows it to pull even in 5 gear which is unusual for a car this size. I went with an 8 for reliability due to my short ownership. The car handles like a go-cart and winds up nicely. I paid 6k used (it's a 2006)- (a deal a customer could have gotten) Value-wise-- 10!"
suzuki,reno,2006,dk676, 12/28/2009,Worst car ever buyers beware,1,I purchased my car because i needed a four door due to having a child & i wish i never had! I had over $600 in work done and was told it should help the gas mileage it made it worse. Now they tell me its normal. They dont tell you about recalls until you call for other issues or hear about it from someone else. I had the transmission replaced & that took over two weeks & 2 different transmissions. The dealer never called me i had to call them to check on the car. My brother also has one and he has had his in the shop more than he gets to drive it.  My suggestion is dont ever buy a suziki they are the biggest piece of crap ever made & they dont care as long as you are making your payments! 
suzuki,reno,2006,Ev, 04/23/2006,A great overlooked runabout,4,"It's easy to miss the Suzuki Reno. It is overshadowed by the heavily promoted Scions, Toyotas and Hondas, little Suzuki is well, little known. I hadn't heard of the Reno until I saw one at the auto show, and was immediatly drawn to it. After an hour of test driving it, the Reno sits in front of my apartment. Aside from the obsurity of the car, what really sets the Reno apart is the amazing level of standard equipmet. My base model came with side airbags, power windows, locks and mirrors, steering assist, 8 speaker am/fm/cd/tape, and of course the European insired hatch design. My only complaint is the gas mileage is not up to the standards of the class (see Honda Fit, Scion xA, etc). "
suzuki,reno,2006,tiffany, 05/04/2006,Not too Shabby,3,"I bought this car new after months of looking online at CPO / used cars.  I actually got it for well below invoice price, which was one major reason that I purchased it.  I am pleasantly surprised by the quality and performance of it.  The interior is simple yet stylish, and has plenty of room.  The exterior is a sleek, European hatchback look.  There are great features included for the price.  I am actually pretty happy with my purchase.  The only thing I am disappointed in is the fuel economy.  A car this small should be able to get more than 22 mpg (city).  My '03 Honda Civic gets 29 mpg."
suzuki,reno,2006,JC, 06/08/2006,The Most Power and Style for the Money,5,"The Reno is a great car with Italian design. It has more power than the Toyota Yaris, Honda Fit, Scion xA or XB, and the Chevrolet Aveo. It has more standard features and a longer warranty as well. I bought this car for well below invoice. I love this car. You can not find a better value.  Compare it piece by piece to the others and you will see. "
suzuki,reno,2006,JING, 07/25/2006,Quality Car,5,"The Suzuki Reno has a great air conditioner, it's cold air at start-up, and tinted windows, something the other small cars do not seem to have. These things have a lot of value in the Southwest desert. It runs smoothly and is very quiet at and above the posted speed limit on the highway. The seats are comfortable and the audio is great.   It comes standard with 4 wheel disc brakes and good sized 15"" tires."
suzuki,reno,2006,parul, 03/03/2006,I Love this Car,5,"The Suzuki Reno is a perfect car for students, couples and singles. If you are in the market for a coupe...go for this one.  It looks neat and small, but it's actually spacious inside has more room for tall people. It is very smooth.  You don't even feel it when you are going 80 miles an hour.  Its brakes are good. What else do you need in a vehicle that costs less than $15,000.  Rather then buying a used vehicle, buy a Suzuki Reno."

It comes standard with a ton of features for the price and I must say that it is a great value. It looks beautiful from both the inside and outside. It runs better than a Honda Civic. It's so smooooooooooooooooooooth, you gotta' drive it to feel that. If you don't want to take my word for it, go out and give it a try.  I'm sure you'll thank me. "
suzuki,reno,2006,EC Transplant, 03/16/2006,What the VW's GTI should be.,4,"I bought this car as a replacement to my 2000 VW. Value for the money, you can't beat this car.  No problems whatsoever.  I have entered this car in several autocross events and it has shamed cars costing at least twice as much.  The styling is distinctive and euro, a nice touch.  Interior is simple, the way I like it with just the right amount of convenience such as power windows, mirrors, and locks.  Although the car's suspension is soft (see below), the overall balance is great.  If Suzuki can bump the car up to about 150 bhp and stiffen up the suspension at least 50% the car would be a hit with hot hatch enthusiasts everywhere."
suzuki,reno,2006,B E, 03/22/2006,A Great Overlooked European Designed Car,4,"When I came home with the Suzuki Reno, most people asked ""What is that?"" The first comment made by most people is ""It looks very European.""  It truly is one of those cars that makes an appearnce in every French film. This car is a hidden treasure, consider that power windows, locks, mirrors, an am/fm/cd/ tape palyer, heated mirrors and side airbags all come standard on the base model! The 5 speed manual transmission is smooth, buttery, and matched to the 1.8 liter engine makes for a peppy little car!"
suzuki,reno,2006,David, 07/28/2006,I Love the Little Car,4,"I looked at the Reno as a way to save gas money and miles on my ""toy"" that is horible on gas and was racking up too many miles.  I like the usefulness of the hatch, the features, and best of all the price.  I have not had any real problems with the car with the exception of a computer reflash that fixed the idle problem.  I hit it a bit on performance (see below), but the car is fun to drive and performs up to expectations and then sum when compared to the direct competition.  I still like to drive my expensive sports car, but don't miss it too much on comutes in the reno.  Oh, its gas milage is realy good.  I keep track of it.  I geuss Suzuki doesn't overblow the numbers like most do."
suzuki,reno,2006,Cris, 10/14/2006,Don't buy this car!,1,"The Suzuki Reno is totally unreliable. After I had the car for just five days, I began to have problems starting my 2006 Reno every morning. After two and a half weeks with the car in the shop, I was put in a 2007 Reno, which developed hard start issues, again in five days. In both cars, the passenger airbag off light stayed illuminated regardless of my having a passenger. The dealer put me back in the original Reno, claiming its been fixed, which I do not trust yet. Suzuki never returns my phone calls. Their customer service is non-existent. If I could get them to void my contract, I would and I would never again buy a Suzuki or recommend one to anyone, even my worst enemy. Dont even consider this car!"
suzuki,reno,2006,knoxvilledavid, 10/26/2006,"Call This a ""Bug""gy",2,"The Reno is a great car if you like getting 20 mpg around town, and cranking the engine multiple times to get her started. I had to crank my '06 two dozen times once trying to go home from work for an appointment. Add to that several trips for service every few days for nine months while Suzuki's ""engineers"" worked out a ""fix."" The ""fix"" should have been to give me a full refund of my money!"

suzuki,reno,2006,russgoble, 08/13/2007,Awesome toy,4,"I bought the car and to be honest with you, stock, the car isn't much, but after putting some 17"" rims, limo tint, a sound system, underglow light, a custom grille and much more, that car has turned into a one of a kind here where I live. The manual has a lot more power than it look like. Adding NOS, turbo chargers, intake, exhaust will really make this car get up and race with the best.  If anyone wants a car at an affordable price that you want to fix up and make unique, then I recommend this car"
suzuki,reno,2006,Robert Garrison, 03/15/2008,Reno's great mileage and Comfort,5,"I kept looking at that Reno sitting up a pedistal outside the dearlership for about a month. The looks and the price was very attractive. I decided to stop and see how the performance was and to tell you the truth. I was actually surprised by what that 2.0 liter will do. If your not afraid to put your foot in it, it will get you down the road quick. Anyway, I am 6'2"" and I fit in that car like Jim Carey says, ""like a glovvvveee"". It handles real well, and the mileage...OMG...I go to Illinois from Alabama and I don't stop for gas until I get to Champagne which is like 450 miles from Huntsville. I love this car. Great car!"

I'm around 6-2ish and I fit comfortably into the vehicle. No knees into the glove box, no hair touching the upholstry on the roor. Has gotten a bit cramped with the addition of a car seat, had to move pass seat forward.  Have not had any major mechanical problems to this point. Have not experienced the bad starting as some others have. Did eat through the factory serp belt though by 36,000. Have flushed the engine cooling system and serviced the auto trans, no problems with the fluid exchanges either. MPG is nothing to totally rave about, but full it once a week, not terrible.   "

Transmission skips like crazy and is a safety hazard.... Visibility is poor out the front but horrible in the back.... listen this car is garbage the bad out weighs the good

suzuki,reno,2007,James, 10/26/2006,I Love It,5,I love it. The Reno is everything that I need and nothing that I don't.  It is spacious for such a small vehicle.  The base level is what I went with and with such an affordable price tag who could pass it up?
suzuki,reno,2007,hikaru_n, 07/30/2014,Lousy car,2,This car is riddled with electrical and sensor problems. Had to get them to replace the headlights. Very bad acceleration and shifting. Probably the worst car I've ever had. It's my fault I didn't do enough research on this car. It was inexpensive and fun to drive but now I'm already really wanting to trade this piece of crap in for a mazda 3 hatchback. Which I should have bought in the first place. TRUST ME DO NOT BUY THIS CAR YOU WILL NOT DRIVE IT!
suzuki,reno,2007,shintaro, 10/16/2008,Awesome Small Car,4,"I had this car for almost 6 motnhs and never had a problem with it. I enjoy driving it and not bad on gas mileage, actually I bought the car to save gas even if I was looking for Chevy Cobalt. The dealer gave me this because the cobalt was a little bit expensive and I have another loan that's why they didn't gave me the Cobalt. Anyway, I didn't regret having this car. And it can fit up to 5 people including driver and you can park anywhere (easy to park) and as most everyone's saying. I did expect to get more than 31+ miles per gallon but I'm only getting 31 on highway and 24 city. And I compared the back seat to a Chevy Impala SS and the Reno was bigger. I like this car"
suzuki,reno,2007,anti_suzuki, 10/19/2011,Reno-Divorce,2,"My quarrel is not with the car, which is built in Korea by Daewoo, but with the service and treatment of the Suzuki dealers.
I have only had two issues with this car in 45,000 miles, but the last one was the last straw.
I was charged $278 to fix a defective $45 electronic sensor.
I watched the mechanic take 15 minutes, but they charged me 45 minutes labor. I told them what was wrong, internet supported common problem, and they charged me an additional $100 to diagnose it.
I am trying to unload the car now and I would caution EVERYONE away from Suzuki cars.
They dowble talk you with big warranties for which you still have to pay if the engine or trans do not fail completely.
Stay Away!"
suzuki,reno,2007,clover5, 01/11/2013,Should have had recalls,1,"I bought mine new and have always had an issue with it having gaps in acceleration. Dealer said nothing wrong. Clutch worn very fast 35 k or so. Dealer said I had to replace I still have not 142 k. My major problem is it has always had poor gas mileage and codes it is not running effiecient. I have replaced the throttle body and sensor since you can't get just the sensor, O2 sensors, plugs
wires etc. It has had all normal and regular maintenence. The ""gaps"" are getting worse and it is not an automatic. The automatic ones just shift gears at any time. No problems with these have ever been a recall. I owned a KIA before and never had any issues. I can see why these cars are gone !"
suzuki,reno,2007,Glenn, 01/12/2007,Good Little Car,4,"So far my Reno has been a good solid car.  I have the manual transmission.  Its power is OK for a car in this class.  The interior is a little uncomfortable, but with an 8-way adjusting driver seat and plenty of front leg room, it's OK. It sounds good, I haven't noticed excessive wind noise yet.  Backing up is a little troublesome. Coming from a Ford Ranger with a very open rear view, it feels a bit claustrophobic looking out the rear window. Overall, at the price I bought it, I'm very satisfied."
suzuki,reno,2007,devbot , 09/16/2008,Love My Reno,4,"I purchased my Reno as a birthday present to myself. I love my car, and how it hasn't broken down yet. I've owned mine for about six months now. The interior is very roomy, and the instrument panel is very simple and logical. Styling is very European, and there's plenty of space in the trunk. My only real complaint about it, is that I wish there were a more powerful engine option. I know this is an economy car, but I really wish that it had like the SX-4 engine option. The suspension could be a little stiffer, I mean it handles well, but I'd like less body roll. Again I know this is an economy car, but sometimes you may have to do some avoidance maneuver."
suzuki,reno,2007,comgetsum, 09/04/2009,great car,4,"I bought my car in April of 07 when I got it it was bone stock I got the blue metallic I've since added 18'wheels intake, exhaust, chip, bigger injectors and ported and polished the intake. Have not had one issue with this car and im a abid street racer I keep up with evos and sti's this is awesome grand stock its very slow but for the money u get lots of standard features **** the Ford Focus there base modek car has crank handles to roll up the Windows. To bad they they dont make the Reno or forenza anymore I think Suzuki was dumb for recalling them."
suzuki,reno,2007,jpcommute, 03/16/2009,Pleasantly Surprised,4,"I recently purchased a 5spd Reno (46K) for a commuter. I drive 90 miles round trip to work, about 90% interstate. The car is better than expected. The editor reviews seem to be a bit harsh. The ride is good, pretty quiet, handling is OK, peppy engine with the 5 spd, no problems merging etc.The standard features are way above the economy class norm. The mpg has been close to advertised, I have ranged between 26-28.5 mpg with an average 25% city 75% hwy driving. Hwy speeds between 70-77 mph. If you are looking for max mpg, look elsewhere, the Reno offers a pretty good package at the current used prices, shop around and get one at trade-in value and you will have a good 1st car or commuter.

suzuki,reno,2007,jperez, 02/01/2007,"Great Car, Great Value",5,"I love it the Reno.  It is small sleek, stylish, has power everything, and costs less than $15,000.  Enough said."
suzuki,reno,2007,Charley Reno, 03/08/2007,Extremely Well Thought Out,4,"The Suzuki Reno is a superb value.  Up and coming Suzuki delivers with just the right formula.  It has unique and attractive styling, in and out.  It also has lots of standard features, pretty darn good stereo CD with four 2-way speakers and four 1"" tweeters (all 8 are door-mounted).  I like its smooth acceleration and seamless shifting.  It has nice 15"" tires with full wheel covers.  I also like the 8-way driver seat plus 3-position lumbar support. It's no hot rod, but for less than $14,000 there's a DOHC 2.0 liter 4-cylinder GM-designed engine that is more than adequate (made in Australia).  Obviously, the gas mileage will not be 33/38 like the tin cans out there get, but 22/30 ain't bad.  Plus, you're getting a lot more car for almost the same price.  Definitely check this one out."
suzuki,reno,2007,Ellen, 09/10/2009,manual transmission,1,"I am not happy at all with the transmission in this car. I am already repairing the clutch. the transmission has too much play and is very finicky  with RPM to get a shift at the right time for ""economy""  I have always driven stick shifts.  I have 48,000 on the car right now, as I commute a good distance to work.  Would not be my choice again. I miss my KIA !!!!"
suzuki,reno,2007,Cris, 10/14/2006,Same Problems As the '06,1,"I was put into a '07 Suzuki Reno after I had hard start issues with the 2006 model after having the car for just five days.  The 07 model developed hard start issues, again after just five days.  The dealer put me back in the 06, which he claims is fixed. This issue first became apparent in the 06 last Spring, although the company has yet to develop a permanent fix. Suzuki claims (through the dealer) that the hard start problem is limited to the 06 and the 07 I got was a fluke. If I could get Suzuki to void my contract, I would and I would never again buy a Suzuki or recommend one to anyone, even my worst enemy.  Dont even consider this car!"
suzuki,reno,2007,SportDog, 01/19/2007,A Good buy Even Better,4,"The Reno has a lot more get up an go than I had expected. On my trip home from the dealer I had stopped for a traffic signal and pulled out when the light changed and was up to 35 mph when I realized I was still in 5th gear. I got 29 mpg on the trip home from the dealer. I decided to drive from home to the top of Whitetop mountain (1,600 ft to 3,100 ft altitude). It went  up the mountain at 40 mph in 5th gear with no feeling of strain or handling problems on the 25 mph curves. When the pavement gave way to gravel and 4 inches of snow I down shifted to 4th gear and slowed down to 35 mpg and zipped past several 4 wheel drive vehicles sitting in the ditches. Mu 49 mpg on the trip was excellent. "
suzuki,reno,2007,Dewalt, 09/23/2007,My Reno,4,"First off, let me tell you that I am one of those guys that races every car I buy.  I am a mechanic as well so I do all my own engine work.  I have modified my Reno with minor modifications and I do pretty well at the track with it.  Because of the type of car that it is no one ever sees it coming and they underestimate it.  It does great on a drag strip but the handling leaves a lot to be desired.  I bought the car for a work vehicle initially but then my curiosity got the better of me and now that I have raced it I am thoroughly impressed with it."
suzuki,reno,2007,blu5092, 05/22/2008,Great bang for the buck,5,"I have this car less than a year and have no issues so far. It is comfortable, quick and good on gas. If you floor it, only then do you suffer poor gas mileage. Sometimes I can't help it since I am so impressed by this small motor. For a 2.0 this car is very fast. For anyone who doesn't want to hurt their wallet, this car beats any toyota that's similar in size. "

suzuki,reno,2007,Jack H, 01/28/2007,"Nice Looking Car, but Keep Looking",1,I bought the Reno because I desperately needed a car.  I should have done more research.  My car has had starting problems many times.  It also gets terrible gas mileage for a compact car.  I average about 21 mpg with city and highway driving.  A friend has an '06 Impala that gets 30 mpg with a V6 engine.  The seats are a little uncomfortable and the manual transmission is terrible.  How much would a decent linkage cost Suzuki to put in.  The engine is also underpowered.  I am considering trading in the car for a Cobalt since the reviews that I have read about it are quite good.

The options it comes with are great am, fm, cd player front and rear wipers, easy controls. Just a lot for a little.  I have owned a Focus in the past and there is a lot in this car that the Focus didn't have for the price. And the warranty, well that itself almost sold me the car. "
suzuki,reno,2008,Don, 05/27/2008,Better than experts say it is,4,I just purchased this vehicle but thought it odd there were no reviews from users on this vehicle (expert reviews are unkind). It truly is a bargain and drove every bit as well as a Ford Focus. Yes it is basic but for $240 a month for 60 months and 0 down how can you go wrong especially with the warranty this manufacturer offers. We all are facing some realities with gas prices escalating and while the given mileage specs aren't overly impressive most people are getting better than posted mileage. The interior is very nice a pleasent surprise This is the first time I have considered a compact car and I will be ok with this. I didn't feel silly in it and the Suzuki moniker adds intrigue
suzuki,reno,2008,rye, 05/31/2008,Practical with a small kick,4,I drive 90 miles a day and I get from 420 miles to 380 miles on a full tank of gas so the mileage is alright. Needs cruise but hey it's a good price on a car that get me to were I gotta go 
suzuki,reno,2008,rc, 09/03/2009,fun small car,4,"We bought this car with a sonata in mind but the price point was to much to pass up.  Its peppy and quick for such a small engine. Plan to put on wheels, Cruise, tint and keyless with an alarm.  Love it get lots of second looks in the parking lots.  Put on a coat of turtle wax ice and it looks great. Only problem was pass seat airbag light but was resolved in one visit. 12k out the door cash and we are really happy with it! Lots of room for a small car and with some things like new wheels and tires maybe springs it will handle even better. Also try a k&n airfilter it will bump up the hp and gas mileage! Had a Suzuki motorcycle and this lives up to the name!"
suzuki,reno,2008,Tony, 02/04/2010,Great Buy,3,"I bought this '08 Reno with 2,400 miles on it. It's my ride from home to work and back. This is the first small car that I have ever owned. I traded in my '98 Lumina (168k miles)and $5400 cash and drove it off the lot. So many of the reviews have been less than complimentary, but as an owner, I think this is a great little car. 3 year/36k mile bumper to bumper, a 100k powertrain warranty, and 24 hour roadside assistance. I don't like the fact there aren't many dealerships around for service concerns, but I have only had one issue with the airbag light staying on all the time. Remember that you get what you pay for. I bought a 4-cylinder automatic. I don't expect to keep up with a Vette!"

suzuki,reno,2008,Keair, 04/09/2010,My '08 Reno,4,"I just bought my '08 Reno a few days ago, and so far I'm very impressed with its performance and ride quality. MPG aren't too bad, but they could be a little better. For about 20-25 dollars you could expect to ride for a pretty good bit on a full tank. That's pretty good compared to a much bigger vehicle. My roommate has a minivan, and that take anywhere from thirty to forty dollars to fill up, and gas doesn't last half as long as it does in mine. I'm 24, and this is my very first vehicle, and so far I'm very happy, and well satisfied with my purchase."
suzuki,swift,2000,urinvestigator, 12/12/2010,Great car to have,4,"I bought this 2000 model Chevy Metro / Suzuki Swift with 1.3 L-4 Engine and 5 speed trans. It has been great for the past 10 years. I took it any where and it just keeps running without giving me any problem. Every week it costs me less than $30 gas (even with today's gas price). I only changed her tire, and brakes. That's all I have to do besides change oil every 3000 miles. I have put 158,0000 miles on and that car still gives me 43 MPG on highway and 36 MPG in city. I just love this car."
suzuki,swift,2000,Moe's Mom, 06/02/2006,Unexpectedly Pleased,4,"We bought this little car as a commuter for our teenager who had just gotten his first job. It was low cost, got good gas mileage, and had a primered front fender. He's driven it for 3 years. We've put new tires on it, had the brakes done, and bought a new battery for it. That's all. It's been very reliable. Just for the record, the Metro and Swift are the same car. Chevy just put their name badge on the Metro after Suzuki built them. I'd recommend either model for someone on a budget needing a 35 mpg commuter."
suzuki,swift,2000,Paul B., 03/31/2009,2000 Swift AVG MPG 38,3,"I bought the car in 2007 when gas prices started going crazy to get out of my 16 mpg pickup. What a great improvement, 38 mpg plus when I don't have to haul anything large. I'm on the road alot, 18,695 last year with only one trip out of state and my annual maintenance costs below $200. Yes I perform my own maintenance and on this car it's a breeze. The car is easy to drive and maneuvers very well in today's tight parking lots. It gets up and goes for the little 1.3L, no problem accelerating on those freeway on ramps. I would recommend this car to anyone trying to save money on commuting and around town costs. Only one problem, everyone thinks they have to pass you because it a small car..."
suzuki,swift,2000,Stephen Hendricks, 05/07/2004,"Suzuki Swift, not so Swift a deal",1,"From the beginning there were problems 
with the Air Conditioning holding a 
charge.  Last year with 27K miles the 
entire back seem of 
the muffler seperated.  The printed 
warranty clearly covers the exhaust 
system.  Yet Suzuki in Timonium 
Maryland wouldn't cover it and 
quoted a price of $1165.00 to replace 
it. 

Service is terrible.  No Suzuki dealer 
EVER stocks parts.  The mirror fell off 
last month (driver side).  The Dealer 
won't schedule a repair and won't order

You can find these little cars for 1,500 to 2,500. They are excellent and cheap little cars. Don't let the low book value fool you.. you can't buy these cheap. They are good cars and people know it.

Snow tires/cruise control/remote starter/new speakers are all great upgrades.  All replacement parts are cheap for these puppies.  Be prepared for the ""Suzuki Squeal"" i.e. the fan belt squeals loudly since the design has no tensioner. I'm currently trying to ghetto rig a fix for this.

I just wanted a commuter car with great mileage yet had alittle style. True, most Swifts are driven by senior citizens because of their ease to drive, mine came with a 5 spd and just air conditioning. I figured, it had everything I needed but nothing that I didn't need.  Immediately, I used nothing but synthetic oil and put in Bosch platinum 4 plugs. At just 1895 lbs, my Swift is peppy!. Changing brakes and the air filter is a snap!. I consistently get 37mpg on mostly city traffic!. Yet, understand that the interior is generic and the brakes are soft at best. At 50000 miles the interior light and lower fan speeds failed. Still, I Love it."

What other AWD vehicle gets better than 24/30 mpg?  145 hp does not make this a sports car, but you can safely merge into traffic and keep up. In bad weather, you can pass almost everyone on the road. The list of features on the Sport model is impressive. At less than $17,000, I will not nitpick. I also own a 2006 Aerio SX Premium."

I feel great about buying this car and everyone I've showed it to (and let sit in it and explore) makes the ""Hmmm... maybe I need one of these"" face. I can see about four more being on the road by the new year. The cost is fantastic for the 'amount of car' you get. I'm especially happy with the AWD on this car. I've not had to use it yet, but I feel confident it'll add to the many safety features. "
suzuki,sx4,2007,docellis, 02/14/2010,Very Happy,5,"After driving a 2000 Suzuki, Baleno, 4x4 Wagon in Russia for 7 years without any problems, we decided to give Suzuki our business again when we moved to the USA.  The one which caught our eye was the SX4.  We purchased the last 2007 on the lot.  Immediately we were getting very good gas mileage with highs as much as 38 mpg.  Around town usually we get 29.7 on the average.  We take very long trips with our work and always end up rested and with gas money still in our pockets.  In snow we have not lost traction even one time.  The 2WD, AWD and Four Wheel Drive options are great.  We have 56,000 already without a hitch.  I would buy again and recommend this car to any one.  "
suzuki,sx4,2007,recent buyer, 12/24/2006,Great Value!,5,"We looked at Matrix, Yaris, Fit, and Versa and then saw ads for the SX4 with AWD.  The value for the price is unbelievable!  Even the base model has power locks/windows and ABS and for a fairly small price difference, the Sport model also has traction control, automatic climate control, cruise, and a 6 CD changer with more speakers.  The keyless entry and start feature seems very high-end to have on such an economical car.  We had not planned to purchase until spring, but when one was delivered exactly like we wanted we didnt dare wait.  I think this car will be discovered by a lot of buyers very soon and will become extremely scarce and in demand.  It is such a good buy and such fun to drive!"
suzuki,sx4,2007,mike, 09/09/2006,First Review of SX4,4,"I've owned this car for a little over a week.  It drives very well.  The gas mileage is not as good as, say, the Toyota Yaris, but it's still better than a minivan.  It doesn't accelerate as well as I would hope, for having one of the biggest engines of the cars I looked at, but that could improve as the engine breaks in.  I feel a lot better knowing that I am driving a safer car, and the SX4 is completely Japanese-made.  Overall, I'm happy with the 2007 Suzuki SX4, and if I find any big problems I'll tell you."

After 130k I had to have the catalytic converter changed ($1500 at Suzuki, but I got it done for $600 at Meineke), but that's the only part failure other than standard maint. items like brakes, tires and batteries.  Great cargo capacity and hard to match without going to a mid-size SUV.  Comfortable and quiet to drive.  Currently running Pirelli Cinturato P7 All Season Plus tires on it and they're awesome and quiet.  I also put a hitch on it and use it to pull a 4' x 8' utility trailer, so that's like having a pickup on hand when I need it.  "
suzuki,sx4,2007,Packs a punch, 12/29/2006,Packs a Punch,5,"We recently traded our larger SUV for the new SX4, I was a little hesitant at first because of the smaller size but the car has turned out to be an excellent buy. I love the fact that this car has AWD and is so well priced. It is not too small compared to other cars in its class and drives very smoothly. The seats are quite comfortable and rear is not as tight as I thought it would be.  I really love the added features such as the good estimated gas mileage and the outside temp gauges the car has. The pickup was also a pleasant surprise. This car is definitely a much better buy than others in its class, the Yaris is cute but way small. Also, I love the European look it has.  I am very pleased with this purchase. "
suzuki,sx4,2007,Graham, 01/13/2007,SX4 Suzuki - the People's Car!,5,"Recently, I purchased a SuzukiSX4, for my girlfriend.  Her trip to work consists of driving on a highway on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, notorious for hazardous weather conditions. Both she and I are avid car buff's, when we went looking for a vehicle that has four doors and AWD capabilities we were looking at ridiculously over priced cars in this group. The Suzuki SX4's performance, looks, and overall features are possibly the best deal out there, I'm well versed on the performance and handling of vehicles, I drive a Subaru STi, and 4x4 1-Ton Dodge cummins.  Currently, my thoughts are leaning towards having two SX4's in the family, they are so much fun.       "

We had all but decided to buy a Subaru - however we found out about the Suzuki SX4 and compared it very closely with the Impreza and found that the features were better in the SX4.  The warranty much better (100,000 miles), the financing rate was lower, and the overall base price was about $4,000 less (plus it's pretty cool looking!). So far we've put about 1,000 miles on it and have really enjoyed the car.  It drives well, has enough pep to make it up the mountain passes, is very comfortable, and has lots of interior space for a smaller car."
suzuki,sx4,2007,harmonic, 11/22/2006,Best Bang for Your Buck,5,"This vehicle has AWD for under $17,000 plus a plethora of amenities not usually found in a package for such a reasonable price. The initial quality impression is excellent. The interior fit and finish is clean, functional, and very roomy. Sitting high gives you the impression of being in a much bigger vehicle. It comes with standard power doors and locks. It has great visibility all around. Its nimble and agile suspension makes this the perfect urban road warrior. "
suzuki,sx4,2007,gardengroveguy, 11/24/2006,Brilliant Car!,4,"I bought a Suzuki Grand Vitara, but bought my wife the SX4. We loved with the unique and well designed body, the fully equipped interior, and the 4 wheel drive. All the safety equipment, all the amenities, and quality that you can see and feel. Fiat helped to design the body, so it has a true Euro look, sets it apart from the ugly ""econo-boxes"" out there. It has spirited handling and an engine that sings to you!  Its gas mileage is so-so, but we knew that before we bought. We got it in the copper color, it really stands out and gets stares! The sound system is great, the seats and comfort are great, and everything is as tight as a drum. It is built in Japan, so the assembly is laser accurate. And check the long, no deducible warranty!"
suzuki,sx4,2007,Ferris, 01/03/2007,Excellent Do-All Car,4,"This is an excellent, do-everything car. It's roomy, quiet, fun to drive (manual transmission), gets decent gas mileage (27 overall, up to 32 on the highway), has 4 wheel drive, has comfortable seats, and is just a pleasure to own.  The fit and finish are very good. The dash top is a textured hard plastic, but it works perfectly and will never peel or crack due to sun damage over the years. And yes, this quite possibly is a car that you will own for a long, long time.  The handling is sure footed, the suspension soaks up the bumps for the most part.  The seating position is comfortable and the dash layout is intuitive.  There are no silly gimmicks, it just works!"

Last week we had more than a foot of soft snow in my 1/4 mile driveway. I covered the lower grille opening to protect the radiator, locked in the AWD and plowed out. Had snow rolling over the hood up to the windshield but the SX4 kept going. Is that great or what?  Visibility is excellent for touring the countryside because of the large glass and upright seating. Stops on a dime. Parks anywhere. Climbs hills without roads. Very wind stable for a compact vehicle."
suzuki,sx4,2007,SS from CT, 01/05/2007,My Suzuki SX4,4,"I have owned this vehicle for two months and have driven in all kinds of traffic conditions.  This vehicle comes well equipped for a base model.  It has good looks, ample power, and performance, all at a great price.  The 5-speed manual transmission has much better acceleration than the automatic and this vehicle has little trouble merging into highway traffic.  It has great handling on country roads.  For a small car it has decent room and a very nice quiet ride.  This is a well built solid car. "
suzuki,sx4,2007,Tom, 11/26/2006,"Great Value, Features, Fun and Comfort",4,"This fun to drive vehicle has a solid, sturdy feel that is equally good to drive in the city or at high speeds on the open road.  It has great forward vision, seat comfort, trustworthy brakes, quick handling, little body lean, a good ride, it's versatile, has a neat AWD set up, and we feel safe in it with all of the air bags.

suzuki,sx4,2007,pens87, 12/01/2006,Great Buy,4,"I got mine a week ago and I love it.  It is the first Suzuki that I've owned.  I wasn't sure about the Suzuki brand, but it's great.  It cost a total of $16,500 after tax, and what a great deal for that price.  You get AWD, a nice interior, decent horsepower, and all of the safety features.  In my opinion this is the best buy if you're looking for a car under $20,000.  I looked at a few cars that were priced at $19,000 - $21,000 and this SX4 is as good if not better than them.  I think for $16,000 this car is a steal.  It looks great on the outside and inside.  It has great headroom/legroom and a lot of trunk space.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the speaker/audio quality.  What a great buy."
suzuki,sx4,2007,rp, 12/08/2008,Good AWD value,3,"Nice little car, particularly in snow. Lots of leg and head room for the size. 30 mpg hwy, decent for AWD. Good fit and finish - very tight for an eco car. After 8 months, water leaking from A/C on to the passenger floor/carpeting diagnosed as ""cracked cowl"" per the dealer; fixed in a day. Revs at nearly 4000RPM in 5th gear at hwy cruising speeds; geared way too high - needs o/d or 6th gear; would help hwy fuel econ and keep the noise down.  Seats lack back support- no lumbar option even on high end model. 10 gallon tank is too small; commuting 25K/yr, feels like I'm always stopping for gas. Hopefully long term reliability will be decent like earlier Suzuki's."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Lorenzo Menendez, 06/03/2009,"Adding power, better gas mil., c-control",5,"Wrotte a review on 11-13-2006, since then I improved the little monster, added a TURBONATOR (cheap in cost) and H&K air filter, they increased the horsepower and the little monster flies the speedometer needle moves like the ones in the race car. The mpg changed from 30 to 37 mpg on a flat hwy, using cruise control that I had put in after writing my review in 2006.  One thing to remember, keep the tires properly inflated. Had the SX4 since 2006 without any mechanical problems, runs like a true champ.  Have gone thru some major storms and floods in AWD without any problems."
suzuki,sx4,2007,cathie1, 10/07/2006,Great Car for the Money,5,"It is a great car.  It is extremely comfortable. When you are driving it, you feel like you are driving a SUV. The car does not have great initial pep, but once you get moving it takes off.  It has a very smooth ride even on rough roads. Everyone I have taken in it likes it also. Even the people who sat in the back seat which is also very comfortable. It is more comfortable then the Honda CR-V, which my brother owns. I only paid $14,900 for it. It is not a $17,000 + vehicle like someone else said (unless you get a lot of upgrades) and on an empty take it cost $19 to fill up at a cost of $2.23 per gallon. It even comes with a great warranty (7y, 100K bumper to bumper) which gives you confidence."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Richard, NC,Dick's SX4,4,The SX4 is a good looking vehicle.  Folks are always asking what it is.  It's great fun to drive.

suzuki,sx4,2007,Skwerl, 12/15/2006,Fun and Functional!,4,"I had a 2000 RAV4 which was totaled in an accident.  I loved that truck and went to look at the new RAV4.  I was very disappointed by the new design.  It is way too big for my needs.  So, I looked at all the usual suspects and was about to buy a Hyundai Tucson when I stumbled upon the SX4.  I liked it immediately and have no regrets about purchasing one.  Some of the reviews, Edmunds included, are critical of the SX4's performance. They're off base. It's quick enough for the average driver.  The only real issue with the SX4 is the gas mileage. If that concerns you, look elsewhere, but if you want a fun and functional AWD crossover, this is it."
suzuki,sx4,2007,samsx4, 12/24/2006,Great Vehicle,5,I just bought my SX4 and am very happy with it. I went looking to purchase an affordable vehicle for my daily commute and once I drove the SX4 I was sold. I did a lot of research via the internet on affordable vehicles and had narrowed my planned purchase to a couple of models.  The SX4 was not one of them because I didn't know it existed. I live in a mountainous area and am very pleased at the power and handling of the vehicle. I test drove a number of other vehicles and didn't find any others that came close that also offered AWD at this affordable of a price.

It comes in handy. Knock on wood, I have not had any problems with it. It now has over 25,000 miles and it is still running great! You really feel like you are driving an SUV. There is alot of head room. I would recommend this car to anyone! It's a great buy!"

It was a well thought out, well engineered product. I've even heard that this can tow 2k lbs and they make body hitches for it.....actually listed as 2400 lbs in some sites. Has anyone tried it yet...? Maybe for short trips."

People are still asking about the vehicle and its performance. Recommend it to anyone that wants to buy a small reliable and cheap cross over station wagon type. If you want it to have more power and burn front tires get a tornado."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Holly, 05/04/2008,Great car!,5,"This is a great car. I have owned this car for 21 months and I am very happy.  It is not great on the hills, but is a good car overall.  Almost no mantinence(which is great).  My car averages 24.4 miles per gallon.  Very roomy for people of all sizes.  The car is very easy to get in and out of.  It is good to have the AWD when the weather is bad.  I am very pleased."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Nikki, 09/02/2006,Solid Designed Suzuki SX4,5,"I just took delivery of my new SX4 yesterday. I could not believe a vehicle with this level of design, features, and build quality could be had for $15,999.  The test drive sealed the deal, as it accelerated nicely to highway speeds, while loaded with four (full-grown) adults riding along in surprizing comfort.  This vehicle has plenty of leg-room and head-room to easily accommodate passengers six feet tall in both the front and back seats.  The rear set of doors allow the back seat to be readily accessible for use with children's car seats. Not having to change the timing belt alone will save some serious maintenance costs and remove the ticking time-bomb scenario that occurs with interference engines using timing belts. "
suzuki,sx4,2007,lorenzo menendez, 11/13/2006,"Great Car, SUV, Station Wagon, Race Car",5,"The Suzuki SX4 is a real attention getter.  It is made to handle different on road and off road conditions.  The steering is great.  If you get one with the racing SX4 logo on the side doors it looks even better. The price is also great, along with a smooth and fast engine. This vehivcle meets the specs to race on the motor cross races, where the cones are used and the race is for the best time."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Greg Myers, 12/10/2009,Why you shouldn't buy an SX4,2,"I bought the SX4 for my wife as a Christmas present in 2006 . The colors was beautiful and it had a manual trans . (Her favorite ). Since then , the engine failed at 30,000 miles , the airbag module($1800)failed , it has thrown numerous check engine lights and and now has a bad catalytic converter . Guess what , if you aren't aware , your emissions warranty runs out at 80,000 miles and there's no getting around it. The trouble code is for a catalytic flow efficiency problem that is more likely an oxygen sensor fault like Nissan has just experienced . The dealer installed cost of the new cat is just over $900.00. Do it yourselfers can get it at the dealer for about $500.00."
suzuki,sx4,2007,biklover52, 01/31/2012,Watch out for Trans Problems,3,"My wife bought this car in 09. At first she liked it very much. Mileage is not great around 25 on the highway. We took a couple longs trips and that's when you notice how small it is inside. Through town or back and forthe to work is ok. Around the 70k mark the trans mission went out and we had it replaced under warranty. We at about 85k the trans went out again. So we dicided to get ride of it before anything else went wrong. Suzuki told us this was very unusual and worked with us through all of it.
We might purchase another one but not sure."

suzuki,sx4,2007,e. wood, 12/11/2008,A happymobile!,4,"The fit, finish, controls and sound system are excellent.  I was initially disappointed with town mileage (17- 19 mpg), but it was winter and the car was new. The occasional use of AWD was handy. At 2500 miles I took a trip to Florida, got 26.1 mpg.  The transmission would downshift twice climbing some of the overpasses on I- 75, to maintain the 75 mph speed limit. At 7500 miles, a trip to south dakota and colorado, got 28.2 mpg (I hung a sign, ""60 mph"" in the back window. Worked okay on the interstate). The wagon held all my gear (camping), and the (2-wheel) bike module is quite stable, although I took a folding stepstool to ease its use. After 14,000 miles it gets 20-21 around town."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Randar, 05/30/2009,better than expected,4,I bought this car used with 9200 miles on it and have been suprised with how nice a car this really is. The in town gas milage is really poor but I mostly drive on rual highways and have been getting 32 to 33.4 miles per gallon. The car has great acelleration when needed and has nice headroom. The down side is the seats are poorly designed and hurt your back when driving long distances and the oversized A pillars create a blind spot that takes some getting used to. Overall this is a nice little car thats a lot of fun to drive and I would recommend it to anyone.

Lots of room, good ride and performance and the all wheel drive is handy in bad weather.  "
suzuki,sx4,2007,Pascal, 07/15/2009,Alternator trouble,2,"My wife and i bought two SX-4 in december 2006. At first we did like the car but after a couple of month we thought that it was consuming more gas than the seller told us, but we dealt with it by slowing down our speed in order to stay beneath 9 liters/100km. We now have them for a little more than two and a half year and last week at 72K km, my wife's car alternator jammed and it wasn't covered by warranty anymore so we paid to changed the alternator. 10 days later, at 78K km my car's alternator jammed as well! We tought thas was abnormal so we called the dealership and he told us he couldnt do a thing. We then contacted suzuki canada and they told us the same thing. Don't buy that car!"
suzuki,sx4,2007,bill varnell, 09/07/2009,2007 sx4,4,We have owned this car since 2/2007. It is our 1st Japanese vehicle and we like it very much. It is great in the snow and quite comfortable on long trips.  We even tow our two jetskis several hundred miles on vacation without a problem. The cons are the fuel mileage and poor quality interior. I would buy this model again but would like to see several improvements.

Purchased our 2007 Suzuki SX4 immediately after arriving in States.  Best gas mileage is 38 and averages town & country 28.9.  Comfortable on long trips and we know long  trips.  Have had two years and have 52,000 miles.  Would buy another Suzuki and do recommend to anyone wanting a four wheel drive car with performance, good gas mileage, and dependability then go Suzuki SX4.  We constantly have folks coming over to talk to us about our SX4 wondering what it is and how do we like it.  Always give a good report."

The SX4 is decently bigger than it photographs; though 4in narrower and 3ft shorter, it comes surprisingly close to having the same passenger and cargo volume of the Mercury Sable that it displaced for this family of five!  The 11 gal gas tank reads ""empty"" after using just nine, accelerating up a hill from a dead stop takes patience, and iAWD with ESP is the new black."
suzuki,sx4,2007,tim tschosik, 12/02/2006,A Lot of Car for the Money,5,"The Suzuki SX4 is an excellent car. It is a great daily driver, good on gas, and has great responsiveness in the 0 to 40 range. Metro traffic here doesn't really let me get to 60 mph. It's very quiet for a small car.  AWD at this price can not be found elsewhere."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Marie, 12/13/2006,Rides Like the Wind,4,"This car is super.  It's fun and practical.  It goes from point A to B without using much gas.  The best part is, it's 4 wheel drive, which is great for snow, etc.  It looks good, drives great and I have absolutely no regrets in purchasing this car.  Who would think such a small vehicle would drive so smoothly?  I love it!  It has a small gas tank, so you have to gas up a little more often but it's worth it since it uses less than $15.00 per week for me.  My son wants me to give him the car when he turns 16 next week.  Not a chance, I'm keeping it."
suzuki,sx4,2007,SK Denver, 01/30/2007,SX4 in the Denver Blizzard!,4,"I owned a 2WD Ford Pickup for eight years in Denver.  So call me crazy. The 22"" snowfall in December finally got my attention. I was sick of getting stuck. I had done a little research on the SX4 and was curious about it. After I found one (most Suzuki dealers in Denver sell them as soon as they get them) I test drove and took it home. Since then we have had five snowstorms with ice and snowpack everywhere. The SX4 (Suzie is her name now) never showed any hesitation. An additional plus was with all the snow piled up everywhere, parking became an issue for everyone in the big SUVs, but not for me. What can I say? All the other reviews address comfort, ergonomics, and safety, but I am just enjoying how much fun it is"
suzuki,sx4,2007,Wayne S, 02/12/2007,"Blends Sportiness, Utility, Economy, and Safety",5,"I have 1,300 miles on my SX4 Sport, manual. It has been getting 23 to 25 mpg in town, no stop n go for my town. I have not taken any long trips in it, but get ~26 mpg at 75 mph. Its ride, handling, noise levels are all very good for its class. Its snow performance over the past two days was very good. The stereo system for 50 year-old ears is more than adequate. the ease of getting in and out is wonderful for this class. Its visibility is generally very good. Its storage / hauling capability should cover 95% of my needs.  I traded in a 2001 Honda Prelude for it. I gave up the sweet Honda engine performance. I gained all weather capability, easier exit, better visibility (seeing / being seen), quieter, conveniences, safety, and passenger / cargo space. Its gas mileage and handling in normal city / highway conditions seem essentially equal."
suzuki,sx4,2007,soul_ride68, 02/23/2007,Better Than ALL the rest,5,"My wife bought the Fit in October and my nephew bought the Versa two weeks later so I have plenty to compare with. Both of them regret not buying the Suzuki SX4. With the warranty and the standard features included with this vehicle, their vehicles don't even come close in comparison. They both agree that paying for the name (Nissan & Honda) isn't what a savvy buyer should do if there is a manufacturer building a better car out there for less money. I would recommend this car to anyone!"
suzuki,sx4,2007,Jaime, 07/12/2007,Suzuki SX4,4,"I agree with most of the good things that have been mentioned by previous reviewers but wanted to add one negative that I just discovered - the back seat does not accommodate well a rear-facing car seat. If rear facing, it has to be in the middle and it's hard to get it as stable. If you put it on the outside areas of the backseat, there is no room for the front seat driver or passenger to get adequate leg room or tilt their seats back. And we're NOT tall people.  Consequently, we had to move my daughter forward facing much earlier than we'd planned (at 13 months)."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Vladimir, 05/22/2007,Did I buy SX4 too,3,"I've read many good reviews. I bought the car. Now I am wondering whether it is the same car which many other reviewers described. It is slow. In the city it is OK but joining highway traffic is a dangerous exercise. Going from 45 to 60 is so slow. You push the accelerator pedal and wait and wait and wait. You need to be very careful. Gas mileage is 23 mpg. Ride is not smooth and solid. The car behaves like a heavy and unwieldy carriage on the road. Missing many small storage places. To a future buyer, please, TEST drive."
suzuki,sx4,2007,alice, 07/01/2007,I'm lovin' it,4,"No regrets - it's a pleasure and a pal. I drive 22 miles each way to work, along very twisting, hilly roads in the northeast. Haven't tried it in deep sub-zero conditions yet, but ice, rain, snow, fog, heat, etc., have all been here, and we've done that with no problems at all."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Wayne S, 07/01/2007,"Blends Sport, Utility, Economy, Safety",5,"Follow up to earlier review of 2/11. Now have little over 5,000 miles on SX4. Gas mileage 95% in town, no stop and go has been 25-28. 28 requires low rpm shifts and some coasting techniques. Solid build, no rattles. A/C works well for 90+ heat. No mechanical issues. Has done very well SOFT offroading up sloped grassy hillsides around baseball parking area. If teen takes off to school with this car I will very likely replace it with another SX4, but I might look at sedan to be released. I do not often require more storage than basic trunk would provide."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Mark J., 08/07/2007,Very happy,4,Bought an AWD/AT version and love it so far. Very fun to drive despite the relatively sluggish performance. The outward visibility takes some getting used to but in general it is as good as it gets in a car of this configuration. I've discovered one odd thing about this car that prospective buyers should know: the owner's manual says that the AWD/AT version cannot be towed with either the front or rear wheels on the pavement due to potential damage of the drivetrain. I haven't asked my dealer about this yet but I can't believe that any car maker would design a car that requires a flatbed tow truck. The standard transmission and FWD versions do not carry this warning.
suzuki,sx4,2007,belowme, 10/06/2007,SX4 Sport / auto,4,"Great little car. Fun to drive, handles great just missing a turbo version. Comfortable and roomy. Gas mileage isnt bad for an AWD car but gas tank could be a bit bigger. With the amount of standard fatures of the Sport version with auto you cant beat it. Nicley designed cabin, not flimsy and cheap looking. "
suzuki,sx4,2007,Renee, 10/26/2007,Lovin' my Suzuki,4,"I commute to work everyday and this car makes for a great ride.  The trip is not at all highway and the gas mileage is not horrible, but not what I expected. The features that came with the sport model were one of the selling points. You usually pay a lot more for these options. The looks are deceiving from the outside. Plenty of room, even for larger people. This car is very sporty looking also. The price is great for an AWD."
suzuki,sx4,2007,SX4Sport, 12/08/2007,All in one car,5,"My 5M Sport averages at least 29 mpg. Try to find another AWD car that can match that.  And the AWD is for real.  I have blazed trails through 6+ inches of snow before the plows have come through.  I have pushed the limits in empty snow covered parking lots and I was incredibly impressed.  The ground clearance isn't high enough for any serious off-roading, but the AWD grips like claws on the road."
suzuki,sx4,2007,fap, 06/12/2009,Maintenance costs,4,"My wife and I were looking for a small car with reasonable mileage and comfortable seats.  Mileage is constant 27mpg with commuter driving 110 milies per day.  Ride great for small car and the seats are better than some larger cars.  My wife at 5'5"" has hard time with view at front left due to bad blind spot.  Here's the rub, needed first break job with rotors(no warning) at 42k (not bad). Could not get dealer appt. and had metal on metal so we had our local garage do the job.  None of the parts are available after market and the front pads alone cost $200. With rotors the front brakes were more than $400.00.  AWD maintenance is also greatly out of line with other makes.  "
suzuki,sx4,2007,thrylos, 09/20/2006,Suzuki SX4,5,"The Suzuki SX4 is a great 4WD vehicle.  I traded in a Focus ZX3 for it.  It feels much tighter than the Focus did.  It has nice construction and ergonomics, and a nice airy cabin.  It has responsive steering and good handling.  It also has amazing options for the price.  The seats are comfotable and the styling is great.  It looks like a stretched Mini Cooper.  Suzuki hit a home run with this car.  There is no competition in this segment and at this price point, especially after taking the 7/100 warranty, the standard features, and the four wheel drive into account.  Ths SX4 is a really nice tight daily commuter car that can manage tough weather easily."
suzuki,sx4,2007,britton.peddie, 11/17/2010,This car seems nice - buy another,1,"Suzuki of America is out of money and time, When I took my vehicle in for a warranty related repair, the dealer, who DOES NOT SELL SUZUKIS - told me they required a $1000.00 dollar deposit before they WOULD EVEN LOOK at the repair.
This car is crap and they should go away [violative content deleted] where apparently they do OK selling crap product to uninformed individuals."
suzuki,sx4,2007,trixiechartwel, 04/21/2007,Sporty SX4 JLX,4,"I bought an SX4 JLX 5-speed at the beginning of April. I just love it!  It performs well, it is comfy, the 6 CD stereo with the audio controls in the steering wheel is awesome. The price was right for front wheel drive, all wheel drive and 4x4. Would recommend this little vehicle to anyone who wants a fun, safe drive!"
suzuki,sx4,2007,flyright, 06/08/2008,Good Car/ Good Value,4,"My family has owned Suzuki's in the past and have been very happy. Without hesitation I purchased the '07 SX4. The dealer advertised it as 35 mpg, but I get 28.7 mpg so that was a bit of a disappointment. I have approx 25,000 miles on it now. So far I have had to replace the oxygen sensor,the A/C was kind of blah so took it back in and now they have to replace some clutch in the A/C.  Other than that, I love the car. It has more room than most compact cars. It handles sweet when you need to leave someone in the dust. The acceleration is the best. Turning is fab. Braking, stops on a dime. The interior has a sportscar look, pretty cool. Quiet enginne but strong.  Has some get up and go.  "
suzuki,sx4,2007,DEALERS DAUGHTER, 09/28/2008,She's a looker,4,"As a auto dealers daughter, I found my Suzuki SX4 crossover on Edmunds.com-- what attracted my curiosity was the AWD option in a smaller size car. Very happy with my vehicle. It's built solidly and gives a safe handling ride--really look forward to another winter when my little baby purrs and passes all those big, expensive cars. I added a narrow side accent moulding to the car and I must say it is definitelly a show stopper. Gas mileage could be a bit better but it's decent for an AWD and I would really like to chop off the top and have a sunroof. You won't be dissapointed in this car and will love to drive it and strut your stuff!"
suzuki,sx4,2007,john starkey, 02/08/2008,a real winner,4,Great little car agile and tough lots of fun to drive. Great in the snow. A real winner.
suzuki,sx4,2007,somebody, 02/22/2007,Great Looking / Driving AWD Vehicle,5,"This vehicle has the power, looks, and performance under one roof for less then $18,000 (fully loaded). it feels great to drive it. It has a very good design. It is the least expensive AWD vehicle on the market. This car will be extremely popular in 2007."
suzuki,sx4,2007,raderator, 02/27/2007,"My Brother Thought It Cost $23,000",4,"But I paid only $15,599 after some haggling.  The handling, ride, and comfort all are top notch.  I took it to a local snowed-in park and did mange to finally get stuck, but then I learned to stay in L and keep a foot on the brake to prevent wheel spin. The traction control on the Sport is probably worth the extra $1,000.  I love the MP3/WMA CD player, intermittent rear wiper, keyless entry, daytime running lights, and LOW insurance.  The automatic transmission shifts very smoothly and runs at only 3,000 rmp at 80 mph, which is 1,000 rmp less than the manual.  I'm still on my first tank of gas so I don't know the millage yet.  The tumble-forward rear seat creates a large, square cargo area, that is great for dogs. But I'll probably remove it."
suzuki,sx4,2007,suziiiqqq, 02/28/2007,Love It,4,I live in the mountains and commute over them.  My little SX4 is great in the snow! I call it my mountain goat!
suzuki,sx4,2007,The Pegster, 03/13/2007,What a Hoot!,4,"I was not looking for this car when I found it.  This little car just had everything!  The AWD is what sold it for me.  We have a very steep driveway in New England, so either a 4WD or AWD is a must.  It worked great this winter.  I do a lot of city driving, and it's great fun zipping around town.  I can't wait until they come out with a convertible!"
suzuki,sx4,2007,Andy, 03/17/2007,Good AWD Vehicle for the Price,4,"I bought this vehicle two months ago.  The main selling points were the AWD and lots of standard features for under $15,000.  It is fun to drive, very maneuverable, and one of the easiest vehicles to park.  I loaded it with five passengers and it did just fine."
suzuki,sx4,2007,james wellington, 03/23/2007,The best in the market!,5,This vehicle has all-wheel drive and is cheap in price but not quality. With all the standard features you can not beat this vehicle!

suzuki,sx4,2007,MD, 03/26/2007,Great car,4,"Bought a SX4 JX last fall. No problems at all with it. It's built like a tank, and I enjoy driving it very much. There are some small things and it could use a touch more power and better fuel economy, but no car is perfect. For the price, this has to be one of the best values out there. And it's unique. Looks better than those other economy cars out there in my opinion. "
suzuki,sx4,2007,mcidriver, 03/29/2007,Super Little Car,4,Very nice little car. Love the AWD with ESP. Pay the extra for the top of the line model. You won't be disappointed. 
suzuki,sx4,2007,MySX4, 04/14/2007,Love my SX4,5,"Owned my SX4 2 months now and absolutely love it!  Came loaded w/all options: heated side mirrors, cruise, 6 CD changer, etc.  It's the little ""big"" car that's a blast to drive.  It's small on the outside, but very roomy inside.  Love all the headroom!  It sits up a bit higher making you feel like you're driving a bigger car.  Taken it skiing and with AWD it had no problem in the snow.  Gets great gas mileage.  Bought it mainly for commuting, but love driving it so much I take it everywhere.  Small-looking storage space in the back fools you; I've loaded it down with tons of groceries w/room to spare (w/o folding seats forward).  Our skis and gear fit with the seats folded down."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Dubba D, 05/08/2007,SX4 Magic!,5,"If you are looking for an AWD that is the BEST bang for the buck, you can't beat the SX4. Where else can you get a car with all these options for this price? Can't do it. Suzuki finally hit a homerun here. When the secret is finally out of the bag, watch the supply and demand! Everywhere I go, people ask questions about this car. When I bought the car, I was like a lot of others who would question buying a Suzuki. Well, I don't have any more questions!"
suzuki,sx4,2007,Cindie, 04/04/2007,My Little Buggy,4,"So far, so good.  The gas tank could be larger. I feel really safe in this car, and it is well built and has many amenities for the price.  I won't fear snow this winter, and the car is so easy to park. I like sitting up high, and the visibility is so much better.  I have a hip problem, and the seats are very comfortable, so I'm not in pain.  I've never owned anything other than GM cars, so this is a totally new experience for me.  A great car for a 50-something single woman."
suzuki,sx4,2007,jbrew, 04/26/2007,"Bargain, bargain, bargain",4,"This car is an absolute bargain.  There isn't a car out there that comes to the SX4 package, including AWD.  I bought this car because I live in the mountains and wanted an economical vehicle that could handle the snow.  Drove through the snow the other night with no problems.  Not only do you have the AWD, but also the Electronic Stability control which is included in the sport model.  "
suzuki,sx4,2007,MySX4, 05/18/2007,Love My SX4 Sport!,5, I drive my SX4 about 30 miles to and from work. I haven't had any problems.

It's not a go-fast car but it is fun to drive and has a lot of safety features which your insurance company loves to hear about. "
suzuki,sx4,2007,Tom, 07/16/2007,"SX4 sport, great car at great price",4,"Use it for driving to office, half highway half local. Got 28mpg (with 2wd). Feel a little noiser when speed up before get to 50 miles. SX4 is for people would like to have a small car but also have trunk space, and can have 4wd on a snow day. Small car? It actually is not small at all. 6' man sits in from seat very comfortably. It weighs a bit heavy but very stable when driving."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Dave Nicandri, 08/05/2007,"So far, so good",5,"I've had my ""Sedici"" for one week and so far, so good.  I got 30.3 mpg on the first tank of gas, which included mostly freeway but a substantial amount of around town driving.  I love the outward visibility and the leg and head room in the front seats.  Rear leg room is adequate.  This car is a lot of fun to drive and I think I'm going to like it a lot, over time.  The first big test will be after my first road trip with all the tailgate gear.  I have the while colored model, which looks very crisp, to my eye. I've gotten used to the keyless entry with ease and I like being able to paddle shift between 3rd and 4th gears. As a long-term FIAT owner, having this car is like a reunion."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Bungalow Bill, 07/02/2007,SX4 is a winner,4,"I've only had my basic SX4 manual 5 speed for two weeks but my initial evaluation is in - this vehicle is a winner. True it could get a few extra miles per gallon and a little extra highway power would be welcome but overall this AWD is a real find. Great looks, a well thought out interior and lots of space for a subcompact make the selection easy. The price is a real bonus. This vehicle needs to be compared to other lower priced 4WD and AWD vehicles not just the two wheel drive subcompacts. The key here is AWD. I do wish the standard model came with cruise control. I'm looking forward to winter and its snow!"
suzuki,sx4,2007,Bob, 09/13/2007,Nice price for AWD,4,Wanted AWD for winter driving.  Handles well for small vehicle.  Good features included in base model w/con. group.  Have 7 yr. all inclusive warranty and received a good price for trade in.  No problems so far.
suzuki,sx4,2007,Jerry, 03/03/2008,Cool Car!,5,"I love it, especially size of this car. It is easy to drive and excel in all season weather, rain, ice, snow. I used AWD 4 wheel drive. It amazes me."
suzuki,sx4,2007,MeinA2, 06/09/2007,Suzuki Newbie,4,"Just picked up a 2007 SX4 Sport in May of this year.  Saw it first at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January, and from that moment I sat in it I knew I had to have this car.  The styling is quirky without being too outlandish.  The interior craftmanship and ergonomics are great for such a low priced vehicle. I live in Michigan and won't fear this year's winter driving with the AWD that I now have available to me.  I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a stylish and well equipped alternative to the sudden deluge of subcompacts now being sold."
suzuki,sx4,2007,60 year old man, 06/28/2007,I Like Mine,4,"I got a copper colored one.   I really like mine so far.  I think it looks good.  The price is great for what you get.  I love driving mine.  I went from a full size SUV to a midsize SUV to this. I like this the best of the three.  It is not a $30,000 vehicle so don't expect it to be.  It handles nicely, sits comfortably, gets decent gas mileage.  I like the warranty (as long as dealer stays around).  I am over 6 feet tall and large framed and I feel comfortable driving it.  Has plenty of headroom and legroom.  View from driver's seat appears much larger than it is.  Appears to be well built.  My daughter had an early model Suzuki and drove it HARD.  It just kept going and going."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Richard55, 08/10/2007,Like it way more than I thought I would.,5,"I was looking for a long warranty AND the most affordable new 4WD I could find. I got lucky that the SX4 was also a solid and enjoyable ride. Some reviewers criticize the heavier weight than the Fit or Versa. The up side on this is that we don't get blown around in wind or around large trucks at speed. Solid footprint, which for safety's sake, I'll take anytime. The car seems tight (I've been a BMW/Audi/VW addict for 20 years), the seating position is top shelf, and the minimalist styling is esthetically on mark. I do have some gripes, but I'll nail those down later. I went for the Sport, which options it up, then added XM, iPod, armrest and the factory winter mats, ending up at almost $18k."
suzuki,sx4,2007,eddiethefish, 09/03/2007,Nice little car,4,"Getting 26 mpg in town, 32 mpg on freeway.  Has plenty of power once you get momentum up, but is kind of gutless starting from stoplight up a hill.  Nice tight feel to steering wheel.  Has short turning radius.  Plenty of room for a large size driver.  Fun to drive in town.  Nice commuter car, but would not like to drive it cross country."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Ned, 10/03/2007,European look/Japanese quality,4,"Good looking, fun to drive, good fuel economy and problem free car."
suzuki,sx4,2007,Cindy, 10/20/2007,Suzuki Warranty Issues,4,My SX4 has an AC problem and I have standing water in the passenger side of the car. This isn't enough to affect my opinion of the SX4. In general I have been very happy and enjoy driving the car. I am however very disappointed in Suzuki. Since purchasing my vehicle the dealership in my area has closed. My only option is to drive 60 miles for service. This in itself would be acceptable BUT Suzuki will not assist in assuring I have a vehicle to drive while my car is being serviced and the dealership isn't going to use the courtisy shuttle to drive me 60 miles to my home so I am basically left stranded and praying the vehicle issue can be resolved in one day. 
suzuki,sx4,2007,CHIP, 04/03/2008,Love it!,4,10 months of driving and still loving this little car. Fuel tank could be bigger but makes me feel better with the cheap fill ups. Traded in a PT Cruiser Limited which was very unreliable and haven't regretted it yet. Great car for the money!

suzuki,sx4,2008,James Hamilton, 10/02/2015,My Wife Wanted a Reliable AWD Car,5,"My wife loves the car and she routinely receives compliments from others regarding the styling.  From my point of view (husband) the car has been ideal for her as she loves to bird watch and takes the car off highway quite routinely.  Also we have had zero problems with the vehicle.  This is the second Suzuki we have owned; the first was the Suzuki XL7 but as our kids grew up and moved out we downsized.  We recently took the SX4 from Mapleton Utah to Seattle and the ride was comfortable and without incident traveling 75 to 80MPH averaging 28MPG.

suzuki,sx4,2008,Marilyn Miller, 07/29/2018,Great Choice!,5,"I purchased the SX4 Hatchback in 2008 and was looking for a sporty little hatchback that was also good in the snow and reliable.  I've owned Honda's, Toyota's and Nissan's over the years, and each had good and bad points.  Was curious about the Suzuki - it's funny looking and different, which always appeals to me, and was one of the rare cars that has AWD and a manual transmission.  Plus it came with auto climate control, keyless electronic entry, rear window and mirror defrost, auto wipers, cruise control, tire pressure sensors, adjustable tilt steering wheel and surround sound stereo system for under $18k with the top package.  I've owned it for 10 years, and it has been the best car with the lowest maintenance costs I've ever owned.  Only one dealer recall issue with a sensor in the passenger seat for the air bag sensing which was replaced without issue.  Other than that, I've had the tires replaces, had to replace and upgrade the stereo, and regular oil changes and other regular maintenance. One big benefit is that this car has a timing chain, not a timing belt, so you don't have to have it replaced!

suzuki,sx4,2008,diddiegirl, 10/12/2011,"over 100,000 and not a problem!",4,"I purchased this little car in June on 2008.
I drive from Maine to Boston to work over 160 miles at a time.
Thankfully I have never had a single problem with the car and I am on only my second set of tires with lots of tread to go.
I have put on one set of brake pads and done a lot of oil changes, but that is all.
Gas mileage is about 27mpg, but I must say I do not always follow the speed limits!
I just read with a different air filter it may increase my mpg, so I'm going to give it a try.
Great in the snow and reliable, low maintainance, and room enough for most everything but a sheet of plywood!! :)
No complaints here! (ok one, I wish the gas tank were bigger!)"
suzuki,sx4,2008,MrClean, 04/08/2010,Best car I've ever owned out of 23 cars!,4,"First brand new car I have ever bought. The few problems I have had have all been covered under warranty. (New fuel pump, spoiler coming off, and a leaking strut. Other then that the car has performed flawlessly! With the drive by wire you have to reset the throttle a few times to get it just right for it to program itself to the way drive. I currently have 18,000 miles on it and have almost 50% of the tread left on the factory tires. I have them rotated every 5k miles & they work & sound almost the same as the day I purchased the car. I average 27 mpg on mountain freeway driving at an average 75 mph, at 55 mph on the same 187 mile route I got 35 mpg. It performs awesome in the snow!"

The car is a beast in the snow... I work in healthcare and we don't get snow day. I've been tempted lately to trade the car in but really don't have a good reason...

It will reach 80k miles this month, and the only things I've done are replaced the tires and front brake pads, plus the regular 30k services and oil changes. Love the keyless ignition and entry, love the fuel range module (I get an average of 27mpg, up to 40 on road trips), love how I sit in it and that the windshield doesn't feel like it's too close to my forehead. :) The only issue I have is the suspension--feels like it needs stabilization when I hit bumps on corners. It rides nice, however, and feels very safe in all other conditions. Never had any problems on snow or ice. :)"
suzuki,sx4,2008,Rushikesh Aage, 09/28/2017,Cars a Jackpot for a low price!,5,"Extremely reliable car. I am a student and I have had the car for two years now. Mileage count at this point is 129K. I commute for about 100 miles a day for college and work and never had any problems with the car.  The engine and transmission run great. The car is economical in terms of gas mileage, gives me around 25 city and 31 highway. If you can maintain the car well (by the way it does not require much maintenance except for oil changes and tire rotations) it will run forever. PROS: Reliability, Gas Mileage, Performance, Handling, Roomy Interiors. CONS: None that I can think of for a 2008 budget car but having a arm rest, Bluetooth or a AUX port would have been a plus for me.

The only time it left me stranding is with a dead battery. I have only have to do routine repairs. The only exception new front struts at $500 at 105,000. The car now has 109,000 and everything still works. Air still blows cold. My only complaint is now parts are somewhat hard to find and fuel economy is a little low for a car of it's size. I average 25 but do very little highway driving.

suzuki,sx4,2008,mistyridgeman, 09/14/2012,"Tough, economical car back roads and city traffic",4,"The 2.0 liter engine with manual 5-speed is snappy and responsive. Drop it into 4th on the highway and you have plenty of passing power. On back roads, it clings to gravel and dirt, and it handles great in snow (assuming you actually know how to drive in snow). This car has walked through mud, snow, tall weeds, and easily navigates city streets (drove it through downtown Chicago with ease). The newer six-speeds lack the snap and downshifting is finicky, so I'll be keeping my 5-speed rather than trading up. Best car in its class, especially for the money."

The car rides, drives, feels and performs better and more comfortably than the other compacts I test drove. Over the course of 6 mos, I drove a Civic twice, Corolla, Hyundai Elantra, Nissan Sentra and Kia, still the clear choice was the sx4, it feels so much safer, solid and substantial."
suzuki,sx4,2008,Scott, 10/06/2015,Cuter then a bugs ear!,5,"Second review. Still Love it, love it, love it. Recently replaced rear cat due to pipe rotting but did it myself to bring down cost. Car now has 70k miles.
This car is basic as could be but that's fine with me, can't think of any complaints, I knew I wanted a basic simple no excitement car. It drives great, handles wonderful, does everything I ask it to do with no problems. My wife loves that it sits higher, more comfortable then her expensive Mazda.
Another update 10/9/18
Still have car, still very reliable no major problems.  Tire light comes on and off and brake light just started to blink on and off. Not low on fluid  maybe bad part. Either way no complaints.  Just replaced all fluids and ready for winter
Update 4/21
Car doing great, brakes still are garbage.  Had to buy new pads a rotors again. Last time I bought expensive ones but still don't last.  I read sx4 alway had brake issues. 
Besides that sill love car. Just installed trailer hitch on car. Glad I bought car its been very good to me.

suzuki,sx4,2008,Lani S Gomer, 06/13/2016,Love My Cute Lil Car,5,"I bought her brand new and now she has 58,000. She is garage kept and has her regular maintenance. I've never had any major issues. I believe there were 2 or 3 recalls which the dealership fixed right up with no problems. One of the dash lights where there gas gauge is located died about 2 years after I got her but it wasn't worth the price to pay to have it fixed, I can see the gauge with no problem so that never became a real problem.  She is super fun to drive, so much so my husband likes to drive her on the weekends. She's zippy, easy to handle, small enough to fit just about anywhere but yet it's roomy enough to fit a bike in the back with the back seats down. The AWD is great, we live in Central Florida and get lots of rain and I've always felt safe. My teenage daughters learned to drive in my car and have always felt comfortable. If I could I would buy a newer model but for now I will stick with my lil baby. When I see her in the parking lot I still think she looks so cute, sporty and fun. Mine is pearl white and has tinted windows which makes it look really sharp. When I see others without the tint I think it looks unfinished for some reason.
Now the cons on her are all cosmetic. I still have the factory stereo which sounds great but there isn't a USB or Aux input for my iphone so I had to purchase a compatible plug which wasn't a problem. I'm sure I'll probably put a bluetooth stereo in soon. The other con is no front arm rest, so I purchased one online that sits in the middle holder and has a compartment. Also it seats 5 but the back seat isn't really comfortable for 3 adults. I got lucky and had 3 children but they did always complain it was uncomfortable and the headrests had to be raised up which was bad from me as the driver because I had a hard time seeing out the back window.
I love this car and will love her til she gives out on me which hopefully won't be for a long time.

**UPDATE: 6-13-17 I still own my car but my 18 year old daughter drives it about 90% of the time. She loves it and has decided that instead of her purchasing a new vehicle she would like to buy mine and for me get a new car. Only reason I would give it up is because I feel it's a safe, reliable, well maintained car for her and she's very comfortable in it to drive to college. She's 5'4"" about 135lbs and she says it's the perfect fit for her. We did put an aftermarket bluetooth stereo so that was a big bonus for her.***OH Knock on Wood!!! No mechanical issues, we thought there was an oil leak but turned out the oil filter got loose.

I saw a picture of it on a local website and it had me intrigued from the start.
It's a very small vehicle compared to what I normally buy, but don't let the small size fool you.
I am six foot and I have plenty of room and do not feel cramped at all.
I live in a small populated area where the nearest city is thirty minutes away and I enjoy the ride every time, especially with how good the car is on gas and how smooth it rides.

The smooth driving of the vehicle definitely makes the long rides more enjoyable.
I can make sharp turns wit"

I was T-bone on the driver side and the side air bags did not come out the front ones did but the one on my steering wheel shattered as it deployed, I was hit from the side so my side ones should of came out, these model cars needs too have a check on them before someone else gets hurt like me the doctors said I will never work again

suzuki,sx4,2008,SX4LVR, 07/31/2008,Excellent little SUV,5,"I am very happy with my choice of the SX4. I've driven Land Rovers for years, so this is a big change. I am constantly amazed at how much I can carry in this little guy. I have English mastiffs and three of them fit quite comfortably in the back. Mind you, that is about 500 lbs of dog! I am also happy with the gas mileage. I was considering the Fit, but I went for the SX4 because of the 4x4. I'm happy with my choice."
suzuki,sx4,2008,jayman2176, 07/15/2009,Great crossover for what you pay for,4,"This is kind of tricky since I owned a 28,000 dollar jetta before this car. It gets pretty good gas millage for have allwheel drive I get 28.1 though 29.0 mpg most of the time but not in winter winter I see about 20-24 mpg I live in Indiana so I see alot of snow. I love the room in this car with a wheel base of 98 I can sure fit alot of cargo with the seats down. I love the sound system I got the 9 speaker premium sound and it pretty good. Note though my jetta had a eight speaker sound system that sound just as good with better bass and had no subwoofer in it. Love the no key start now I hate using other peoples cars. Basically a good car for the 18 thousand."

I don't know why people complain about the fuel it just have a small tank costs me less then $40 to fill  up who can ask for anything more! The hatchback is perfect for everything I put in. The fold up seats expand the trunk to immense amounts. This car is fabulous perfect, and it fits me like a glove. Might not be for you but it was for me! "

We both fight over who's gonna drive the Suzuki. It's so much fun to drive and it's nice to drive on long trips. Plenty of room for my 6'3"" hubby and our 2 dogs.

Have had it to the dealer twice to replace the display consol (clock, temp etc). Cruise control doesn't hold your speed very well. I drive 55 miles daily to work so I have to get gas every three or four days. Very disappointing gas mileage for a 4 cylinder. It's only getting maybe 22 mpg at the most and the tank only holds 10 gallons of gas. I'm 6' 4"" and this car has great headroom but practically no leg room. Back seats don't fold real well. Overall a good car but it needs a few more years of improvements to be a great car. Don't recommend it to guys with long legs. "

I had 15 grand into it when i finally cut my losses and dumped it for a Honda Accord........I got 5 grand on the trade in and some dealers refused to except it on a trade in!!!  one dealer laughed at me on the phone when I said what I had to trade in and hung up in my face!!!  you can get a good deal on this car because they do not sell them in Canada anymore (THANK GOD)  but you will regret buying I can assure you of that!!! all the maintenance was up to date on this car and still it was always broken with something replaced AWD, driveshaft, major break job alternator battery and on and on the final straw was the check engine light that would stop the car almost dead on the highway twice this happened in a week and that was enough it was gone that week and I've been sleeping at night ever since!!!

suzuki,sx4,2008,raninator84, 01/02/2014,Went down hill quick...,2,"I bought this car new in 2008 for $17,800, looking for a reliable vehicle with AWD. The car was great to me for the first 60k miles. At around 70k I had a rod knock, it turned out that my motor had slipped two bearings, I took it to the dealer(under warranty) and the job required an entirely new short block! I have owned 5 vehicles and have never thrown a bearing! The car hit 100k I had a broken slave cylinder so out of warranty this was a $1300 job (over 2000 at the dealer!), and at 106k my engine has a rod knock again! I will be trading it in tomorrow for a camry to avoid the $3,000 it would take to fix again. I will never buy a Suzuki again, and if you do, listen for the rod knock!"

The Impala hit my SX4 in the rear drivers side door and ripped the left rear wheel off the Suzuki. The side impact airbags saved me from serious injury according to the police and the EMTs. "

Fits our growing family of 5 (4 adult size and one child)comfortably enough for short trips. Good on gas (getting 21.5 city driving). Lots of trunk space. Can't wait to see how it handles in the snow. For a 4 cylinder vehicle, it does great on hills."
suzuki,sx4,2008,gregg, 06/27/2008,A car you don't see every day,4,"Overall, a fine little car. Love the exterior styling, a real headturner. Interior design is very good, with high quality plastics. The car has great steering feel, and the 17 inch tires and wheels make it handle like a go-cart. The brakes will make it stop on a dime. Fuel economy is very good, could improve though. Suzuki needs a 5 speed auto in place of the 4 speed. I'm surpassing the city estimates easily, but the highway number seems pretty accurate. Suzuki needs a bit stronger air-conditioner, it takes  longer than I would like to cool down the inside on a hot day. Also, the stereo sounds great with CD's, but the radio needs stronger reception. Engine is almost as smooth as a honda 4."

The reverse shifting gear was hard to function from outset. When I asked about it, Suzuki people told it's designed like that only. When it ran 4900 km,just before second free service, the shifting gear (reverse) got jammed. To add further woes, water started pouring into front cabin from the bottom.."

Downside, after 2 years I have valves tapping in the motor.. traded this in on a Subaru WRX instead. Overall the engine is my biggest complaint.. it has no power and I only got about 21.6 MPG out of it... honestly pick one or the other stink at MPG or stink at power not at both! Handles better than my Jeep in snow and ice, good reliable boring family car. For a 10-20k car it does its job but if you drive > 40MPH ever... find something better. "

suzuki,sx4,2008,Larry Kaplan, 09/06/2019,A Good Idea Gone Bad,1,"This car turned out to be a big disappointment.  It drives well -- I have the manual transmission and it is very responsive.  It has good sight lines.  However, the first thing I noticed was poor fit and finish, albeit minor.  However, the major problem is that the engine needs rebuilding after only 90,000 miles -- the valve seals and cylinder rings need replacement.  Because of Suzuki's bankruptcy and exit from the North American market, it is difficult to find replacement parts or a rebuilt motor, so I will be junking the car under CA's cash for clunkers law.

Good on gas if you drive like you want it to be. I find the seats very comfortable, better than the Prius I was going to buy at twice the price. Cabin noise is quite low for this class, engine is smooth, doors shut with solid thump.  9- speaker stereo is excellent.  Front end styling is great, back end could use a little more edginess to it. Very intriguing little vehicle. Suzuki, I wish you would replace rear differential with brushless DC motor along with smaller engine and make it a mild hybrid. I just might do it for you Suzuki!"
suzuki,sx4,2008,Cheyenne Driver, 10/02/2008,A great decision to buy this car,4,"We bought this car for safety, air bag protection, and traction in snow and ice in Wyoming.

The exterior paint is ""cheap & sensitive"" (scratches down to the metal extremely easily, I have had to pay for protectant because of bird droppings marking it). The interior ""plastic"" (dash, doors)scratch extremely easily, and the upholstery snags like mad as well.  The little windows on the front sides create blind spots.  The window sticker when I bought it said avg mpg 30 highway and I have not ever gotten above 25-26mpg.  Small gas tank. Cruise control is not standard neither are arm rests.  Not terribly comfortable. Hard to handle in strong winds. Back seat not much leg room.  Not ""family"" car"
suzuki,sx4,2008,sr500mark, 04/02/2013,This is a great little car.,4,"I bought this for its mileage and 4 wheel drive ability.

I'd get the manual tranny."
suzuki,sx4,2008,SX4 kicks butt !!!, 05/09/2008,Great car,5,"Honestly, I had never owned a Suzuki and was kind of reluctant to purchase one simply because I was not familiar with these vehicles Oh boy, Have I been pleasantly surpised! This car keeps getting great reviews from friends, not to mention the great perks it came with, and the much needed, built-in bluetooth system. On a normal work week, I used to fork out about 60 bucks for gasoline (California), Now after the first week of owning and driving the car guess what? So far, I have only put 35 bucks of gas and still has little less than half a tank left. Cannot beat this deal!"

Right front stabilizer bar broke. Car still makes a weird clunk when turning and rattles when it goes over bumps. Dealership is horrible for warranty. The passenger air bag light says off when passenger is in seat with seat belt on. Dealership unpluged battery and said all is well, I get 20 miles down the road and it does the same thing. Very unsafe vehicles. Road bumps will throw car around. Good luck going thru snow. Doesn't even handle 4"". All around poor vehicle. No more Suzuki for me."

I'm still grinning! For the 3 months I've had it, I'm averaging around 28 mpg with a good mix of highway and city commuting. It's hard to find something that I'm not pleasantly surprised with. The acceleration, performace, smooth ride, handling, braking, etc. took away my apprehensions of driving a small economy car. And, it's simply fun to drive. It has a unique, sporty look that sets it apart from others in it's class. In my view, it has the best quality ratio of all it's competitors.

I originally looked at a Mazda 3, but for the same price and options as the SX4 I would have ended up with a used Mazda 3 with 30,000 miles on it.  For the money its hard to beat the SX4, good gas mileage, nice interior, warranty, 17"" alloys, and more.  I drive a lot in town and the highway for my job and I have been averaging 28 mpg combined.  If you are looking in Ft. Collins, CO I recommend Dellenbach, they were extremely nice and didn't pressure me while looking"

After compare with the price and warranty, the SX4 is the final winner. This car is easy to handle and with about 30 MPG (city and highway combine) but shakes between 65-80 miles/hr. Took it back and Suzuki dealer spend two day to work on it. I picked up the car and they told me it was the balance problem of the tires which is not true.

I had a modified Subaru and the Suzuki hugs the curves just as good in stock form. Not the fastest car on earth but it will put a smile on your face. So far we have put nearly 5000 miles on the odometer with no issues. Our sedan has the optional 17"" black painted wheels with machined face and they really set the car apart. With the addition of front fog lamps it looks great. So far gas mileage is on par with the sticker but we have yet to get over 30mi to a gallon even on a 175 mile one way trip to the beach we never got over 26mi to a gallon. "

Being my first new car it has been the best compared to my 91 Lincoln Mark 7 and my 95 Mazda 626. It feels like you're doing laps around a go-cart track. It's always eager to downshift wich makes it hit that right note at all times. My mom even wanted to borrow it and she has a 07 BMW 3 series. She loved it until she crashed it. Wasn't anything major but the front bumper, radiator, grill and headlight needed replcing and she still rides the same if not better then the day I got her. It's funny how the first accident my mom's ever gotten in. It had to be my brand new SX4 but you wouldn't even notice the dealership did an excelent job, another great thing about SX4"
suzuki,sx4,2008,napagreg, 09/26/2008,A Great Performer,4,"I test-drove the Chevrolet Cobalt, Mazda 3, and Nissan Sentra. For the money, the Suzuki SX4 Sport is the best. The Cobalt would have cost $20 less a month (purchase), but was the no- options, manual-windows-and-all version in white (no other colors available at that dealer). The Mazda 3 was fun, and well optioned. But it was $20 more a month. The Nissan was funny. Neat interrior, but weird seats and looks. And it was about $30 more a month. Now, the Suzuki SX4 Sport had all the options of the Mazda 3, the cool interior similar to the Sentra, and only a little more expensive than the base-model Cobalt. The paint is fantastic, I got the dark grey. And it drives like a sport sedan. "

The front tires aren't even feathering which seems to be an issue on other makes I have owned. Suggested Improvements - This is all based on the SX4 Sport Sedan - Sunroof option, remote start, leather seating with heated seats,  auto up & down windows on all four windows, auto locking doors at 15 mph & auto unlocking doors when shifted into park, auto on/off headlights, smaller keyless remote that doesn't take up some much room in your pocket, longer wheel base to improve looks & give more rear seat leg room, better gas mileage with better acceleration, larger fuel tank for longer driving "
suzuki,sx4,2008,Eddian!, 12/22/2007,Soo well rounded...,4,"Its so hard to classify this car, to match it with the ""competition"". Maybe it's because its on its own territory. Its a well rounded car - excellent value, outstandingly-well equipped, smart match of performance vs fuel economy that produces a car that exceeds and outperforms the others in everything except the price. Note: its not as fuel-economic as a Toyota Corolla but delivers more power and sporty-feeling, without being as pricy as a Mazda3. The most oustanding features is are the great ride quality and handling and Suzuki's 100k/7ys fully-transferable warranty."

This car is very similar to the RAV in many respects, small 4 cylinder engine, AWD, about the same size but a little lower to the ground.  The SX4 gets decent mileage so far after about 600 miles we are getting about 21 mpg in town and have not taken it for any long rides yet.  My wife likes pretty much everything about the car except the lack of an ashtray and the auto climate control is a little confusing at first.  Some of the controls do not light up when the headlights are on, such as the steering wheel controls for the radio and cruise control. "

You get a lot of car for much less money than other brands. 17"" wheels, fog lamps, smart pass entry & keyless start, rear spoiler, ground effect spoilers all around.

suzuki,sx4,2008,Lakebear, 12/24/2008,Great Little Car,4,"I have had the car for 10 months now and I still love it. It has been great in the ice and snow. I have gotten up hills that other cars were slipping and sliding on. The traction control and anti-lock breaks have kept me going in a straight line when other cars in front and behind me have been fishtailing. In addition to being very reliable and safe, it is a blast to drive. It is so comfortable that my husband always wants me to drive even though his Saturn gets better gas mileage. I'm averaging 27 MPG and I drive 100 miles a day back and forth to work. I test drove a Honda Fit and Civic because they got better gas mileage but they just didn't feel as substantial as the SX4."
suzuki,sx4,2008,JLEEGOD, 02/01/2009,GREAT LITTLE CAR,5,"I looked at the Mazda 3, the Toyota Corolla and the Nissan Sentry before I settled happily on the Suzuki SX4. This is a great car. I never understood it when people said a car can be ""fun to drive"" until now. The shifting is smooth and seamless, the car is very peppy and responsive and the acceleration leaves nothing to be desired. I enjoy getting in my car to go anywhere now. The quality of the car is great too. It feels solid and firm and is solid on the road. The cockpit is roomy and very comfortable. The stereo system and sound is just right. Everything just feels right with this car. The gas milage is very good. I do a lot of city driving and I'm getting 28 mpg in the city. "
suzuki,sx4,2008,SX4dude1, 01/30/2009,Worth a test drive! easy to own,3,This is my second Suzuki and I am rather impressed I purchased a  Forenza and I will say the SX4 is a huge improvement in so many ways. The car is actually fun to drive with unique style and its easy to own I have had this car for about a year now and I have had no issues with the car so far. This has been one of my favorite cars to own so far. The 4 speed auto is a bit sluggish to respond and the lack of an auto stick type trans was a bit disapointing but it still gets the job done. There is just enough horse power to get you onto the highway and above legal posted limits quickly so this car is no slug. From a red light the car may not seem to be to impressive just wait and see
suzuki,sx4,2008,OnTheRoad, 02/03/2009,"First 20,000 miles",3,"Runs ok in slow driving areas. Not good in California, 4 speed transmission needs all it has for Highway Driving. Windshield broke by itself at 13,000 miles, nothing hit it, The Dealer said it is not covered by the Warranty. It fishtails if you need to swerve because runs in front of car, at 40 mph. Gas for me is 29 MPG. The GPS stopped working and needed to be replaced at 10,000 miles. The fender needed to be fixed because it was coming apart at 2000 miles. This car is problematic. Next time I'm going to a Honda or older Oldsmobile or Buick or VW.  "
suzuki,sx4,2008,talisman, 03/06/2009,SX4 Sport - Long Term,4,"My Ocean Blue SX4 Sport now has 16000 miles. Its been very comfortable, fairly reliable, and still gets looks and compliments on its styling. Rear seat needs to fold down. At first, I thought that the trunk was huge, but the lack of a fold-down rear seat is a huge pain. Rear seat legroom is tight, and you will need BOTH hands on the wheel on windy days. The car is very sensitive to crosswinds, especially at high speeds. Fuel mileage has averaged 26.7 mpg in mostly interstate driving, which is good, not great."
suzuki,sx4,2008,Renee' Brown, 03/14/2009,2008 Suzuki SX4,4,A good dependable vehicle for a good price. Also came with a great warranty and road side assistance. This is the first Suzuki I've owned and I would recommend it tomy family and friends.
suzuki,sx4,2008,Edward, 05/04/2009,Charming but...........,4,"I bought this car for my wife who had just learned to drive (foreigner) and she absolutely loves it. It is spacious for a small car with plenty of room in the trunk for a full size suit case laid down flat.  The car lacks power which they advertise as more than a MINI, but you really have to put your foot into it or use gear 1 to launch it and to merge onto Interstate traffic.  Radio is sufficient (4 speaker single Cd player)  Head room is great for tall people we are not  AWD is not perm. but can be locked in as long as driving below 30mph.  I had a 350z before this so this car can not be compared to but is still funish to drive."
suzuki,sx4,2008,BrendanB, 05/23/2009,2008 Suzuki SX4,4,"I purchased this car for my first car, and it is pretty impressive considering the price. At first, it felt very slightly underpowered, considering that I was used to driving a car with 260 horsepower, but in reality, it isn't bad. The handling on it is amazing. It takes turns quickly and the tires stick to the road well. I live in Pennsylvania, and the traction control and AWD make it a very good car for snow. Also, the touring package comes with a 9-speaker 6-CD changer, which sounds amazing. It is probably one of the best car stereos I've heard. The only small downside is I have only been getting 20 mpg, but that's using full throttle a lot. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase."
suzuki,sx4,2008,Bob Seifert, 01/03/2008,SX4,4,"Bought car new, a very nice car for the price and very well equipped. I am very happy with the car so far,and would recommend it to anyone."
suzuki,sx4,2008,Kevin, 01/07/2008,"Sporty, yet practical",4,So far I have almost nothing but love for my new SX4.  It is very fun to drive.  Low displacement allows for high reving with good mileage.  It also corners very nicely and has many comfortable features.
suzuki,sx4,2008,rick (pgh pa), 01/05/2008,One Week Old,4,Only one week old with 350 miles. First tank of gas 23.89 vs my old envoy of 15. Love how it handles and great visablility. Front seats very comfortable. I drive 50-75 miles a day in mixed. It looks like the 2nd tank is around 28 mpg. I love it. Wife has ford escape 2003. Might buy another one.
suzuki,sx4,2008,Bob ( Florida ), 06/15/2009,Best car for the money and fun to drive,5,"This is one of the best cars that I have owned. Fun to drive very responsive, lots of interior room, a very good ride for a smaller car. With all the extras like climate control,cruise control, outside temp. indicator, computer for milage P/G and fuel distance left in tank, all the control are handy. Suzuki did a fine job putting this vehicle together. I would recommed that anyone looking for a car take a good look at this one before making your mind up on a purchase of a car like this."
suzuki,sx4,2008,DavidW, 07/09/2009,Under the radar value,4,"This car is an amazing deal and has been terrific so far!  It flies under the radar screen because Suzuki doesn't seem to promote their cars too well. I'm glad I did the research and found it.  After 7,000 miles, no problems at all and I love driving it!"
suzuki,sx4,2008,Ron, 01/29/2008,Excellent small car,4,"Very nice car to drive, has lots of features for the price. More power and torque than some of the other brands, Seems roomy to me as far as the interior goes, decent stereo system, easy to get in and out doors,  This is my third Suzuki from the same dealership. I traded in a fuel hungry Truck for this car, I've gotten up to 34 MPG on the freeway but mostly avg 30 MPG combo driving. Really great visibility windows."
suzuki,sx4,2008,Stacey, 09/01/2009,17' Inch tires are really bad,4,"I love driving my car, however I have put on 17,000 miles and I am getting ready to put on the 3rd set of tires. Dealership says these cars eat tires and I agree! At $200.00 a pop for 205/50R17 they are expensive!"
suzuki,sx4,2008,Indiana Gal, 10/14/2009,I must disagree - I love this car,4,"I have to reply to a couple of earlier posts. I get from 26.5 to 29 mpg on my daily driving (40 miles round trip) so I was surprised about the rating. Also I'm still driving on the first set of tires at 17,500 miles. I read a review that listed 3 sets of tires in the first 20,000 miles. It does seem to have blind spots when trying to back up, but overall it is easy to drive and easy to park. It has a huge trunk, large enough for luggage for 4 on a 5 day trip. I bought this used with 7,000 miles and now over 17,000 and have not had any repairs at all."
suzuki,sx4,2008,stockton2007, 10/31/2009,Great Value,4,"Purchased new in May 08.  Base sport sedan, 5spd, no options.  Total discounts $1700 + free gas card and 0% for 60 mo = Fansatic Deal. The car is great for its' class, huge trunk, excellent headroom, backseeat fits my son's car seat well.  Interior is a clean look but lots of plastic (remember the $15k price).  exterior is stylish and actually has alloy wheels!  MPG is 25-27 which isn't bad but is low for this catagory of cars.  It has some pep with the 5spd but is by no means ""fast"".  Drives well and has a decent feel for the road.  Has had good traction in rain and snow even with the FWD sedan.  "
suzuki,sx4,2008,mountainlife, 11/03/2009,Good snow car but rattles,4,This is the second Suzuki I have owned. The first one (Sidekick) was tough as nails and very reliable. We put over 100k tough miles on it with virtual no repairs. I hope the same for this one. The engine takes a while to break in and I have noticed an increase in mileage and performance after ~20k miles. It is not quick but will pull the 10 mile grade up to my house with the cruise on and set to 70 mph. I live in the mountains and it really snows up here. The factory tires were terrible and wore out quickly. I replaced them with Michelin's which are great. The car rides and handles great but it has several rattles after one year. For the money it is a good buy but I just hate rattles.  
suzuki,sx4,2008,Wasack, 11/20/2009,Little but roomy,4,"I'm a large man and getting in and out of the SX4 is a bit of a clown act but once inside it's quite roomy and comfortable.  Adequate leg room and I can even wear a cap if I so desire.  Mileage has averaged 26/29.  Slow down a bit and get 33mpg hwy.  Handling is excellent even in windy conditions.  Currently 24,000 on the clock and it's not required any maintenance. The only thing irritating is the red panel lights.  Very hard to see on sunny days.  The steering wheel controls are not lit making their use difficult at night.  Would I buy another one?  You betcha!  Great value for the dollar."
suzuki,sx4,2008,Rich, 11/26/2009,Great car,4,Had a Chrysler 300 and sold it when gas went over $4.00/gal. Great car for the money and increased the mpg by putting in. a K and N air filter. Now get 36 mpg highway. Fun ride and comftorable and still get looks from others. Suzuki should do more to promote their car line. Give it a look. Great car.
suzuki,sx4,2008,Shelltop, 12/01/2009,Great Car for a Great Price w/ toys,4,"I stumbled upon this car after looking at Hondas and Corollas with  higher price tags but bare bone.    I have been pleasantly surprised I got this car for $11k.. power windows, radio, large ""roomy"" interior feel. I'm happy with the purchase. The extra window front panel was weird initially but I see more copycats out there.  I recommend taking a look at this brand."
suzuki,sx4,2008,Happy in NJ, 01/04/2010,GREAT LITTLE CAR,5,"I have the 2008 Suzuki SX4 4-door sedan 5-speed manual with Touring package. I researched a lot of cars and read tons of reviews before I settled on the SX4. The value of the car brand new in Feb 2009 was $18k. I paid about $16k after all taxes and all fees.  I have never regretted it for a second. It drives great, it has never had any problems and I'm still happy with it after 11 months. It has traction control which comes in very handy in NJ in snow, icy roads and rain. I get about 30 mpg combined city and highway driving consistently. The trunk has a lot of space and the inside is roomy. Overall this is a great car with loads of features for a good price."
suzuki,sx4,2008,Mike, 02/12/2010,SX$ Cross Over,3,"Car was great for 15000 miles then the rattles in the dash area began....awful, selling dealer did not even fill the windsheild wiper reservoir dealer no help....Fuel economy for such a compact car is barely 27mpg for me. Eats tires, if you go studded tires with AWD and Traction control its awesome in ice and snow. If you roll windows down you cant here anything at all. Windows dont defrost well, very small fuel tank.Wish I would have bought a VW Rabbit"
suzuki,sx4,2008,Ran, 07/06/2010,2008 Suzuki SX4 4dr Wagon AWD Automatic,3,"Recently purchased the car from carmax for $10k and didn't feel like I was being ripped off from a dealership and so far it's been great. It gives me everything that I really need. Automatic Windows, a/c, and reliability. I've owned many other cars but as I've ""matured"" this car is perfect for me right now. Doesn't go fast therefore eliminating speeding tickets, definitely within my reduced budget from a few years ago, and it takes me from point a to point b. "
suzuki,sx4,2008,rforrister, 07/21/2010,"85,000+ miles and counting",4,I drive this car 108 miles a day.  Avg 32 mpg.  This is the best car I have ever purchased.  I took it to Colorado and it had no problem pulling the mountains.  For those who say the engine is not strong enough.  Purchase a K&N Air filter made a world of difference in the cars performance.  
suzuki,sx4,2008,noynoyjohn, 02/01/2008,A great AWD car,4,This is a great car-nimble and fun to drive. Have it for 3 months and so far I have encountered no problems. I really like its keyless feature-you don't need to insert key to start the engine (like an expenssive car).  It's highly recomended.
suzuki,sx4,2008,bow, 02/16/2008,From 4x4 dakota quad to grocery getter,4,"Traded in a 2004 dakota quad cab loaded (fuel reasons).  Love the suzuki.  Wish it had a bigger gas tank.  No problem doing over 100 mph.  Back seat is not really ideal for a baby seat, very tight.  Goes anywhere (so far) in the Pittsburgh area winter.  Purchased in oct 07.  suspension is not too good with the potholes in sw PA.  Handles very well.  Cup holders questionable. "
suzuki,sx4,2008,DKspokane, 02/27/2008,Brand New Car for my Honey,4,"I could write way more than I'm allowed. I have owned MANY new cars in my life (mostly for business). We have only had this a few days, but I have to admit that I think I would like it for myself rather than letting my wife keep it! This ""car"" is solid, the power is fine, the idle is silkly smooth, the ride is exceptional, the fuel economy is GREAT for an AWD/4X4, the safety features are awesome, and the value is better than anything I have ever seen, ever. It doesn't have the acceleration of a V6 or the fuel mileage of a hybrid, but it is F-U-N! I will try to update this more later."
suzuki,sx4,2008,fsj2, 10/22/2007,2008 SX4,4,"I have 2000 miles on my SX4 now and it just keeps getting better. I have all the bells and whistles. Like XM radio, mp3 hook up, 9 speaker sound, 6 disk CD. Also the cold-air intake, underdrive pulley and the piggyback ECU. The SX4 is very fun to drive. The switchable FWD, AWD and 4WD lock is great! "
suzuki,sx4,2008,TalismanPHL, 11/15/2007,SX4 Sport Sedan w/Auto,4,"Had the car about a week and am very pleased with it so far. Smallish backseat area though; needs another couple inches of legroom. Outstanding highway power and ride, about 26 mpg on the last tank of gas, but the car only has 1100 miles on it, so that should improve. I got compliments from everyone at work on the styling of the car - one guy told me it looks like a European rally race car! "
suzuki,sx4,2008,steeler fan, 11/05/2007,A Cute Little Bug,5,"This is  my first new car (& I'm pushing 50) so I have driven many cars over the years!! I have to tell you, I just love this little ""bug"" (what my family calls her). I've already taken it on a 350+ trip and had to keep watching my speed - after finding myself going over 75 a few times!! Yes, merging back onto the interstate wasn't the fastest, but let's remember what we were driving folks - a great little 4 cyl. that is fun to drive and got great mileage right out of the gate! The stereo sounded good, and I do like the auto climate controls. I can't wait to see how ""she"" does in our western PA winters! Definitely a keeper I think!"
suzuki,sx4,2008,talisman, 11/20/2007,SX4 Sport Sedan with Automatic,4,Car is brand new with only 1900 miles driven so far. Fuel mileage was 29 mpg in mostly highway driving (75 mph) on the last tank of gas. Just drove from Los Angeles to Phoenix and found that it has plenty of passing power and a firm but controlled ride. The deep metallic blue color looks awesome on this car - I received 2 compliments on the car's looks when I was at a rest stop.
suzuki,sx4,2008,Steelers fan, 11/18/2007,A Cute Little bug..,4,"That's what it reminds me of sitting in the driveway, a cute little bug. I've already taken it on a trip to Erie and I thought it great on the highway. A very zippy little car!I did a ton of research on the internet before purchasing what I consider to be my last new car, mainly looking for 4cyl., AWD and relatively cheap! It's a great little 4 cylinder with AWD. It'll never have the speed my '70 camaro had but at least I can actually pass by the gas station all week long! So far I have not been disappointed. I can't wait to see how it does in our PA winters!"
suzuki,sx4,2008,SeattleSX4, 03/31/2008,Excellent Car,4,"Handling is excellent. Steering provides excellent feedback and control in pointing the car where I want it to go. The acceleration is fine. From a standstill, I have no problems and its even quite peppy. The four-wheel disk brakes are excellent. Highway cruising is nice and quiet. Visibility is better than any other car Ive ever driven. Gas mileage is not great, especially when driving up a lot of hills. Ive gotten 18-27mph, with mostly 20-21mph. The front seats are very comfortable for both short and long trips. Lateral support is very good. Dash controls are large, easy to read, and easy to use with just a quick glance. Rear storage is decent and versatile."
suzuki,sx4,2008,Jesse , 03/31/2008,Great for its Price,4,"This car is really a comfortable ride, it can be bumpy at times, but other than that is is a real fun time to drive, this car is fuel economic, but not as good as someone would expect. The car has an OK acceleration speed for its price, it can get from 0-60 in about 9.52 seconds, it is really stylish, and has a nice look to it, I would recommend this car to new driver that is looking for a fun ride, at a low cost."
suzuki,sx4,2008,CtYank42, 12/10/2007,My Little White Tank,5," This is my third Suzuki automobile, having owned an 88 Chevy Sprint and a 93 GEO Metro.  While the little three bangers were great on gas, and very dependable, they weren't nearly as well built and fun to drive as my SX4 Sport.  One of the reasons I bought another Suzuki - my seventh including four motorcycles - is the build quality of the Japanese built models.  I considered a Forenza and a Verona but I wasn't comfortable with the quality control reports on the South Korean built cars.   My SX4 Sport has two wheel drive (all the four sedans are 2WD) and it handles better than any small car I've ever owned, including an 02 SVT Focus.   I haven't averaged less than 31MPG in 3000 miles. Fun"
suzuki,sx4,2008,dcnpcfl, 04/07/2008,2008 SX4 Southeast regional version FWD,4,So far it has been a lot of fun to drive and is getting good mileage which is what I was looking for. I have owned Suzuki's in the past with great reliability and value. For the price it is a hard to beat vehicle.
suzuki,sx4,2008,cd-IL, 04/11/2008,My microSUV,4,This is a good all-weather hatchback car that wouldn't break your bank. It is the same car platform used in World Racing Championship series (w/ exception of turbo engine and vented hood) that had placed 7th at its initial entry. This is fun to drive and suspension is great for a small car and very stable when driven at high speed. I got 23 mpg of mixed driving which is not bad for an AWD car. My wife and I use this as our daily runabout car that is safe to drive through the worst winter conditions in Chicago. This little bug can trek on 5-in snow while most comparable priced sedans spins on the road. The all-weather capability and safety features had the most weight in our decision to buy.
suzuki,sx4,2008,Connie, 04/18/2008,SX4 - Fun to Drive,4,"This car is my 5th Suzuki and the best one so far!  It's easy to park, drive with great visibility with all the windows. The color (copper) is what attracted my attention, but I love the keyless entry and ignition too!  Mostly town driving and am getting 23 to 24 mpg. "
suzuki,sx4,2008,MELYNDA, 04/30/2008,I love my Suzuki SX4,4,I had a lot of expensive cars and fast cars. I compare the turning ratio on my Suzuki to my BMW 525xi. I love the stylish interior it reminds me of an Audi. I get great gas mileage. I live in south Jersey and I go to New York every weekend. I can fill up my gas tank on a Sunday and still have a quater of a tank left by Wednesday. For the price you cant beat all the features and benefits that comes with the SX4
suzuki,sx4,2008,Gene W., 05/01/2008,Mini-Cooper on Steroids!,5,"The SX4 Crossover should be advertised as a ""Mini-Cooper on Steroids!""  This little beauty is fun-omenal to drive!  These cars are so agile and responsive, you'd think you were on a Go-Cart Track!  The handling is absolutely marvelous! Trading my '07 Hyundai Accent Hatchback for the SX4 Crossover, was a smart thing to do!  The SX4 has superb power and a comfortable ride. I preferred the convenience package for my needs, while my wife took the touring package.  We are both extremely happy with our choices, and still can't get over how Suzuki was able to cram so much value in such a small package!  Thanks Suzuki!  After owning 5 Hyundai's, I'm sold on Suzuki!"
suzuki,sx4,2008,Big Daddy Mack, 05/08/2008,Crazy About My Crossover,5,"Man I love this car! It looks small outside, but is it ever big on the inside. All the standard features in this car are awesome (see favorites). Who would believe I could get a gas saving AWD, fully loaded, for less than a Nissan Versa, Honda Fit, Hyundia Elantra, or a Toyota Matrix. "
suzuki,sx4,2008,Kevin, 05/11/2008,"Good mileage, stable ride",5,"Just drove cross from the mid-west to the east coast (1,313 miles). Got between 34 MPG (when I kept more or less to the speed limits) and 32 MPG (when I ignored them - i.e., 70-80 MPH). Car was fully loaded with heavy luggage (I was surprised how much it held, it didn't look that big). Handles well in strong cross winds at highway speed despite its high profile. Very stable when passing big trucks."
suzuki,sx4,2008,LakebearOH, 05/13/2008,Great CR-V replacement,4,"I thought I would keep my Honda CR-V forever. It was 10 years old but I didn't like anything else out there (including the new ones). Sat in the SX4 Crossover at the Auto Show in Cleveland and fell in love. I'm getting 28 MPG driving back and forth to work. I do wish it had a bigger gas tank because with the miles I drive (over 400 a week) I have to fill up twice a week, but otherwise I love this car. It is quieter than my Honda and rides very nice. I've gotten quite a few complements on it and a lot of questions because there aren't many Suzuki dealerships in the area."
suzuki,sx4,2008,Nathan Schrock, 05/14/2008,My First Brand New Vehicle,4,"I have owned the car for about a month now. I've got almost 2,000 miles on it. My first complaint is that the acceleration really is poor, but the vehicle handles corners very well which helps equal out the poor acceleration. The vehicle's IAWD and 4X4 lock works well and the vehicle is virtually impossible to get stuck in snow or mud."
suzuki,sx4,2008,Gregg, 05/14/2008,A great little CUV,4,"The SX4 crossover has mostly met my expectations or in some cases exceeded them. I have read lots of complaints about road noise, for example, but I find it to be a quiet and smooth cruiser for its size. Careful driving has given me an overall mpg of 30. (Quick starts and remaining in a lower gear will drop the mileage quickly.) The instant mpg readout helps you re- adjust driving habits. Staying under 70 on the highway also yields very good numbers. It handles great and is ""toss- able,"" adding to the fun factor. Plus, parking is a breeze."
suzuki,sx4,2008,Mark, 05/16/2008,From Forenza to SX4,5,I just traded in an 06 Forenza for the SX4. All I can say is wow what a diffrence. I love this vehicle. the way it handles and drives is no comparison to the Forenza. I have the top of the line Touring Edition it's well worth the extra money for the options you get. The keyless entry and start are really good. I would reccomend this car to anyone looking for a great car for good value.
suzuki,sx4,2008,Taiino59, 05/20/2008,SX4 w/con/package auto.,3,"I currently own a 2005 Toyota Camry, and I get better gas mileage in my Camry than my new SX4.  No arm rest, no place to put items inside of the car.  I was really disappointed with the gas mileage for such a small car.  Limited positions setting on the drivers seat.  "
suzuki,sx4,2008,DRSPINE, 05/21/2008,A well rounded car,5,I have had the car for six weeks and have put 3000 miles on it so far. The handling is better than my Volvo C30. The gas mileage is between 26.5 and 27.5 mpg in suburban driving. For a small car at a reasonable price you cannot beat the ride quality and the handling. I can't wait to see the improvements on this touring II in future years.
suzuki,sx4,2008,Patrick, 05/29/2008,Biggest Little Car Ever! The SX4 Sedan!,5,"I have the vivid red SX4 Sedan w/ conv & auto. I've owned over 150 cars in my life. New, used, old, big & small. This car really takes the cake for value, comfort, looks, performance, etc.  I could go on and on. (Okay, I will!) I am 6' 350lbs and I fit! No tipping the head to get in or reach out and close door. (Big guys know what I mean.) I can easily open the door in the parking garage and slip in and out since the doors are so short. Glass everywhere. Feels like a greenhouse. Tall seating feels like you're in an SUV. Handles excellent. Easy to drift if you want. Sharp appearance. Beats Toyo, Nissan, Subies and most other small cars in the looks, ride and standards department."
suzuki,sx4,2008,Rusty Franklin, 05/30/2008,Mid-Life crisis car,4,"I just sold my 19 year old Civic with 165k miles on it. This is a nice step up. Sharp looking car. Gotten comments on it's looks. Comfortable ride for a small car. 17"" tires help the ride and looks. The steering wheel controls are great. Climate controls are positioned nicely. Trunk is large. Motor has plenty of power for me. I've put 1750 miles on it in 1 1/2 weeks and it is getting 32 mpg on the highway. Good head room in the front. Would recommend this car to anyone. I feel I got a good value for my money. I hope to have for well over 100k miles."

Later after a $500 tow to Denver they said the piston rod went right through the engine block.

Well at that one there were no Suzuki dealers left in Wisconsin to do and oil change.

Traded a 4-cyl Ford Ranger for the SX4.
Gas mileage for both vehicles is the same:
27 city/30 highway.
However the SX4 has AWD, a primary reason for the purchase.
It supposedly carries the lowest MSRP of any AWD vehicle sold in the U.S.
Although after owning the SX4 six months, nothing on it appears cheap.
The glowing consumer reviews on Edmunds sealed the deal (thanks Edmunds readers).


It is a tall vehicle which probably explains the high wind noise which becomes annoying at speeds greater than 80mph.
Also the engine needs a"
suzuki,sx4,2009,Jen Hunt, 05/31/2017,Love my Suzuki!!!!,5,"This car has been the best car I have owned!  Good gas mileage, low repair cost, great in rain and snow!  Love the AWD!  I have not had to do a repair besides maintenance, new tires, and brake pads until I hit 150,000 miles.  I have had this car up in the mountains, commuting, etc..  I needed a new transmission at 152,000 miles.  It has been a great dependable car! I'm now at 170,000 and still running great! I wouldn't want any other car.

suzuki,sx4,2009,ronman114, 01/14/2011,Sharp peppy thing!,5,"We just bought this car used with 19200 miles. It is in excellent shape and feels like it just rolled off the showroom floor. Shifting is smooth and easy. Love the looks of it inside and out. Features on dash well placed and everything very visible. I like the buttons on the steering wheel but would prefer they were lit for nighttime driving. 2WD and AWD selections are amazingly easy and SO handy in bad weather. I'm sure this car handles better than those crossovers and pickups that don't have AWD. Love heated seats, higher driving position, huge windshield and heated side mirrors. So many perks for such a small price!
Cons are:wish it had better fuel economy and the gas tank is too small."
suzuki,sx4,2009,tarias, 02/25/2012,Suzuki SX4 2009 Review,4,"I'm very happy with this car. I have a family of 5 (2 adults and 3 kids under 13 years of age). We have a SUV too but we use this vehicle for most of our daily driving,trips and errands. I especially like the amount of torque the car has when carrying 5 people. You barely notice any power loss with 5 passengers and I'm not scared to get on the highway with it. We traded in a Honda CRV because of that problem.
I have 45k+ miles on it and it's been very reliable.
Aside from routine maintenance like oil changes, wiper blades and air filter, I've done nothing. Brakes will need to be changed at 50k miles. Tires need changing now at 45k. My view of Suzuki has positively changed with this vehicle"
suzuki,sx4,2009,Charlie0722, 06/05/2018,A great small crossover,5,"The first generation SX4 Crossover is a smartly styled small 5-door hatchback designed for Suzuki by the Italian firm of Italdesign Guigiaro. It is comfortable to drive and has a surprising amount of interior room. It is not a luxury car, but the interior appointments are nice and as good as what you would find in other Japanese cars of this size. The fit and finish is above par, and the materials proved to be durable to me under normal use. You can fold and flip up the rear seats to get lots of cargo carrying room with a fairly flat floor. I was the second owner of my 2009 which had the Technology package that came standard with a Garmin Nuvi navigation device cleverly built into a retractable compartment on the top of the dashboard. While it has a small screen, the voice directions are very clear, and you can download map updates from Garvin or third parties via the Internet.  The SX-4 scored well in crash tests, no doubt due to its rugged construction with front, side, and curtain air bags. It handles and brakes with precision. Its small size makes it easy to park  and drive on crowded streets, but it is stable enough for 70 m.p.h Interstate highway trips. Its acceleration is adequate. Its fuel economy is good. With 98,000 + miles on mine, there were no repairs needed except for normal maintenance like oil changes, brake pads, and a compressor for the AC (the AC gets a lot of use in hot, humid Florida). A downside is that Suzuki no longer sells passenger vehicles in north America, but they do honor the 10 year 100,000 mile powertrain warranty at a network of dealers (my warranty was still in effect when I traded it in December 2019 toward another vehicle). I that sourcing parts can be a challenge for major stuff if needed, but I did not need any, and you can find many parts and accessories on eBay, including ""dress-up"" options, many of which come from China. Mine was not equipped with All Wheel Drive (we do not get winter road conditions in Florida), but having lived before in northern climates I'd imagine that would really be good in many areas of the country with those ice and snow conditions. The resale prices are probably lower than equivalent cars due to Suzuki having gone out of business, so if you can find a low mileage SX4, I don't think you could go wrong in buying it.

suzuki,sx4,2009,peackno, 04/22/2010,GREAT Little Car!,4,"This is my first Suzuki and I couldn't be more pleased. For all of the standard equipment included, the value of this car can't be beat. I looked at and drove a lot of other small cars, but the SX4 came out on top. The 5 speed and good pickup makes it a very fun car to drive. Shifting is smooth as I buzz around town and parallel parking is a snap. I also do highway driving and it has sufficient power to hold its own. I was especially glad to have the on-demand 4WD during a VERY SNOWY winter. On several occasions, I zipped up snow-covered hills past other vehicles. NICE!  Slip control is great!  I'm getting 27-28 MPG on combined driving. I have gotten 30 MPG on highway. "
suzuki,sx4,2009,Busy Mom, 03/30/2009,Awesome little AWD car! Love it,4,"I bought this car right before winter started (I had a Toyota Matrix before) and boy was I glad!  This car is great in the snow.  It gets me where I need to be, from snowy roads in New Hampshire through crowded streets and in tight parking spots in downtown Boston.  This car is powerful, small, easy to parallel park, and fun to drive. Although it is small, it is well designed.  My son sits in the back in his toddler seat no problem.  I have also sat in the backseat, and while it isn't as spacious as a SUV of course, your feet aren't squished.  The seats and spacing is well designed."
suzuki,sx4,2009,crewchimp, 12/11/2009,Happy Suzuki Owner,4," I recently had to trade-out of my 2008 Wrangler Unlimited. My goals were to get a car which is capable of getting good gas mileage, hauling dogs, mountain-bikes, and whatever else I needed. Payments had to be moderately low, and the car needed to be reliable, comfortable and perform well. All of these are easily satisfied with the SX4. I have been averaging about 29 mpg with mixed city/highway driving. It has been very comfortable to sit in and drive. It has ample room inside for 4 and cargo room is adequate with the rear seats folded. The manual transmission is above average for a compact car, and the ergonomics are above par too. It handles well and grips the road even with stock tires."
suzuki,sx4,2009,tsloan, 06/21/2009,Bye-bye Benz,3,"I traded my 2005 C-class 4matic mercedes for touring model of the sx4 crossover.  I was wanting a smaller car with awd for the colorado winters.   I've only had the car a few days.  So far so good.  It is sporty getting around town, but it really has to work hard to get up the foothills of the Rocky Mts.  SX$ has the same fuel economy as the benz. I seriously considered the Honda Fit, but the Fit had a rough ride on even smooth roads and had horrible road noise even at low speeds.  The SX4 has a surprisingly smooth ride and minimal road noise.  It is a little more exotic than the hondas and toyotas- --at least around Denver.  The view from inside the car gives impression of a bigger car"
suzuki,sx4,2009,happycamper, 11/17/2009,Best Bang for Buck,4,"Do your research and drive a bunch of cars. I drove the Honda Element, Kia Soul, Subaru Impreza Outback Sport. Hands down this car was the best of all these cars combined. Features wise you cannot get a car with all that Suzuki offers for the price from any other car company. Find an 09 and Suzuki is giving 3k off. Find a dealer with inventory and they are willing to move the price even more. I am 6'3"" and 220lbs and I fit no problem. Easy in and out and seats are comfortable. Main reason I bought the car, traded in 2008 Dodge Avenger R/T was the lack of comfort in the Dodge(many other reason, car was a lemon). No other car in the class of small economy will give you the features SX4 does."
suzuki,sx4,2009,MtTop, 07/17/2010,Great car,5,"My son bought a used 2008 SX4, I liked it so much I bought the 2009 model.  I have bought over 10 new cars in my life, but this car is by far the MOST FUN to drive.  I've had it about a year now, and I still look forward to driving it.  It's that much fun.  Excellent AWD, used it many time in Northeast PA.  No worry about shoveling, just put it in AWD and go, let the FWD car people shovel. Plenty power for passing and cruising.  Spent many 6 hr drives to Boston and never get tired or uncomfortable driving it.  Avg about 30 mpg to and from work, 44 miles both ways, with city and interstate driving. Bought the iPod adapter and also factory fog lights.   Very easy to install.  BUY ONE!"
suzuki,sx4,2009,BC Detering, 05/17/2017,Sassy and Sensible,5,"This car was purchased primarily for its easy accessible from a wheelchair. The transition from a heavier, more comfortable American SUV was immediately apparent, yet the PURPOSE of the Suzuki was based primarily on value and ease of access, which it offers. Additional advantages immediately presented themselves: excellent gas mileage, (average 35 mpg), easy parking, (!!!), quick response, no maintenance other than regular oil changes using synthetic oil, all wheel drive handles well in rain & snow. Sassy and sensible are a great combination!

The car is now 10 years old and I have owned it for 7.5 of those 10 years.  The car currently has 145,000 trouble free miles.  The only maintenance has been oil/filter changes and a few replaced lightbulbs.  It continues to be an economical and reliable daily driver.

suzuki,sx4,2009,Jay, 03/22/2010,Amazing Value,4,"This is my first Suzuki vehicle. I owned a '02 Passat before, and wanted a more reliable & newer vehicle. However I didn't want to give up too many features.  After test driving the SX4, I instantly became a fan.  I love the small size of the car. Very easy to park and fun to drive. The AWD is outstanding in the snow. Love that it can be turned off to save fuel.  Exterior design is unique & looks very European.  The cloth seats are much more comfortable than the leather in my Passat.  Road & engine noise are somewhat intrusive.  Interior is comprised of hard plastics, however they have a high quality texture.  The SX4's engine is sufficient for a 4-cyl.  I'm obtaining around 25 mpg overall"
suzuki,sx4,2009,Bob Provencher, 10/22/2016,Lots of repairs,2,"I bought this car brand new in 2009.  A rebuilt transmission ($3,000) in 2014, replaced a/c compressor ($1,800) and water pump ($1,200) and finally a thrown rod are all the problems I had to deal with in a relatively new car.  Add to that poor gas mileage and faster than normal break and tire wear led to a pretty expensive car to operate.  Thankfully it was pretty cheap to buy brand new.  I wouldn't buy another one (if I could).

When I called Suzuki they just blew me off.
I would not recommend this car to anyone.
What a joke."
suzuki,sx4,2009,Lacy, 08/21/2009,Biggest Mistake Yet,1,"In the short while that I've owned this car, the airbag sensor has gone off---requiring the front passenger seat to be replaced.  It now squeaks continuously if someone sits in it.  The Keyless entry/start system seems to be questionable---I have now had to replace the key fobs twice because they do not recognize the car.  There are 3 small cheap plastic coverings under the back seat---one of these fell off the other day.  Apparently, the car I purchased is less than perfect.  It only has 2,000 miles on it.  I'm so wishing I could get rid of it, but I'm stuck with it for the time being.  One certainly gets what one pays for."

This car is sub-standard in quality and in performance. And to top it off, Suzuki has vacated the U.S., so good luck getting service. My closest service provider is over 2 hours away..."

So I get a 2009 SX4 Crossover with navigation, and would like to point out the differences I noticed from the 2008 Sedan, which I put over 13,000 miles on.  5-Speed: Smoother clutch action, easier to make smoother shifts.  Shifter works smoother too.  Ride: Electronic Stability Program (ESP) is also standard.  I noticed less body roll in sharp curves and a more stable ride quality.  More fun to drive!  Interior: Controls a little smoother, interior panels seem to be of better quality.  And I can't help but love the hatch with the fold-and-tumble seats, along with a rear window wiper."

Love the hatchback, you sit high looking over most cars, great visibility, had rails on top, got optional bike racks,very high quality at fraction of the cost of leading car tops. Looks sharp, have had so many compliments on this car. Upholstrey is comfortable, very supportive, fit and finish are very good. Love driving the stick, smooth shifting.

First, let's prface this with, I know the eclipse is a whole different type of car. The Soul was very nice, drove nice, and had lots of options, but was just a bit too funky for my taste. the Subarus are nice too, but for far less money i was able to get the AWD suzuki. I fell in love with it at first sight! Mine has custom leather interior, carbon graphite accents, body moldings and custom wheels, so it looks different from the run of the mill Suzuki, but even the plain version is a kick to drive!

It is scheduled to go into the shop early next week because the airbag light has come on and will not go off.  Browsing the internet blogs I have discovered that this is quite problematic for Suzuki and the SX4.  Other owners have complained that Suzuki is not honoring its warranty and are not being cooperative.  A courtesy car will most likely not be offered since the car is technically operable (just not sure how safe it is to drive? will the airbags deploy when I driving down the street?  do the airbags work?)  The fuel economy continues to be very poor.  The driver's seat is causing back pain, and I'm a healthy 38yo man."

suzuki,sx4,2009,Dodger, 01/22/2010,SX4 Upshift Nightmare,3,Do not buy an SX4 Crossover with manual shift!! When I test drove this car I noticed an odd tendency to over- rev when shifting up through the gears but put it down to my unfamiliarity with the car or to the engine being cold. I have driven stick shift cars for the last 35 years and was confident that a slight adjustment in driving style would avoid any issues. How wrong I was! The SX4 has a bizarre electronic throttle linkage that unpredictably decides to rev the engine in between gears when upshifting and no amount of adjustment in style can reliably avoid over-re
suzuki,sx4,2009,Joe Johnson, 12/25/2008,Joe J's Review Ft Lauderdale,4,"I bought the middle, tech package with 2WD  and 5-speed. The car is great fun to drive and a rare small crossover model that is actually comfortable with great seats and dash layout. I test drove the automatic, but it was boring. The 5 speed is more like a beamer in that it drives very tight, corners and hugs the road nicely and is fun. The layout of the folding seats is well designed and there's plenty of room in the back for stowing items. With auto show coupon and rebate, car is available way below dealer cost. best value in mini crossovers, under 16K for the tech package. Car even comes with loaner privileges and 3 year roadside assistance. Wish I had gotten AWD but don't need it in FL."
suzuki,sx4,2009,Keefe, 02/03/2009,The Unknown Car?,4,"This purchase was forced on me by my dying truck.  I was trying to wait until the summer but had to go car shopping a little early.  I test drove the automatic which was what I wanted.  This thing moves pretty well.  The steering is tight and very responsive. The interior has plenty of head room and the dash is very well lit.  AWD is available, but I haven't used it yet. Snow has been lite. Strange thing is people question me on why I brought this car instead of a Honda, Subaru, Ford,etc.  For me, I like to think outside of the box and not be the follower.  This car is more than what some would think.  Give it a shot before you shoot it down.  You'll enjoy the Crossover and its features."
suzuki,sx4,2009,baldwin, 06/24/2009,"Great, misunderstood car",5,"This is a great car! I've had mine for a year now, and it has run flawlessly and handles great. It very much is the crossover vehicle that it is supposed to be. It is a very small cross-over SUV. People want to compare it to sub- compacts, but it is really not in that class. It has much bigger wheels and chassis, which reduce its gas mileage, but give it much greater strength when stressed. It has a 7"" ground clearance, vs 4"" for most sedans. This car can be compared to smaller SUVs. Think of something like a Hundai Tuscon, but strip away all the hunky metal. An extremely lean frame is put onto a solid chassis. It has plenty of room for 4 people. It drives well at high speeds/ long distances."
suzuki,sx4,2009,KR, 07/16/2009,Recent buy....Loving it so far,4,"Loving the Suzuki Crossover so far. Got the loaded Touring trim. Lots and lots of extras for the money. CAN NOT beat the features for the money. Nav, heated seats and mirrors, keyless entry and start. Great safety features...insureance only went up $12/yr. Drives and handles great. Biggest for us, was the AWD. Can't wait to drive it around during a Maine winter.  We've owned Toyota, Mitsu, VW, Dodge, Pontiac.  We believe we got the best value for the money, by far, this time around.   We also love that everyone else isn't driving one. We'll see how it holds up. If it does well for a while, we plan to return for a Suzuki purchase for our other vehicle...the Equator truck to replace a Durango."

I call her Suzy and the girls like her too, they tell me she's cute. But overall, great car for the money, get yourself a Suzy and stop paying $20,000 + for Hondas and Toyotas, power windows are not even standard in the base price!

suzuki,sx4,2009,taroo, 09/16/2009,Great Purchase!,5,"Let me start w/how much I love this car. From the 34 mpg I just averaged on a trip to CA last week, to the great navigation system, the heated seats, the panoramic view, the spacious trunk space, the back seats that comfortably seat a 170 lb. Great Dane, and the AWD/2WD/Auto system that leaves me looking forward to snow - there are only 4 things I would suggest improving on: Adding a sunroof, adding a 6th gear (manual), a little more power, and more comfortable seats/headrests.   I did a lot of research & I knew what to expect. It's a lot of extra's for the money, but if you are looking for luxury, this is not the car for you.  I love my car!  Great job Suzuki!"

My SX4 is the 2009 ""Touring Edition"" sport wagon with AWD, and it had 6,000 miles on it when I bought it. I fell in love with these cars as soon as they came out (the sport wagons, not so much the sedans), and I knew that if I ever needed to get rid of my Jeep in favor of better gas mileage, this would be the car I'd get. Low and behold, my hubby and I have to move to another state with a warmer climate where I won't need 4x4 anymore, so I got my SX4! It's a great looking little car that's super fun to drive."

Today it snowed 6 inches here and I drove my ""little car"" all over the place! It handled great. the front wheel drive pulls you right through the snow. I appreciate the higher seats,it makes it easier on the hips when getting in and out. I HIGHLY recommend this car and dont believe that it only gets 20 MPH.

suzuki,sx4,2009,CarmenV, 07/18/2016,Exactly what we needed,5,"This car is reliable and compact. Doesn't sit as low as other small vehicles. The use of space is good. The design features make sense. Love the Hatchback.  It's great for a first car or if you want fuel economy. It gets decent gas mileage, not spectacular. It drives great and we are happy with our purchase.

suzuki,sx4,2009,JAT, 09/14/2016,great car for Colorado,4,"This is a perfect car for living here in Colorado Springs. The only downside is less gas mileage than I would like. But the AWD, traction control, and relatively high ground clearance means that whenever it snows or is icy, it will get you where you need to go. When you see cars pulled off the side of the road, or trying and failing to climb an icy hill, you won't have a problem keeping going. Perfect if you need to get to work or to the Denver airport in marginal road conditions. 

Update: hitting curb after a minor (airbags didn't even deploy) accident caused enough damage to front end to have it totalled. Replaced with a Nissan crossover that gets 10-15 mpg better, with all the same features I liked in the SX4.

suzuki,sx4,2009,Deborah McDaniel, 09/26/2016,Low maintenance!,4,"We were looking for a replacement for the same year and model where the engine got blown from lack of oil (new driver). In the 5 years we owned this make/model the only maintenance cost was oil changes. My college student driven neglected to change the oil and blew the engine after he moved away from home. I happily replaced it with the same make/model because I knew it would perform well and have low maintenance costs.

suzuki,sx4,2009,Brandie, 12/07/2016,"It's ok, but not after 80,000 miles",2,"This car has been wonderful - until this year (2017). My husband and I both have one of these cars. (Mine is orange, his is white) (Mine was bought brand new back in 2009, his was bought used just a year ago.) Repairs were normal wear and tear (new tires, oil changes, etc...) (Btw, we also have manual transmissions).  Well, this year came and these cars have been garbage. One day my orange, bought brand new, car suddenly wouldn't crank. Nothing. So I have to towed in. Turns out the entire freaking computer was somehow damaged. They said it could have been lightening - but we're in a severe drought, it hasn't rained in over a month. It cost me nearly 3 grand to fix. Then my husband's check engine light came on. So we took it in - the catalytic converter is going bad... and guess how much it is to fix it... 3 grand. If something else goes wrong we're trading these in for something else. I'm so disappointed. Suzuki made older cars, like the X-90 and tracker which are nearly indestructible.
Update: Late 2018
Just a year later and the computer in this car, which was completely replaced, died again. No idea why this keeps happening. The mechanic was not helpful in any way in explaining possible causes. Don't buy this car, or any Suzuki until they start selling in the U.S. again. The parts cost, and their wait time to get the parts are ridiculous.

suzuki,sx4,2009,Doug, 02/08/2018,My newest addition to the fleet,5,"I purchased my SX4 crossover about 5 months ago based on my experiences with my 2000 Esteem. After a lot of research and searching I found an AWD automatic with all the options. What a wonderful little car! It is solid, capable and a great value. In my opinion this is the only car on the market if you need something easy to get into with AWD that is inexpensive and well made. My parents are getting older and they are now considering buying the same car. My mom has back problems and she loved the ride quality and how easily she was able to get into the car. I have a Toyota Sienna and the head and door sill clearance are better on my SX4. Do yourself a favor and test drive one of these.
Update... I’ve had the car for nearly a year now and it’s been dead solid reliable. I took it on a 1000 mile trip with no issues.
Update #2 going on my 2nd year with the car. The only issue I have is some bad oil seals on the valves. In my experience this is due to poor maintenance. When I first saw the car I noticed sludge when I pulled the oil cap. I was hesitant to buy, but the price was right and it was the only one I could find with the options I wanted. The previous owner either didn’t change the oil often enough and/or used poor quality oil. I use full synthetic. Long term use cleans sludge but it also increases oil leaking past worn seals. I’ll have to take a weekend and replace the seals. That should fix the issue. But no other issues to report. Still dead reliable.

The Touring Package came with a lot of options and bought the car for 19,000. No major problems with the car, have 112,000 miles on it, never left me stranded.

suzuki,sx4,2010,ozisx4, 06/05/2014,A good car stuffed up by engineers,4,"When I studied engineering 30 years ago, one of the first things we were taught was to make frequently serviced components easily accessible. Obviously the engineers at Suzuki did not go to the same university !, try changing the cigarette lighter fuse, you have to dismantle the facia or be a contortionist, try to replace the oil filter, almost impossible to undo and retighten without special tools ! Love the car but hate working on it, also a problem with the paint on the hood, measles !!! Suzuki maintain that they are stone chips despite no similar spots on the guards etc. Suzuki aftersales service SUCKS."
suzuki,sx4,2010,Scott, 07/02/2016,Wonderful little car,5,"With 150 hp on tap as opposed to its rivals (Nissan Versa Note, 108hp, Honda Fit, 117hp and Mazda 2, 100 hp), this little buggy will get up and scoot!  And it has a six, count 'em SIX speed manual transmission!  I was looking for a car with a manual to use as a commuter, and was able to buy this 2010 (in 2016) with 71K on it for $2700!  I was pretty happy, let me tell you.  It has been a blast to drive, even though in central Illinois the roads are pretty straight and flat.  The clutch take-up is p-e-r-f-e-c-t and the shifter is smooth and creamy - the nicest and easiest manual I think I've ever driven.  I think the Italian design is attractive/cute and this thing zips in and out of traffic lanes and parking spots with ease.  I have yet to reach it's handling limits, but will tell you they're very high.  This is like a reliable version of the Mini (which has pathetic reliability and costs much, much more).  The only things with which I take issue on the car are the sun visors that don't tilt forward enough and block my view (and let sunlight in on the sides) and poor AM radio reception.  That, and parts being a little tougher to find since Suzuki (cars) left the country.  Still plenty of parts available if you search hard enough, though - and oil filters, air filters, plugs etc are pretty standard sizes so super easy to find.  Oh, and insurance is a bit high - higher than my wife's '14 Honda CR-V, for some reason.  MPG has been good for me - about 31 mixed 60/40 hwy/city.  Plenty of front seat room - I'm 6' tall and 230 lbs and don't feel the least bit crowded - plenty of fore/aft and up/down adjustment.  Rear seat room does look tight on legroom, though - so it's probably best for short trips for adults or for mini-me's.  After doing my research, the only problem areas on these seem to be an errant airbag light (covered under recall), and the A/C compressor clutch.  Most genuine Suzuki's are bulletproof (not the Suzuki-named Daewoo models like Verona, Forenza, etc. though).   Anyway, this is my commuter and I'm getting to work with a big grin on my face (not that I'm happy to be at work) and looking forward to my next drive - it's seriously THAT fun.

suzuki,sx4,2010,tishpit1, 11/02/2013,"Overall a nice, fun, 4WD SUV",4,"My father and I co-own this car, bought new, to handle the treacherous roads of Pittsburgh in the winter.
It handles very sporty, good tire grip, great in turns.
Mileage was a dismal 16 MPG in Pa., but since moving to Florida, now getting 27.6 MPG, but all level driving.
Feels roomy up front, tight in rear, and more cargo room than a sedan, but not as good as it could be (fold flat rear seat needed!).
Peppy around town and on highway, CVT does a good job.
Interior is rather bland and radio quality is poor.
But my biggest gripe is regarding the front ""A"" pillars... causes DANGEROUS blind spots.
Poor design on that, and must lean forward and back to see around them.
Seats are hard too."

The car does not leak when I drove it through the car wash. Do I recommend it? Yes! The price is the point of sale for this car.  So go for it, the car is peppy and a good starter and commuter car.

suzuki,sx4,2010,talledega66, 10/03/2010,Superb Suzuki aka Fiat,4,"The car has been simple to own, the maintenance schedule is easy with the timing chain instead of belt ( as seen on more expensive cars), the oil changes every 7500 miles, with a special we got free a maintenance package. Suspension is better than any other comparably priced compact sedan, even better than one I drove costing almost 10k more. It feels heavier really secure at all speeds, corners well. Overall the 150 hp engine is enough with manual 6 speed (I test drove automatic and it was also adequate), but not as much fun. The car gets attention, people always like the styling. For a small car there's a lot of head and leg room even in back, overall it was the best choice"

Its very comfortable and interior/exterior fit, finish and style are top notch and it doesn't look for feel cheap like the other compact sedans I considered buying.

suzuki,sx4,2010,rothparker80, 10/15/2010,Completely surprised,5,"It was a fluke that we happened upon this car. In the market for a new VW Golf originally. On the way to pick up the Golf, we passed by Suzuki, the SX4 caught our eye,we stopped in for a last minute look. The styling, wheels and features had us nearly sold on it before driving it. Once we drove it, that sealed the deal. It was way more sophisticated than a Honda, Toyota etc. and was much funner to drive than the Golf, not to mention $6K cheaper, better warranty and more features. I do agree with the other reviews in that it could use leather, sunroof and heated seats, like you can get on Corollas,but Suzuki had to leave some room for improvement I suppose."

The next day, we went and test drove one.  We love the spacious interior, excellent gps, cruise control, power everything, and the beautiful copper color.  Selectable All wheel drive is a bonus, as is the CVT transmission with manual shifting ability.  The Crossover rides smoothly, but tends to have some body lean and sometimes spongy feel.  The engine is powerful, but only above 3,000 RPM.  Overall, good car"

At first it feels large but once you put 4 adults in you realize how small it really is.

We bought this car because we had a baby on the way.
The trunk barely fits the baby stroller and the passenger seat has to be moved all the way forward to accommodate the baby seat.

This car gets very poor MPG, isn't fun to drive, and isn't very large.
The only real redeeming feature I can think of is the AWD which is pretty capable even in very nasty weather.
It's not a bad car, it's just very mediocre but it doesn't cost much money. "

We were looking for a an SUV or minivan for her, but she saw it and said, ""this one's cute."" The price is also right for a new car. The dealer was very good and positive. We were also surprised with the $300 gas card! If you're looking for a nice small vehicle, definitely check it out. There is one caveat however. I am 5'9"" and I can't find a comfortable driving position. This is meant for shorter drivers."

Though its a naturally aspirated four cylinder, it has a lot of low end torque and the manual six speed uses the power well. It keeps right up with more powerful engines, the 150 horsepower is plenty. It handles way better than the other comparable vehicles I considered, and feels more solid and safe. The only things I think would make it better would be the option of a sunroof and leather. I had those installed, so for me I couldn't ask for more! The styling is also top notch, designed in Italy, it gets a lot of compliments."

I usually get 31-32 mpg commuting using E10 fuel but a little better now with the AC off.
I got a high of 35.7 on an interstate trip with ethanol-free fuel. I have the base model with nothing that I don't want. The base model lacks cruise control and I am fine with that.

This car handles well, is fun to drive, and has a smooth quiet ride.I am currently averaging about 26.5 MPG combined city and highway. One of the biggest complaints that I consistently read about from other owners was the quality of the radio. Initially, I agreed but later found that the radio bass and treble controls were set to zero. Once that was corrected the sound quality was much improved. I love my Suzuki!"

I can also, unfortunately, attest to the unbelievable safety of this car. I got in a head-on crash at about 50 mph with a large Infiniti. all the doors still opened after the crash, and the only injury i sustained was a small burn on my arm from the airbag opening and rubbing against it.

It is a very slow car to get up to speed so you have to stomp the gas pedal, so if you plan on highway driving not a good choice.

The next time I drove the car and used the air conditioner the antifreeze smell was there again.

This car is heavy, solid, and handles great when driving around twisty back roads.
Suzuki is biased towards building great handling cars rather then simply ones that accelerate fast.
The SX4 Crossover is NOT an economy car.
It easily weighs over 3000 with a driver and full tank of fuel.
 This is a vehicle that tries to do everything well and succeeds.
Some cars just do one thing well, like a Prius getting great mileage or a Wrangler being good in the middle of the woods.

What we discovered was we already owned the vehicle we were shopping for.
No other compact car available in Canada has AWD and 4x4 option.
The biggest complaint I have, even though I'm petite and fit the car wonderfully, is the seats are uncomfortable. I struggle to drive or even be a passenger for longer than 20 minutes. 
Also the climate control... 😞 ohhh the climate control... let me just say... it leaves much much much to be desired. I have owned it since it was 3 years old, and it's performed poorly since day 1.
Oh and oil changes.... whoever decided to put the oil filter in that spot... should perhaps consider a new department to work in.
But we've had no problems with mechanical, leaky rear differential seal.. and just regular maintenance. 
It is kinda gutless, but it's 4 cylinders, and the manual shift option is great for passing.

Owners of these vehicles knows these secrets. The only mistake that Suzuki did is the creation of the Grand Vitara creating a 6 cylinder. Grand Vitara's fuel consumption rating is not good. They should kept the 4 cylinder Vitara version.
Numerous people are now seeking to own used Samurai, Sidekick and Tracker; its high value price hold. I had a car repair business for 9 yrs. and only one (1) Suzuki that I encountered broken is because the young teenager never had an oil change. Engine Froze."
suzuki,sx4,2013,GotSuzuki, 01/30/2018,Best small AWD evah!!,5,"I was devastated when Suzuki shut down in America... I have been looking at the SX4 as the previous year but postpone buying one. When I had constant breakdowns on a Jeep Cherokee with less than 30,000 miles on it, I sold Cherokee and drove across state lines to buy a silver SX4 with 5000 mi. That was 5 years ago. I've had zero problems, this liitle car handles great in snow, has awesome space, looks great.. I get tons of compliments in fact I get people leaving cards on it asking if I'm selling it. I hope to have it for years to come

I had the choice between this and a 2012 accord, and I chose this. I'm super happy with my decision. This is an awd with excellent gas mileage and lots of ground clearance. I hope the sx4 turns out to be as awesome as my Elantra was. Update 2016: 89,000 miles and no repairs besides oil, brakes, tires. Excellent car

suzuki,sx4,2013,Kathy, 10/05/2018,Who needs a key,4,"This car can be started with or without the key in the ignition.  Cannot find a local dealer to work on car.  Even though I was told Dwayne Lane would continue to work on Suzuki's they claim all the trained service people have left the company.  I contacted the dealer I bought the car from and they gave me instructions for an automatic transmission when this car has a manual transmission.  I really prefer the dash board features on the 2008 SX4 as opposed to the 2013.  I love the visibility with this model.  I also like how you can step out of the car instead of crawling out.  This model is the perfect size for my family.  All new cars are too big for me.

Then the Suzuki people decided they would not honor the warrantee.  Claiming the oil had not been changed.  The receipts had all burned in a mobile home our workers lived in and they had been driving the car.  We have a very useless Suzuki and do not recommend any buy one.

suzuki,verona,2004,Juan, 05/11/2008,Guess it's still a Daewoo,3,"I purchased the Verona back in 2004 brand new and I was ecstatic. It looked great, rode well, and was incredibly smooth. I was always complimented on how good-looking the car was and how nice the interior appeared. And even now I still like the Verona, it's just the reliability that is complete crap. I've had issues with the 02 sensors, bearings, and now the engine has problems with the fuel injectors. At about 11,000 miles the whole transmission had to be replaced and it's now beginning to act up again. The car isn't worth the headache. And it's a shame because Suzuki could've had a hit."
suzuki,verona,2004,geneo, 07/26/2010,The Beast with Faults,4,"The Engine will pass most anything in and out of its class [I used to own an  audi turbo] at the front end it has a hesitation.  The suspension is too soft and will need to be replaced too soon [100k]. The electrical/indicator system is not the best[my check engine light has been on and off for over 100k and my millage has not changed since day one, and the dealers cannot give me a ration explanation. Car has 150k miles and stops on a dime and has bailed me out of several nasty braking situations!"

I had the engine replaced and on my third transmission.  The other day while parked with a child in the car it was destroyed by a engine fire .  We were lucky no one got hurt and when I went to Suzuki for help they told me too bad.  I am telling you this car was a joke and they do not stand behind it if it catches on fire.  They spent more on warranty work than what the car was worth.  They should have negotiated with me after the engine and second transmission.  Make sure you carry hazard insurance...."

However, I have had this car for half of a year and have spent over $1,000 replacing and fixing parts that my dealer should have himself. The sunroof and heated leather are quite nice, but this car is noisy and is in no way a smooth ride. I was generous with the review I left, and I am in a hurry to get myself out of this vehicle and situation. It may just be the very unreliable and deceitful dealer I purchased this from (Autoworld of Conway, SC)."

suzuki,verona,2004,Stan Smith, 12/30/2007,2004 Suzuki Verona EX,4,I'm pretty pleased with the Suzuki Verona.  I've read the other reviews and I haven't had the same number of problems as some of the reviewers.  I have only had two problems.  The first is that in the city and on the highway I only seem to get 19mpg.  The second problem that I've had is the car occasionally stalling out at red lights.  That's the reason that I decided to post a review.  I took the car into the dealership and they told me that they couldn't reproduce the problem but it happend again on the way home.  The good news is that I put STP Gas Treatment in the car the next time I filled up and the problem hasn't recurred in 3 months.  I suspect it was bad gas or a dirty injector.
suzuki,verona,2004,jay, 03/22/2007,Beware! Lots of mechanical defects,2,"A year of ownership this car has major problems. It's been in the shop every month since then with repair bills ranging from $250-600 a shot. This car has had 2 engines, a transmission, suspension, wheel bearings, countless computer reprogrammings ($60 each), axle comes loose about every 6 months (makes a grinding/thumping noise upon acceleration); that's just in the time i've owned it. It's past it's 36k warranty so the only thing that has been covered is the engine and tranny. I baby this thing as i have done with all my cars. Now not out of love but out of fear of it breaking! My thoughts: Don't ever buy this car! If you have one I suggest dumping it fast! Take the equity hit it's cheaper"
suzuki,verona,2004,Caryl, 04/29/2007,Disappointed,2,"The Verona seemed like a great buy, almost luxurious with the leather, heated seats but in 2 short years I am now waiting for a buyback on it. In January (this is April)the engine and transmission were replaced; it is now sitting because of the same major problems and no doubt needs a new engine again. The transmission is erratic and also clunks into gear. The engine leaks oil into places they can not fix - such as the pistons.  I didn't have the heart to even trade it in for another car, I didn't want someone else to be stuck with it. My suggestion - don't buy one!!"
suzuki,verona,2004,junit483, 09/05/2007,Don't buy it,1,"I purchased this vehicle after I had my first child. Two weeks after purchase it had to go into the dealership for repair. The rearend came loose. That repair took three days to complete. The next problem was some wierd eletrical disturbnce. The radio would come on and select a volume on its own. Not exactly an easy way to keep an infant asleep. That repair took almost a full week to diagnose and fix. After that the transmission went, Engine blow (note: no oil was missing and after they checked the computer it wasn't abused) no explaination was given to why it went. Between the tranny and engine going the car was in for repairs for over a month and a half. The dealership did get me a rental."

Considering the motor, the suspension and the lack of speed. it was not nice enough to keep and deal with. It would be nice though, if Suzuki can fix the problems on the Veronas, they are very nice.

I have read that the engine was not designed to run on fuel that has an ethanol content. My Verona has been in the shop six times and the engine is still not right. Suzuki does not stand by this great Warranty they claim to have. I have also read that a lot of Verona owners have had Suzuki buy back their Verona, why would Suzuki do that unless they know the car is junk. I am trying to make the same thing happen. Its a battle. Good-luck."

My check engine light has been on the entire time that I had the car. The dealerships know that this car is a lemon and they will try not to fix anything on the car.

Smooth, responsive, comfortable, and the clear equal to Accord and Camry for the price of a Civic (if not cheaper).  Here's the thing.  Most reviewers assume that you want a 4-cyl for fuel economy and a 6-cyl for power, so they knock the Verona for not being either one.  But Suzuki chose a 6-cyl that was as small as the average 4-cyl on purpose: smoothness and even power.  It cruises over Rocky Mountain passes at 75 mph without straining at all.  I'll probably spend only $1000 more in gas over the 5 years I'll own it, but I saved $4-5k on the sticker price similarly-equipped Accord or Camry.  It looks better, too.

suzuki,verona,2004,Carsel, 01/16/2004,Class Value.,4,"Just a test drive will confirm what 
others have been saying. The car rides 
very smooth in normal driving 
conditions. The interior looks upscale

The best thing is the price and 
features compressed into the car. On 
highways and hills the car rides very 
well. The inner space is large and 
easily sits five.Trunk space is good."

Kia or hundai, definetly more then the 
US models. I know you get what you pay 
for but just the simple details and 
qaulity I was incredibly surprised. 
Great Job, If Suzuki keeps this up 
they'll  have a great reputation too 
and me buying another one.  "

done its homework with a mid size 
option that does'nt cost the earth but 
has lots of features with no extra 
cost. The Verona surprised all with 
its roominess and neatly laid out 
controls on the dash. The Car's inline 
rides ever so smooth that you'll 
wonder if its moving. The power on the 
car is OK but it does feel torquey. 
The design looks euro and unique and 
is generally liked by all. A very good 
option that you must test ride."
suzuki,verona,2004,DRS, 01/24/2006,A Very Nice Ride,4,"I have owned over two dozen cars. The Suzuki Verona is a better all around car than most of my previous vehicles. First of all, I have only driven my Verona a few thousand miles, so I cannot comment on long term reliability. That being said, I have had not had to take it to a dealer yet. The 155HP V6 engine does not produce a fast car per say, however it is very smooth and quiet due to its inline design. I still can honestly say it is quicker than the Ford Taurus base V6, and much quieter to boot. This is a family sedan, not a sports car. I love both the unique interior and exterior design. Besides, I paid thousands under sticker price, and the inclusion of a 100,000 mile Suzuki warranty sealed the deal."

The first was a world car bought over seas, the second was a 1994 Swift which has close to 200,000 miles on it and my son still drives it, and now I have the Verona. The Verona is very comfortable in front and back.  It has plenty of leg room for everyone, This car is so comfortable that my elderly mother would rather ride with me than any of my other siblings."

drove the Altima, Mazda M3 and M6 and a 
2003 BMW 530 with 39000 miles and full

ride very nice. I could not find in 
these cars, except for the BMW 530, a

suzuki,verona,2004,Columbus OH owner, 03/25/2006,Big bang for my buck,4,"My 2004 Verona has been my favorite car purchase in over 30 years. I really enjoy this car. It is thrifty and money wise, this car out shines any other midsize sedan for its features, comfort and style.  I have the all leather interior and always get a ""wow, nice car"", when folks get in. I have had no problems mechanically and am very satisfied with this heavily optioned but lower priced car.  I had one small front end collision, which was a bit of an issue. A replacement hood was not readily avaliable, it had to come from Korea. The shop time was a whopping four weeks. After the first year of ownership, my gas mileage fell and I found that a sensor had gone bad. Once it was repaired the mileage returned to normal, aproximately 20-24 mpg."
suzuki,verona,2004,PeggySNew, 03/02/2004,Bought it Love it,5,"I love my new car.  The features of the 
car make it a great buy.  I got leather

power sunroof, and many more for less 
then what it would cost on a Toyota 
Camry, and my car seems bigger."
suzuki,verona,2004,marvinlee, 03/05/2004,Suzuki Verona EX,3,"The Verona is a precision built, 
attractive car with low power and only 
fair fuel economy given its six 
cylinder engine with dual overhead 
cams.  The overall fit and finish rival 
much more costly cars.  Notable is the 
light effort to open the trunk lid, the 
beautiful instruments (LS and EX 
models) and automatic temperature 
control (LS and EX).  Unlike any other 
new car I have owned, the Verona has 
not required any return trips to the 
dealer for minor factory assembly 
problems.  The body is quiet on good 
roads but transmits excessive tire 
noise on rough concrete and asphalt."
suzuki,verona,2004,pAUL bRAUTIGAM, 04/22/2006,My Verona,5,My wife and I have enjoyed this vehicle very much.  The interior and exterior styling is classy.

suzuki,verona,2004,eddie c. pollard, 05/06/2006,2004 Suzuki Verona,2,"The car has been in the shop quite a bit as a result of a stalling / hesitation problem with the engine.  Also, the cruise control has quit working and has been replaced once and will need to be replaced again.  The cruise control is a mechanical unit that sometimes surges significantly once set and poses a safety problem."
suzuki,verona,2004,Louienj1, 03/12/2004,Where are they hiding the x-tra 2 cyls ?,3,"To sit in this car is the best dollar 
for dollar lux-o-like sedans. Hit the 
road and you CAN NOT believe this car 
is 6 cyl. I drove many cars under 25k, 
none of the others 
had less power. Understand that true 
driving power is derived by the engine 
output vs. the car's weight. This car 
is ""an attractive cow with the heart of 
a hamster"".
I really liked the interior of the car. 
Suzuki should use the XL-7 V6 engine, 
even if it adds $1-$2G's to the price.
If you really do want this car, wait. 
By 2005 they will offer a more powerful 
version. So buy a more powerful V6 or 
save on the 2004 models left or buy 
used (because the warranty transfers)."
suzuki,verona,2004,Slippers, 05/20/2006,Cheap Luxury,4,"I bought this car used for my daughter and we both love it. It does not have the best acceleration but it will get you there in comfort. If you love bells and whistles and don't want to spend a lot of money, this car is it. I do find the trunk space a little small. This may not be the car for the constant traveler but for local and short trips, I could find nothing in this price range with all the options I wanted. I drove the car a week before I surprised her with it and I hated to turn it over. I am now in the market for a 2006. This car feels like a high dollar luxury vehicle minus the power. The size is perfect, not too big and not too small. Its brakes feel spongy, but stops on a dime."

rich looking. I love all the little 
extra storage spaces and especially the

it seems to be improving. We only

Hondas, Nissans, Kias, Hyundais, and 
all the american offerings and could 
not find a better car for the money. 
Though not as peppy as others, the

get more bang for your buck. We have 
the EX with all the bells and whistles

suzuki,verona,2004,DOCMITZ, 05/08/2004,Very Impressed...,4," Traded 130K Nissan Maxima. I was 
concerned trading down in horsepower 
from 255 to 177.
Then the thought of saving $12K on 
new Maxima made me turn the corner.
I could not be more impressed. I drove 
both and while there is quite a 
difference in get up and go, the Verona 
drove so much smoother and quieter. 
Only concern in the back of my mind is 
Fuzzy Technology Transmission. Needs to 
get to know  me and I need to get to 
know it. Seems the thing has a brain 
that reacts to its drivers tendancies. 
Only time will tell if the savings and 
value are there, but with a seven year 
100,000 mile warranty, no worries and 
the price is outstanding for a fully 
loaded model."
suzuki,verona,2004,TexasJay, 05/19/2004,underestimated car,4,"Just bought the Verona. I think the 
engineers copied a 2002 Maxima, which 
isn't a bad thing. It's very 
comfortable and drives extremely well. 
A little better acceloration would be 
nice, but I don't care if it's a 
second or two behind the new Altimas 
or Accords. The build quality appears 
to be no different than Honda, Toyota, 
or Nissan. My first new car was a 1987 
Samurai that went eight years and 
120,000+ miles without a problem. 
Performance is nice, but my main 
concern is quality and I like this 
one. "

how much I was going to like this car.  
I traded in a Maxima for the Verona, 
and I feel like I traded up!  What a 
surpise.  It has more amenities and 
features than my Maxima and it has a 
much more comfortable ride.  It's tight 
and quite.  I have yet to see another 
Verona here on the east side of 
Jackonville.  They don't appear to have 
caught on here yet.  That's okay...I've 
got a ride that's unique and that I

Suzuki. I liked the style and all the 
options that came on the Suzuki as 
standard epuipment---it was loaded. Two 
things that I don't like is the gas 
mileage and the poor get up and go---
once it hits 20-30 mph its pretty 
peppy. I wish I had researched it on 
the internet before I bought---seeing 
how it is a rehashed Dae Woo---I might 
still have bought it, but I would have 
thought about it for a while. All in 
all, it is a lot of car for the money

4000 rpm.  In-line six is noted for its

recommend this car to anyone looking

new computer chip corrects it, and 
flickering or the outside temp

on continuously. The car started to 
tick while the light was on and the car 
sounded like a tractor. I took it to be 
serviced on July 19, 2004 and it is 
still there. They told me it was the 
oil pump, oil gauge, and then they 
relaced the motor. Now they are saying 
it is idling high. I think they need to 
replace my car. It has been a month and 
a half since I have driven my car. "

is that the engine is realy smooth like 
driving with an electric motor. One you 
have experienced the smoothness of the 
motor you won't want to go back to a V

weak on power, but once the engine 
broke in the power was acceptable.  I 
realy wanted all the options but wanted 
the best bang for the buck and I 
believe I got it with the Verona 
instead of a Honda, or Toyota.  We got 
our Verona with 1500 Dollar Factory

shafted by the engine's computer which

a very loud tapping noise along with the

It is roomy and stylish. I love the radio controls on the steering wheel and the full size spare.   Unfortunately I have had to take the car in quite a bit. Since it is a new model, they have to get the kinks out.   It is a little discouraging but the dealership is trying their best to fix the problems. "

The sun roof is a nice feature but it's noisy on the highway when the shield is open but the sun roof is closed. There is a big blind spot between the side windows & the front windshield. The gas mileage could use a little help & it has only one useable cupholder. Other drivers sometimes think I have my brights on when I don't. Tuxedo Black paint with matching spoiler makes the car look really nice. Great value for the look & feel of a luxury vehicle."

It comes with lots of options all thrown in for what you would have to pay thousands extra if you went with a Toyota Camry (which was my other choice).  Too bad the performance of this is plagued with computer glitches and transmission issues.  This being the first model year has had its problems.  I just got mine out of the shop for the third time.  This time the ECM (Electronic Control Module) had to be reprogrammed.  As of Aug, '06, it seems better now, but I'm almost afraid to drive it.  It has stalled twice while approaching stop lights.  If I get any more major problems, I will seriously be thinking about dumping (uh - trading) it."

In fact, the ride was quite nice and enjoyable."

At 38,000 miles the top of the engine block needed to be rebuilt.  There have also been some other small problems as well.  The dealership has been excellent in working with me to limit my inconvenience.  All that being said, this car is not a Honda or Toyota yet.

I have had to drive it with gas and the brakes at the same time in order for it not to turn off. I have taken to dealer to have fix three times and just yesterday the light came on again.  According to the dealer the first time was a blown fuse, the second time was a computer, and the third time the motor went out, and I wonder what they will tell me this time. I am at 35,300 miles on it. I got this car on 10/05 with 25,372 miles on it.  Also, it makes a popping sound when steering from side to side, like the old cars do.

But this past January, I had to have to the transmission completely replaced. I've also had my doubts about the axles and CV joints, though the dealer hasn't found anything wrong. The ""check engine"" light has come on a couple times over false alarms and I've noticed that the transmission can be quite sticky when switching out of/into reverse gear. I also have some concerns about whether the Verona could've been designed with better fuel efficiency. Lastly, I've abandoned using the wheel-mounted stereo controls; they don't respond accurately at all."

It's an 05 we bought in 07. Shortly after purchasing the back bumper was hit in a parking lot. Instead of only bending the bumper, a 2 1/2 ft. long piece of paint peeled off and fell. The check engine light comes on frequently & took it to the shop the first couple of times, to find out that ""nothing was wrong"". It still comes on and goes off all the time.
A month ago it started jerking while driving, at random times.
Sometimes within 5 mins, sometimes we drive all day before it happens, sometimes it won't at all. Now the key won't turn in the ignition 75% of time. After trying several times it finally will. Is this happening to anyone else???"

Its only been back to the dealership for scheduled maintenances and once because the transmission had to be replaced. The car used to spuck and skit all over the place until the transmission was replaced at 3,000 miles at no extra cost. Now it runs like a gem. It has a smooth, quiet, relaxing ride, with a fairly responsive inline-6. The interior has high quality materials with a pretty decent 6-speaker audio.

I have spent cummulative weeks at the nearest Suzuki dealership, having oxy-sensors replaced, the ECU reprogrammed multiple times, the ignition lock, the wheel lock, and many, many smaller random sensors replaced.

we have to drive an hour each way for chemo every week. I have to drive with one foot on the gas and one on the brake. This car's a death trap."

suzuki,verona,2005,nace818, 02/15/2005,MY VERONA,4,"My Verona has 9000 trouble-free miles on it. I really do love this car. I have read alot of negative comments about the car, but none of them seem to apply, at least not to mine. I think the design is great both interior and exterior. I'm really surprised I don't see more of them on the road. It's alot of car for the money. If Suzuki would do more advertising for it, I think it would be a better seller. My advice would be buy one and you will enjoy it. "
suzuki,verona,2005,Jeff, 02/27/2005,Verona,4,Nice handling car with lots of extras for the price. Dealership made me a great deal and stuck with it the whole time. I felt taken care of by them and by my sporty new car.

Once I saw the car's exterior, I knew I just had to take it for a test drive. It drives very smoothly. It feels like you are riding on air! The interior of the car is the best I've seen in midsize cars. It has many safety features to accomodate children and the child at heart. I have been so pleased with my Verona I tell all my friends to test drive one for an experience of a lifetime. I would buy another Suzuki in a heartbeat!!!"

suzuki,verona,2005,shantel, 06/02/2005,Great car for the cost,4,"We were in the market looking for a newer car, not the gas hog like our Suburban. I saw the Verona and immediately liked the appearance.  We own a Forenza, which has been no problem, so we thought another Suzuki would work out fine.   We were impressed with how it drove, the feel and comfort levels inside of the car, and for parents of 2 small children, it was imperative to have space in the trunk to carry strollers, etc.  The Verona has lots of basic needs, that cost extra on other comparable cars.  We liked that we could get a new car for under $16K, that had everything we needed.  We went for the basic model, no bells and whistles, but Suzuki doesn't skimp on the basic necessities."
suzuki,verona,2005,verona buyer, 06/24/2005,Verona experience,4,"This vehicle is better than all the reviews I have read about. The handling does not seem sloppy and my car has side impact bags in the front seats. I love the interior, especially the casette player and the audio controls on the steering wheel. The headroom is good and the seats are comfortable. I like this car. Those are the pluses, now for the minuses. The windshield wipers don't seem to have a fast speed and the headlights are weak.        "
suzuki,verona,2005,jack26, 08/15/2005,"Lots of car, little money",4,"The Verona really surprised me. I didn't expect the vehicle to be this good. It's quiet, smooth, and kind of fun to drive. The sound from the inline-6 brings a grin to my face everytime I give it a whip. Quality of the materials are great and the woodgrain trim almost looks real. Interior comfort, front and rear, is excellent, and the front seats hold you in nicely when going around swift bends. The ride is really relaxing and you can hardly hear the road or any wind noise even when traveling above 60 mph. The Verona is a great total package and is perfect for bargain hunters like myself. "
suzuki,verona,2005,Rik, 10/29/2005,Not what I Expect,2,"With just 3,400 miles on it, the ""air bag"" light indicator in my 2005 Suzuki Verona came on while I was driving. I took it to the dealer where I bought it and I was told they're too busy. I stressed to the technician / mechanic if he understand the consequences that may arise if something happens. The techs response is: ""oh nothing will happen"". I told this guy: ""are you going to compensate my kids if something happens?"" I asked for his manager and the owner of the dealership, and guess what: of course the response is: ""they're not in.""  Now, I'm still driving the car with the airbag indicator lights on the dashboard and just waiting for what will happen. Hopefully Suzuki and the dealer will pay for it if something happens."
suzuki,verona,2005,Trevon M., 12/12/2005,You Can't Go Wrong With This Car!,4,"My fiancee and I were looking for a new car and were actually were looking at a Kia Optima. But once he offered to let us test drive a 2005 Suzuki Verona, we both were drawn to it because of its design and features. It shares its lines with Toyota Camry, but is indeed a Suzuki! I was impressed with the woodgrain accents, as well as the placement of the easy to use controls in the car's interior, but was even MORE impressed with the car's handling during the test drive. It has plenty of power and a very smooth and quiet ride. The keyless entry and trunk release built into the key itself are also a plus. This is a must have ride! This comes from a die hard GM owner, who's just been turned to imports!"
suzuki,verona,2005,KenGTS, 12/14/2005,A Lot of Car for Less Money,4,"I walked into the dealership not knowing a darn thing about these cars and then left with one. Mine is a demo the dealership owner was driving. I couldn't believe how smooth it is. The inline six engine is very smooth, but needs some more oomf. I can't wait for the summer road trip!"
suzuki,verona,2005,Mike Smith, 07/11/2006,Not what you'd think!,2,"My 2005 Verona was a fun car to drive and it ran very well. Until I had a ""Thud"" in the transmission and it went down hill from there. After a ""Reprogramming"", it now hesitates very frequently, it has a lot less horsepower, and gas milage is rotten and those were this car's good points! Suzuki has given me the run-around between Cal (Where you have to call for problems) and a service rep that takes days to call you back. If you want a car for a reasonable price, my experience is this car is ""Not what you'd think!"""

proves it"
suzuki,verona,2005,Nadine, 12/30/2004,"Lots of features, very stylish",4,"I did research on the 2005 Suzuki Verona before I 
purchased it. Several sites stated that 
it was poor on crash tests. Despite 
this concern, the Verona is a great 
car. The interior is excellent! Heated 
saets, moon roof, 6 speaker sound 
sustem with tape and CD capabilities, 
power driver's seat. and power windows 
and locks, what more could you ask for? 
The ride was a little stiff at first, 
but has improved greatly. It is a 
smooth, comfortable ride. Don't try to 
make any quick manuvers in it, as it is 
slow to respond sometimes. But it does 
have a smooth ride and acceleration 
when you need to pick up speed to pass. 
Despite my concerns during an accident 
(received a poor rating on side impact) 
I love it!"

great.  Also, this car has great handling.

suzuki,verona,2005,joe spear, 01/28/2005,verona,4,Since purchased this verona has been an excellent ride.  Its quiet and comfortable.  The lumbar seats are great for my bad back. I have the titanium silver color which is easy to keep clean.  It doesnt show dirt too much as compared with red or black.  I would purchase another one with no second thoughts..
suzuki,verona,2005,Glenn, 05/20/2005,Buyer Beware,2,"The seats are as hard as a rock and uncomfortable.  Very slow acceleration.  Very sloppy steering with serious under-steer. I rented this car for a few days and was very unimpressed...but its a Suzuki, which is enough said. I'd buy the low-end Accord or Camry before this vehicle.  No side airbags. A knowledgeable car person wouldn't ever consider this car. I can only imagine the low resale value this car will have in a couple of years    "
suzuki,verona,2005,Jim Rutledge, 05/22/2005,Great Value,4,"I looked long and hard to find a car that would give me room, economy, and style and I found it in the Verona. It has more room than Camry and priced thousands less. It also comes standard with a V-6."
suzuki,verona,2005,dvelata, 06/17/2005,My Verona,4,"I love this car. I bought the Verona after owning a Nissan Altima (which I loved) for 6 years. The number of features you can get for the low price is astounding. Mine's fully loaded, and an absolute dream to drive. There's lots of leg room and the auto driver's seat is great. It also gets pretty decent gas mileage for a V-6 - I get 30 even driving around in the mountains. Bottom line: If you want a great car with lots of features but without totally emptying your wallet, the Verona is great. The 100,000 mile warranty is awesome too, even though I hardly ever use it!"

suzuki,verona,2005,DaveD, 09/05/2005,2005 Suzuki Verona EX,2,"My 2005 Suzuki Verona EX is my second Suzuki. I have experienced the same problems in both my previous Forenza now this 2004 Verona.  They seem to want to hide the fact that the tachometer surges.  I've stalled at the least safe times in BOTH makes, getting onto freeways or trying to pass.  You will love the warranty until you try to USE it and then try to get a ""loaner"" when they keep it over night.  You will be stuck.  this is my last Suzuki purchase ever, it's a cheap car, and mom always said, ""you get what you pay for"", listen to your mother."
suzuki,verona,2005,Andy Cloutier, 05/03/2006,My Verona I love you but.,4,"We liked what we saw, the style was very attractive, The 20"" wheels look real racy and it has disc brakes all around, wow.  I like the ABS and air pressure check from the dash.  The 6 cylinder engine is very smooth. The pneumatic hood lifters are a plus, no need to raise the hood bar. The automatic shifter very smooth. The interior wood applique and chrome trim very are attractive.  The leather intrerior, heated seats and heated outdoor mirrors are a luxury you wouldn't expect from a car this price. BUT, its gas mileage is not impressive.  I am only getting 15 MPG on average.  My car wobbles too much on windy days and the transmission is a little clunky when shifting,  It is not a perfect world,  we love it and we would give it a B+  all in all, the Verona is a nice city car."
suzuki,verona,2005,Alienpath, 08/15/2006,"Verona, Not Bad.",4,"The Verona's ride is probably one of its best features.  In my opinion, it blows the Accord away in comfort.  Its design is maybe a bit old school, but very nice and classy.  Its engine is smooth running and rather quiet, until you step on it.  There's a lot of bang for the buck with the Verona Luxury model.  It's only unknown is its reliability, which remains to be seen."
suzuki,verona,2005,deedals, 10/28/2006,This Car Stinks,2,I purchased my Verona  on 1/31/05.  I had to go back to the dealer because the engine light kept coming on.  The engine was eventually replaced.  When I put the car in gear and pressed the accelerator it hesitated before it actually moved with jerking motions.  It went back to the dealer again and I have been going back time and time again with no solution.  I'm told the car is operating as it is should.  If this car is operating as it should it is a piece of junk.  I would never buy a Suzuki again or recommend anyone to do so.  By the way I called the manufacturer in California and the response was as great as the car's performance.
suzuki,verona,2005,Stupid Steph, 12/30/2006,Verona Vomit,2,"I have owned this car for approximately fifteen months in which time I have experienced a rear brake fluid leak that caused them to go all the way to the floor.   Now that I am want to get a different car, no one will give me much for it because they say that the word is ""the transmissions are no good."" I myself have experienced it stalling and shifting in and out while driving down the highway."
suzuki,verona,2005,Big Mel, 03/14/2008,No More Suzy Qs 4-Me,4,"Personally, I like the automobile as a whole. It's fun to drive and has a lot of drive appeal.  The only set back I truly have is trying to find parts (since I am somewhat a ""do-it-yourselfer""); and even at best it seems to be difficult for auto shops to find the necessary parts (like air filters). Other than that it's a great car, fun to drive and all in all I haven't had any serious problems out of this car. I'll say on a scale from one to ten I'll give it an eight."
suzuki,verona,2006,goodfrench229, 02/25/2006,Terrible Car,1,"My 2006 Suzuki Verona is a terrible car.  Its heater would not work.  I had a broken temperature control cable.  Its paint was bubbled up.  All four doors and quarter panel had to be repainted.  The speedometer needle fell off (no kidding,it fell completely off and was sitting in the bottom of the gauge housing).  My car has been stalling during sharp acceleration.  This is very dangerous, it would stall and almost die.  As you can imagine, this is not much fun when pulling into traffic.  The dealer could not do anything to repair this problem.  It must be a characteristic of this car.  It has done it since it was new. It is hard to start when it is cold outside.  The dealer I bought the car from quit dealing with Suzuki.  My new dealer is one and a half hours away and he told me if it was running they could do nothing."
suzuki,verona,2006,Suki, 05/14/2006,Diamond in the Rough,5,"Suzuki is on to something with the Verona and Camry and Accord better take notice!  This car really impressed me, the acceleration may be a bit slow off the line, but who's looking to race...not me, my kids are riding with me.  I fell in love with this car and am looking to enjoy if for many years to come.  Suzuki keep the innovations and power coming, and you will see this car soar!"

suzuki,verona,2006,VClue, 10/20/2005,I love my Verona,4,"I purchased a Suzuki Verona because it appeared to give me the most options for my money.  I have totally enjoyed my car.  No, it doesn't have a lot of pick up for a cold start but, once it gets going, it has no problems keeping up with the crowd.  It has a smooth quiet ride. The steering is easy to handle.  The interior options are a plus.  I feel truly blessed to have this car. Unfortunately, my daughter recently had an accident in my car, and the police said, it must be built pretty well because it should have been a lot more messed up from that impact.  She's doing fine and the car is back on the road to enjoy.                                         "
suzuki,verona,2006,Phil, 07/06/2006,A Great Value,4,"After looking at all midsized models, I couldn't find another that offered as much for the price.  Now, after 15,000 miles, it still runs great and the engine is very quiet on the road because of the 6-cylinder engine.  It does not have lots of power, it's but sufficient.  I've been getting about 27- 28 mpg on the road.  My Verona has no problems at this time and I still think it is one of the better looking vehicles on the road.  It has good legroom in backseat."
suzuki,verona,2006,M Covich - Tampa, FL,Verona - A good car for the money,3,So far I'm pleased with my new Verona -  I was considering a Toyota Camry and a friend said check on the Verona - for the money the Verona is a much better deal - I love all the options.
suzuki,verona,2006,really not bad, 07/27/2006,Really Not Bad,4,"Edmunds.com really described the car in their review pretty well.  The acceleration is a little on the poor side, but it is quite smooth and going high speeds is no trouble.  I have to step on the gas when I start it because it is so quiet. but remember it is a luxury sedan, not a sports car.  I also do not hear any wind noise whatsoever.  On the handling you have to drive the car for at least 600 miles to get the feel for it. I can handle mine pretty well now.  I went from a Volvo to a Suzuki.  Overall it is different and I do like this car."
suzuki,verona,2006,happy lady, 02/16/2006,Nice Car for the Money,4,The Suzuki Verona is a nice sedan.  It rides great on the highway.  It has all the toys for a great price.  It could use about 40 more housepower though.
suzuki,verona,2006,jim, 05/28/2006,Good / OK,4,"The Suzuki Verona is a thrilling car to ride in and see out of.  It is a little more rare because you do not see many of them out on the road.  All in all I would give this car a 7/10 for performance, a 5/10 for luxury, and a 6/10 for style.  So overall, this car gets a 12 out of 20."
suzuki,verona,2006,allonmyon, 06/23/2006,Suzuki Verona,5,I love the Suzuki Verona's great feel.  It has a great ride and a great price. It just needs a little more power and you'll have a great car.
suzuki,verona,2006,Unhappy 1, 03/29/2007,Unhappy,2,"In the shop more than on the road. American Suzuki does not back their vehicle. Too many problems, much more concerning than just loss of power and loses value faster than any car I have ever owned. "
suzuki,verona,2006,Ken, 10/23/2007,Decent Car for the value,4,"I found my Verona to handle fairly decent on the highways.  It sits well and it feels a lot heavier than any economy car out there.  When driving at high speeds the Verona is as good a ride as you will get with some of the better known sedans.  Additional interior features like stereo controls in the steering provide an added bonus to owning this car which lacks popularity and resale value.  However, I have to admit that the transmission shifts awkwardly when decelerating sometimes and it's really not that great on gas.  Overall this car is a decent buy if you can get a great deal on it.  Otherwise, if you have a few hundred dollars extra to spend, I'd suggest you get a more renowned car."

Not in snow, heat, short jaunts or long highway trips. The back seat is cramped, but there's tons of headroom and at 6'1"" I always have plenty of leg room in either of the front seats.

suzuki,vitara,2001,Patrick J., 11/18/2016,Falls apart after 6-7 years,3,"I bought my 2001 Suzuki Vitara used in February 2002 with one previous owner and 14K miles on it. It was in perfect running condition and I pampered the car the entire time I owned it with monthly trips to the car wash and oil changes every 3,000 miles at Jiffy Lube with all recommended service being performed as well. Before I get into the demise of this vehicle I will warn anyone considering buying one of these, they have a ""known issue"" with O2 sensors failing every 2-3 years. Read various Suzuki forums if you don't believe me, it is notorious for this issue and Suzuki never did anything to resolve it. Expect to spend $150-$300 depending on the morals of the repair shop to have the sensor replaced, every 2-3 years. So, in 2008 my radiator sprung a leak, then the radiator hoses, then the pulleys started failing. First it was the accessory pulley, then the crank shaft pulley. Then the AC compressor and condenser both failed in the same month. Then the front brake calipers failed followed by the rear drum brake shoes. Then the tail pipe fell off, the manifold developed a leak and then the exhaust mounts failed. Thermostat failed, engine coil failed, and the rear brake light fell down. Pins that hold the bumpers on started disappearing, the handle of the oil dip stick snapped off, the interior driver door handle broke off, the exterior driver door handle snapped, the hood brace clip broke and the hinge for the fuel door has disintegrated. Now, I am not saying this vehicle isn't reliable, I put 220,000 miles on mine, but it has cost over $5,000 in repairs to keep it running. Once it hit that 6 year mark there was something each year that failed on the vehicle requiring repair. Suzuki left the US market, as a result, I would not recommend buying any Suzuki vehicle. You will run into difficulty finding parts to keep it running and the O2 sensor can and will fail on you frequently. I forgot to mention the steering knuckle also failed which required me having to find a part from China on eBay to get it repaired as the repair shop couldn't find one from any of their suppliers. I'm sending mine off to the junk yard to get whatever scrap value I can out of it.

Honestly don't remember what resolved this issue. Radiator cracked at 140K for the first time. Cracked twice after (warrantied), turns out the water pump was building too much pressure, replaced water pump. O2 sensors replaced at 160K. Maybe have spent $1000 over 5 years on maintenance (excluding oil changes, brakes, filters, tires, etc., also all labor done by my loving father). Overall this car has been very reliable and required little maintenance for an older car with exponential miles. 22-26 mpg, no difference between highway/city but winter/summer. "
suzuki,vitara,2001,Mary, 07/09/2009,2001 Suzuki Vitara JX,5, I like my vitara very much and feel very safe driving it. It handles       excellent in the snow and I have never had a problem with it when windy out.Its been very reliable and I have had it since it was new and I still love it. I would say to anyone looking to buy one that you really cant go wrong with this Vitara 2001. I have had mine 8 years now and its still going strong.I can understand why you don't see too many people selling them. Once you have one its hard to part with it. 
suzuki,vitara,2001,mensacyclist, 12/27/2003,Turned out to be a financial disaster.,3,"AVOID!!!!  I bought my Vitara in June 
of 01, got a ""good deal"", got an 
extended warranty and planned on 
keeping it for 7-8 years.  I've always 
bought Japanese in the past and would 
not consider anything else.  At 56,000 
miles the clutch went.  The dealer 
wanted $993, local mechanic needed 
about $700.  There are NO aftermarket 
parts for this car and the dealer 
parts are too expensive to be worth 
the while.  I traded the Vitara in for 
$5000 less than I owed on it and 
rolled the debt into a Dodge truck.  
My $15500 Vitara was worth about $4000 
just 2 1/2 years layer.  Check the 
blue book.....you'll be amazed at the 
deprciation.   "
suzuki,vitara,2001,msu7151, 06/15/2015,POS,2,"I purchased this vehicle in 2012 with 88,000 miles on it. It looked brand new and when I needed new brakes, the repair shop thought it was a new SUV. Since then I have driven it only 5,000 miles and have had a myriad of problems with it. The battery has been replaced four times, brakes twice, and windshield wipers, twice (still noisy). I have had to replace the oil pan, alternator and door handles. The entire underside is rusting and a recent mechanic asked me if I parked in a field because of the rust.I park in my driveway. The rocker panels are rusting. 

Now the vehicle will not start again and the catalitic converter is loose, causing all kinds of noise. Also, the a/c no longer works. "
suzuki,vitara,2001,SATX, 06/14/2008,No long-term reliability,2,"My Suzuki was great for the first few years, but once my extended warranty ran out, it started falling apart between 80k~91k. First went the auto-entry device, then the A/C, then some electrical problems started flaring up where my headlights and interior lights pulse at night, then an automated window went out, then the interior dome light shorted, and the final two kickers--it was not starting up, then finally it started dying on the road randomly and shaking and needing a time-out before I can restart it. The worst part is, either we have terrible mechanics in Texas or this is a hard car to work on, because no one can figure it out! A car should not be rendered worthless at 91k!"
suzuki,vitara,2001,Keeper, 04/12/2010,Fun Toy,4,"I bought this new to replace my 1994 Geo Metro.  With the exception of the air conditioning, this has been an ongoing issue that both the dealership and Suzuki have tried to resolve, even after the warranty had expired, but still goes out every year.  I used this car for pizza delivery for many years and it has help up great.  This is a great car especially with the top down.  I also get between 24 and 27 mpg, in town or on the highway.  I do not see differences in mileage in town or on the highway."

The driver seat is big and extremely easy to get into and out of, something that Ford has never been able to accomplish. All controls are within easy reach, and spread out enough that they are easy to find without loooking. Air controls are straightforward, and easy to use.

I like it. Nowhere near as cool as the Saturn VUE, but you get what you pay for. I prefer the side opening rear tailgate rather than the hatchback style. "

suzuki,vitara,2001,CryingFreeman, 02/13/2003,The Little SUV that Could,4,"I've purchased a used 2001 Grand Vitara 
JLX with ABS and alloy wheels.

I've love the styling and handling of 
the vehicle. It has a 155 V6 engine 
that's very quiet.

Since I'm not 6' tall, there's no 
complaints coming from me concerning 
head and leg room. It's very 
comfortable for the driver as well as 
passengers.

There's only one problem...I've noticed 
that during the cold days, the airbag 
light will stay on when you start the 
engine. It eventually goes away with 
the car is warmed up but after you 
restart it.

As I'm writing this, the SUV is in the 
dealership because it's still under 
warranty to fix this problem."
suzuki,vitara,2001,terpr, 05/26/2003,Wear your earplugs!!!,2,"I bought my Vitara with the hopes of 
having a fun, dependable ride.  What I 
got was a car that constantly creaks 
and makes noises.  I've taken it in 
twice for the same problem and it still 
makes noise!  It's the most infuriating 
thing! I dread going over a speed bump

I knew I would probabably never drive 
anther brand though would opt for more

get a new vehicle so she ended up with 
the Vitara. My Sidekick only has 170000

I will have to say the up keep and cost have been a little intense since 150K miles but well worth the trade off. The fuel tank wires frayed (easy fix), Alternator (new brushes 14.95), rear brake shoes (178K miles), differential fluid change (180K make sure you check if your around alot of high water) and Mobil 1 high milage synth every 3,000 miles. Still running strong. Ive change the front brakes 3x and finally went to cryo rotors with synth pads. Worst problem, A/C pump failed and a/c leaks. Other then the A/C I use maybe 1/4 qt of oil every third fill up. Not bad in my book. www.oemsuzukiparts.com"
suzuki,vitara,2002,Army Veteran, 07/29/2002,A Genuine Mini 4-Wheeler,4,"The vehicle has been a pleasant 
surprise in comparison with the Jeep 
Wrangler.  Unlike some competitors it 
has a 4WD Hi/4WD Lo  transfer case, and 
is based on a true ""truck"" body. It has 
less than half the turning radius of a 
Jeep Wrangler.  The rack-and-pinion 
steering has a more precise feel. I 
also got the advertised 25 mpg mileage, 
which is 40% better than the Jeep. The 
torquy 16-valve DOHC 2 liter four 
breathes freely at top end.  Too bad 
Jeep doesn't make this little 4-wheeler!"
suzuki,vitara,2002,Jonny Matrix, 10/08/2002,"SUV wannabe, well worth the title",4,"I was very skeptical about this vehicle 
at first.  I am a frequent traveller, 
and being in the military, it's 
understandable that a vehicle with 
storage capacity's needed.  Having had 
an Isuzu Rodeo with a 4 cyl engine, I 
experienced that the vehicle was too 
heavy for its engine.  I also needed 
something with a decent fuel economy.
Having have had a brand new Vitara for 
about a month now, and putting on 2800 
miles, it's proven to me more than 
worthy.  It is definitely one good way 
to start in an SUV, and I should have 
done so sooner."

disappointed.  I am very disheartened 
by its weak engine, though.  Whenever I 
am using the cruise control on even the 
slightest of inclines, the engine 
struggles and does not maintain a

I have driven the heck out of this thing for 111,000 miles, and the only thing repaired has been a brake switch (wouldn't allow me to take it out of Park.) That was a mystery at about 60,000 miles.  Gas mileage is mid 20's, it has the perfect amount of cargo space for my small family, and the vehicle size is perfect for heavy traffic and parking garages here in Hawaii (yes, we shipped it from the East Coast; couldn't bear to part with it!)

Reliability has been top notch and I take it places where people say ""how did you get that up here"". It is underpowered and consequently fuel mileage is so-so, I can't wait to get my hands on an 09 2.4L 4 cylinder - more power, more room, and better mileage (I hope).Had one since 1990 - probably always will.

I have only had it for a year, but I haven't had ANY problems mechanical, electrical or otherwise.  I drove across the country with it and it is still in superb condition.

suzuki,xl-7,2001,srk2040, 02/20/2013,You can't find any other car for this price and performance during 2001.,4,"Had the car from dealer's lot brand new.
Few facts about this car:
1) the engine bay has a flex bar across it
2) the frame is liquid filled to reduce vibration
3) came with direct electronic ignition as opposed to plugs and wires.
4) has third row of seat.
5) OEM tires are exact same as Lexus RX300, Dueler HT.

The front brake wears out lot quicker than what I'm used to. Amazingly, the rear drum brake has never been changed and it always passes the inspection. It's on 170,000 mile now.

Comes with lot of upgrade if you really into it. I installed rear catch net, rear door net storage, window rain deflector.

Overall, you can not find any other car like this even today 2013 that is true 4x4"

This year I am told the cost is $1,000+ just for the part condenser or compressor??  And it had to have a dual air conditioner. :-( The car is probably not even worth that much. Too bad that the dealer were so bad on fixing this one problem.  Other than that, the car has been perfect.  Love the fact that the gasoline door is on the passenger side. It's fully loaded and got what I paid for . .no repairs other than regular maintenance-not bad for an 8yr old car. Body and interior in perfect condition still."

This XL-7 has been awesome. Dealer repairs VERY expensive. Driver seat back torn out due to years of toddler abuse (LoL). Car still drives like new. Fast steering - handles very similar to my Miata in fact - may give some used to the GM slush boxes some fun in the wind at highway speeds. Only problem was aluminum chips in early production A/C compressors caused a lot of failures in 01 02 XL-7s; and replacement / system flush averaged between $2000 and $2500 at the dealers.

the cupholders are inconvienient.

with the RAV4, but looks and feels more

have used a little more thought.  The 
radio is mounted low on the dash, and 
the third row should just be folded 
down, because no one could sit back 
there.  Excellent service on vehicle so 
far."

day-time running light, automatically

good gas mileage for a 7-seater. (21 
mile per gallon) 
The best part is the 0% interest on car

I purchased my XL7 in 2001 so here goes.
I would purchase another for the same
reasons. My four children and Spouse are
able to go anywhere the larger SUV's
tread, yet we find parking not a problem
due to the layout and size. Economy
could get a boost yet, I pulled a 2000lb
trailer with ease and yes, all four
children and Mom were present. If you
want a rugged and  refined SUV that
delivers towing capacity and looks great
at the theater which fits in a parking
lot, than go buy one. 0% financing was a
fabulous bonus. You won't regret passing
up the Blazer for it.
Ask for the Fuel warning light, I still
can't locate mine."

also needed to carry up to 7 people 
(mostly kids) from time to time. The XL-
7 has delivered on all counts. It's 
large enough to carry what I need, but 
not too large to make it hard to park

 Price was my original 
strong motivation to buy. For twenty 
thousand it is a good deal.Only small 
details have been noticed. Such as the 
lack of useable arm rests,seeing and 
using the radio are not always easy. My 
husband is an aircraft enginieer. He on 
the other hand found other small 
problems that i never noticed. He 
advised me that the tires are shot 
after only 16000 miles. This is after 
two tire rotations. Also the defroster 
funtion is inadaqute when the vehicle 
is filled with passengers.Overall, 
Fully loaded four wheel drive still 
can't beat it for the price!"

Which the dealer fixed.  After only 2 years and 24000 miles the tires were bald.  Though was told that it was not a suzuki problem.  (though it is known that the tires are horrible on the XL7).  I recently lost the gas door cover because the clamp inside rotted.  Though again not the dealers problem.  The 3rd row seat is unusable.  Children barely fit never mind and adult.  And the gas mileage is horrible.  The inside is cheap looking.  But it does have many cup holders and a light in the ashtray.  I would not recommend this SUV.  Instead get a Toyato Rav 4.  Had that before.

The four wheel drive is excellent.  And, I like the versatility of the third row seat.  However, better quality interior materials would be nice to consider as a future improvement.  My son frequently rested his feet on the rear passenger seat when he was a toddler so that the pocket on the back seat ripped open.  In my opinion, for a car that is marketed to moms with kids, the seat ripped a little too easily.  And, the plastic trim around the sunroof has an annoying habit of coming loose.  Despite these minor issues, it is a solid car."

The dash organization is poorly done.  The radio is on the bottom of the dash and hard to reach and see, which I think makes it a danger to change stations when driving.  As far as the driving of the vechicle, it's okay on a perfect day with NO wind.  With even the slightest wind, it's nearly impossible to handle, for male and especially female adults.  We've even been told we look like drunk drivers and believe me it's the car, not our skills. "

standard features. And, it is nice to 
have a vehicle that isn't like every

about 21mpg mixed/24mpg highway. It

I keep running into owners with the same year and model and they're all boasting high mileage with little problems. 100,000 miles ago I had a problem with one side of the catalytic converter. The cost, $900, never got the other side done. Other repairs:power windows, a heating element, freon for the AC. I never had a tuneup, transmission flush, or any maintenance, just regular oil changes. The only thing I don't like is the 17/20/mpg cost because I drive an average of 20,000 miles a year, there is no icon that reminds you gas is low (ran out several times), and now a slow oil leak -2qts a month."
suzuki,xl-7,2002,blahblah83, 07/06/2016,215k miles and still going strong!,4,"I have had my 2002 XL7 for nearly 10 years now. Second Owner. I have gone from 91k miles up to 215k and it's still running like a champ despite my lack of consistent maintenance. I've gone through all the normal stuff like tires, breaks, batteries, windshield wipers, headlights, oil changes and have very few complaints. 1 - not quite enough space for a rear-facing infant carrier. I have to pull up the passenger front seat to the point where only a small adult would be able to sit comfortably. I'm 5'7"" and can't sit as a passenger up front with a rear facing infant seat in the vehicle. 2 - I've got a bit of an oil leak and lose about 2 qts a month. 3 - my fuel economy has dropped to an average of 13-15 mpg regardless of city or highway miles. BUT THAT'S IT. Everything else about this vehicle has been amazing. It handles more like a car but after putting a tow hitch on myself (ridiculously super easy by the way to do so) I've been able to tow trailers and even drift boats without any issues. My XL7 handles well on both sand and even pebbly river banks (with a trailer even). It handles well in the snow and even ice, though I would suggest adding a few sandbags for extra weight when there is ice on the road for more than a day. It's a great height for transporting both kids and dogs as both can easily climb in and out on their own. There are child LATCHes which make it easy for child car-seats, booster-seats, and infant carriers to be snapped in and secured quickly. Overall, I have been thoroughly impressed and VERY PLEASED with my XL7. Like I said 215k miles and still going strong!

Snow, sleet, rain, high winds - no problem.

I never really thought I would like a utility vehicle but this one has surprised me. Corners well easy to handle and I can see out all around. Great little truck. I would highly recommend it to anyone that needs a 4X4 and it sports plenty of room and a third row seat for my grandchildren. My teenage daughter even likes to drive it. Very stylish looking and I would definitely buy another one.  Best vehicle I have ever owned and I have had quite a few. "
suzuki,xl-7,2002,LadyDarya, 12/01/2009,Watch out for the air compressor,3,My advice is to do serious research on the XL-7.  The a/c compressor has a serious habit of freezing up and breaking the drive belt.  This is not a cheap fix.  I pulled the B04 relay and just went without the a/c.  Brakes are not that great and go out frequently and trying to find someone outside the dealership to work on it is not fun! Oh and the 2001 and 2002 models tend to loose their gas door (as in it comes off).
suzuki,xl-7,2002,NioGio, 01/01/2007,Classy Little Ride,4,"Back in '96 I purchased a new Suzuki Tracker 4x4 convertible. It was probably the best all around vehicle I have ever owned...fun to drive, never got stuck ANYWHERE, stingy on the gas and an easy to maintain stylish interior(for the money). So in 2000, when Chevy introduced the Chevy Tracker 4dr 4x4...I just HAD to have it! It had an upgraded goodies package that raised the price to $21,000. I couldn't WAIT to turn that thing in when the lease was up, it was awful and nothing but problems! In 2005 I came across a used XL-7, took it for a test drive and fell in love all over again. It is everything I loved about the Sidekick in a bigger, beefier package! Sorry Chevy, but Suzuki wins this one hands down."
suzuki,xl-7,2002,Shannon, 04/08/2007,Not terrible,3,"Good price for an SUV with third row seat which is WAY too small for frequent use.  My husband hates this car, but It never gave us a problem until the service engine light came on at 60k miles.  It turned out to be a bad O2 sensor for $250.  On maybe 5 different occasions, the belt squealed briefly when turning on the A/C then stopped.  I should have taken it to the shop immediately. At 100,000 miles, the A/C compressor locked up and caused the belt to break - a $1,400 repair in total. Fuel efficiency is horrible, avg 17-20 mpg.  "

She wanted something newer to drive. Second owner said just needed to pay for some medical expenses for his kid, reasonable, and said hadn't had it long. In love soon as I drove it, and had it almost 2 years. Have had brake problems, sticks in gear sometimes(5spd), and dies occasionally, but needs some maintenance to keep up when taxes come. 4x4 works amazing.

months, many trips to the dealer, hours 
of agony, and countless phone calls to 
Suzuki, I discovered that the exhaust 
system on the 2002 XL-7 was redesigned, 
and to repair my vehicle, I would need 
to replace the ENTIRE exhaust system, 
cost about $2000. To make it worse, 
Suzuki can't produce a tail pipe for a

never drive a car again!  Truck rides and drives GREAT!  I no longer get
tired on long trips!  Daughter loves the rear air, extra leg room, and reclining 
rear seats.  We didn't need third row seating, but had to buy that way to get 
rear air.  We removed third row seat cushion and that provided flat load floor. 
 Still needs cargo net to keep groceries from falling out on feet when rear

they use for the visors is too filmsy 
and not long enough to block the sun 
when you use it for side use. Overall 
this SUV is worth the price and has 
enough room to spare and using the 4 
Wheel drive is fun. Oh !! I do have one 
issue that I am too lazy to go to get 
fixed, is that sometimes the radio LEDS 
go dim in the daylight whichs makes it 
hard to see the station and clock. One

My XL-7 feels heavy but still it is still fun and sporty to drive.  It did really well at the off-road course I took last year.  The only problem I had was a coolant leak which may be the dealer's fault.  I recommend regular trans/diff fluid changes.  And the original tires are lousy, mine were bald at 15,000 miles.  Go with Yokohamas, mine are still like new after 30,000 miles.  I solved my oil filter access problem by cutting a hole at the wheel well and bolted on an aluminum sheet door.  The colored weather strips have all faded."
suzuki,xl-7,2002,Luka, 06/04/2002,Listen to owners not reviewers,4,"The reviewers seem to have a bias against 
the XL7.  Many of their criticisms are 
accurate, but of little significance if 
you are purchasing this vehicle based on 
needs rather than on how it stacks up 
against a Lexus or BMW car-ute.  This is 
a little truck that will tow 3000 pounds 
and 
handle much more rigorous terrain than 
the AWD ""car-utes"". I'm stepping down 
from a 1984 
Toyota Land Cruiser with 210,000 mi.  
This was the ONLY little ute to meet my 
criteria between a mix of true truck-like 
utility and durability and on road 
manners and economy. Check your needs, 
not the 
reviews...and see what owners think of 
this totally under appreciated vehicle. "

This SUV has
been the BEST car ever.
It's 4WD gets you through the tough winters...the only thing the SUV lacks is the comfort and luxury.
It now has $122K on it...I am ready for something new....I wish the new ones had a comfortable seat...and came standard with more of the luxury items..."

Live in NYC, bad roads etc. Still solid. Blew a wheel bearing at 90k (bad roads) quick repair cheap (not at the dealer). Too bad they had to ruin it with the 08 models. They had a good SUV at a good price. Hope mine lasts another 5 years. "
suzuki,xl-7,2002,lara, 05/18/2006,XL-7 review,2,"I am so disappointed with this vehicle. The third row is too small for even my children to fit comfortably. The car has electrical problems, the keyless entry doesn't work, my interior light and headlights go out frequently and need to be replaced. I have had problems with my brakes (I don't know if its the car or the place that keeps fixing them)."

model which I've purchsed.  It's not the most comfortable vehicle, but it does 
seat seven reasonably.  If you want 7 seating and have 7 full sized adults, 
don't even think about this car.  If you have 2 or more small children and 2 
adults then consider this vehicle.  

If you can afford Acura MDX, I say go for that.  I understand it rides much 
better."

I recently took it on a road trip and it did wonderful. This truck is a keeper until it's time to trade it in and even then It'll be for another XL- 7.
suzuki,xl-7,2002,Todd Scales, 05/01/2002,Best Value Hands Down,4,"The XL7 is the perfect answer to a 
growing family wanting safety and 
versatility. It has achieved enviable 
scores in crash tests and rollover 
resistance tests. It comfortably seats 
7 for typical needs (scouting trips, 
little league, etc.). It has great 
pickup, handles well, has micron air 
filters in the AC, heated mirrors ... 
the list goes on; and it does all this 
at a price typical of much smaller 
vehicles. Sound system is more than 
adequate."

purchase. The limited has all the 
creature comforts. Leather is very 
comfortable. Once you figure out the 
seats they are easy to use. It is easy 
to drive and the interior is well 
thought out. IT is great looking too.
Gas mileage so far (just under 1000

suzuki,xl-7,2002,CK, 08/27/2002,Excellent Value,4,"Our family has had the XL-7 for a month 
now, and are very pleased with the 
vehicle. 

First, it has high value as it provides 
more features than it's competitors do 
compared to selling price.

Second, the exterior styling is 
pleasing -it's lean and clean. 

Third, the interior is comfortable and 
the ride is very smooth for a truck. 
Controls are logically positioned. 

Lastly, the third row seat is a 
definate plus. 
 
Overall, the  quality is very high in 
all aspects.

The XL-7 is a great alternative to a 
mini-van and is a lot of fun to drive.  
There is a lot to like about this 
vehicle compared to what you pay for it."

We wanted 3 seats, leather, sunroof, 
4wd, not too big, not too small,and 
great build quility and comfort. The 
more we searched the more we found out 
that there really are not many choices 
if you did not want to spend over $30k."
suzuki,xl-7,2002,Rich C., 09/19/2002,Good looking and inexpensive SUV,4,"Overall My wife and I are pleased with 
our XL-7. It handles well and has good 
pickup for a smaller V-6. We enjoy the 
CD player, and the A/C works well. I 
would like to have seen a few more 
upgrades ,such as a low fuel warning 
light, door ajar lights (especially 
since we have a small child), and a 
power lock switch on the passenger side 
door. The third rear seat is nice 
despite that it really only seats 
children or short adults! We got a good 
deal on it, especially with the zero 
interest financing for 5 years.
The only problem so far has been the 
front disc brakes squealing from time 
to time. We have had them fixed once, 
but the problem has since reoccured."

traded it in and thanks to a dealer 
incentive lost no equity on an already 
reasonably priced vehicle.  I really 
wasn't sure what to expect but so far 
at 4200 miles I am still very happy 
with my purchase.  I opted for the 
automatic and no 3rd seat. The cargo 
room is great and no stoplight 
shifting for me.  If you have more 
money than brains like most Americans, 
you need to spend 30K on an overpriced 
SUV.  If you want results for a 
reasonable price, then I reccommend 
the Suzuki XL-7."

excellent build quality."

I own a Silverado and love it, but I 
now prefer to drive this little 4X4.  
The fuel economy has been better than 
expected and my kids love the DVD/TV 
screen and sunroof.  My wife loves the 
heated seats and the window locks.  The 
on demand 4X4 is so much better than 
all-wheel drive. The four-wheel drive 
goes into gear on the fly (like my 
Chevy) and we both feel much safer 
transporting the kids to school and 
back.  

I am extremely surprised how well in 
handles and the freeway and the perky 
engine.  So far we are very satified."

a little squashy but still are very 
good when stopping is a must. The back 
hach opening is a dream. Opening from

better and convenient.
The 4wd in bad winter conditions has

approximately 11,000 miles on it

fun to drive, very economical and has 
presented few problems. There is a 
recurring ""rattle"" because the hood 
adjustment keeps getting loose and 
the front passenger seatbelt 
malfunctioned and was replaced, but 
other than that - no problems. It 
would be nice if Suzuki would make 
the seats a little more comfortable, 
too. It is easy to park, corners very 
well and is easy to control in windy, 
storm conditions. The moonroof 
opens easily for just a little 
ventilation, or for a more ""open-air"" 
experience. A very fun, reliable and 
economical vehicle overall."

professional, the ride is quiet and 
refined, the seven year transferable 
no deductible power train warranty (3 
year bumper to bumper) is outstanding. 
You don't pay for a bunch of extra 
doodads. 
The XL-7 is two inches narrower than 
the ML 320, and is maneuverable, as a 
result. 
The XL-7 is truck based but rides like 
a car and has a part-time 4x4 
capacity, which can be switched to at 
up to 60 mph.
The XL-7 has done quite well in crash 
tests. The XL-7 has crunch zones, anti-
lock brakes, beams in the doors, 
pretensioners on the seat belts, and 
second generation air bags.
We've been surprised by the high 
initial quality."

often. The XL-7 has been running on the

was quieter, handled better and was 
more roomy than many of the bigger

solid vehicle.  This vehicle is

middle seat to get into the rear.  
Exceptional sound from the 4 speaker/1 
subwoofer CD player.  We added chrome 
nerfbars to help with the kids getting 
in and out and helps prevent door 
dings.  The driving lights really help 
in rain and foggy conditions and help 
shine where the headlights (very

The only problem I've had besides normal wear and tear was the ABS kicking in prematurely when I first bought it. Once the problem was fixed with my warranty the car has been nothing but awesome! The gas mileage is average, but the way the car handles and the fun I have driving it makes up for it. I was sad to find out I'd have to get rid of it, due to child #3 and no room, but I am trading it in for a newer XL-7 with a 3rd row seat. I have driven several SUVs, this has been the best by far!

The body has held up as well as the engine. This car is comfortable, looks great and is the most reliable car I've ever owned. Hoping to get another 100,000 reliable miles out of it :)"
suzuki,xl-7,2003,Snookie, 02/22/2005,Sleeping Giant (well in spirit @least),4,"We have owned this XL-7 for 2 years.  It is the 13th car we have owned but by far the best value for the money.  Have had Fords Dodges and Hondas all nice but this one really beats them all, hands down.  All the toys and goodies of an expensive SUV with the reliablity of a solid Japanese Mfg.  It may not be big is stature but it is a Giant in value."
suzuki,xl-7,2003,rey, 09/01/2010,Great Vehicle,4,"I purchased my Suzuki Grand Vitara Xl-7 brand new in 2003.. I depend quite a bit on my vehicle for work and require a reliable vehicle that I know I can count on. this vehicle has been a great find and has surpassed my expectations. with over 100,000 miles I have yet to invest in any repairs or huge maintenance costs. good quality vehicle that you know you can count on for many years to come. "
suzuki,xl-7,2003,cologuy, 04/20/2008,Colorado Cruising,4,"Overall this is a reliable vehicle. We have not had any maintenance issues. It has a snappy acceleration. I just had to get used to the power coming on at 3000 rpm. On the highway the ride is great except for a little road noise but not that bad. Around town the lady likes it for in and out of parking lots. Gas mileage is about 17 mpg in town and 21 to 23 on highway. The car survived quite well after being rear ended buy a F250 super duty ford diesel, impact was absorbed by the rear door mounted spare. After repair it is still driving great."
suzuki,xl-7,2003,giraffedan, 04/11/2012,All good but the 4wd,3,"It is overall very reliable, and works well. Power wen I need it, fuel efficient for its size when i baby it.
4wd on the other hand failed.
My mom complained about the 4wd for years and mechanics said thats just how suzuki 4wds work.
I finally brought it to the Suzuki dealership where they said the same thing. i asked them to just take a look.
Their senior mechanic said he has never seen a 4wd fall apart like that. He said it would cost at least $800 just to take it apart and see what is wrong. Only other complaint is that the belt they used is too skinny so it squeaks every morning if it is under 40 degrees.
If the 4wd still worked it would be a perfect car.
Suggestions would be great"
suzuki,xl-7,2003,crach, 01/29/2004,My suzuki X-L7,4,"The car runs smoothly on both highway 
and local roads. Is able to easily 
acellerate onto highways. Has no 
problem in snow, we had a bad winter 
last year one storm was over 30"" our XL-
7 never got stuck. Gas milage could be 
better it gets around 15 miles/gallon 
around town, 19/gallon highway. It's 
had two recalls both were quickly 
repaired by the dealer. I love the ABS 
braking, it's worked well on slippery 
rain slicked roads."
suzuki,xl-7,2003,Lesley385, 02/27/2004,Could be better,3,"Nice fully loaded SUV; however, too 
expensive when considering the poor

into the side of me and I barely felt 
a thing. He was going 45 mph when he 
hit, so if you have kids you can rest 
easy that they'll be safe."

environment. "
suzuki,xl-7,2003,Nadia Adams, 07/16/2008,A very good buy in more ways then one!,4,"My husband and I are Jeep lovers, when we met we both had Suzuki Samari's. We spent the last 2 years looking for the best vehicle to upgrade with. But after our son came along we were even more anxious on finding a dependable and secure Jeep to transport our bundle of joy. We stubbled across a pearl white XL7, after the test drive we were sold not to mention that it was in great condition and had low mileage. It looks good but when we have family outtings & picnics it accomdates everything from bodies to bags! My husband has even taken the Jeep filled with friends on an island tour of our country Barbados and every passenger was so comfortable during the ride they feel at intervals!"

virtually the same vehicle. I love 
this truck...Yes a truck, not an awd 
car type SUV. Suzuki has been doing it 
right for many years and The Grand 
Vitara/XL-7 is one of their finest. 
The 3rd row of seats sold me! Oh yah, 
Durango has 7 pass seating but I 
didn't have $10,000 more and uh, try 
sitting in the back of one. Love my XL-
7!"
suzuki,xl-7,2003,jack wright, 06/05/2006,Great Little SUV,3,"My Suzuki is the best 4WD SUV that money can buy. I bought it used with 10,000 miles on it and know have 50,000. It has a trailer hitch, factory, and pulls my motorcycle great even in the mountains. Its off road performance is excellent.  The factory tires, Brigestones, are only fair and lasted 30,000 miles.  I found a worthy cheap replacement Kumos at only $350.00 for four.  Its reliability has been excellent."
suzuki,xl-7,2003,Phil Dee, 03/29/2004,Satisfied Customer,3,"Was looking for a smaller SUV that 
would move more than 5 people 
occasionally. This has worked just as 
we had expected. Its not built to be 
the big 7 passenger SUV - it works for 
a mix of adults & kids. The ride is 
great and the features more than 
adequate, all for a reasonable price! 
It might not be suitable for larger 
people, but its exactly what we were 
looking for."

I loved the looks of it and the 4x4 was what I really needed because I live in a flood area.
It proved itself this past week when I came across a flooded road going home one night going home from work.
It didn't look that deep but by the time I was half way thru the water was coming over the hood.
It never lost power or traction.
I passed a car stuck half way thru and the looks on their faces was priceless as they watched me drive (or possibly floating) by.
I was scared but the adrenalin rush when I made it to the end was priceless. Had a little water in the passenger floor board.
Other than that ALL DRY!!"
suzuki,xl-7,2003,xl7lover, 07/18/2007,Love this car,5,"Just as great as a Toyota made super well! Reliable, handles super, great 4 wheel drive. Hugs the road, extremely reliable. Good on gas. First time buyer and we were really impressed. Has a 3rd row which comes in handy when needed. "
suzuki,xl-7,2003,Susan, 05/06/2008,Vehicle,4,"This is my 2nd Suzuki and really like the performance, value and mileage. Getting a fully loaded XL-7 for 10k lower than everyone else makes this vehicle very affordable! My salesperson really knew her stuff, but sitting in the XL-7 actually sold itself. And talk about performance, someone drove my vehicle and said it drove like his Tahoe. I recommend you test drive one and you'll never buy anything ele.  Unbelievable value for your hard-earned dollars!  "

suzuki,xl-7,2003,mrwagner, 04/13/2004,Nice,4,"Bought the car last month.  Test drove 
Element, Tribute, and Forester. The XL-
7 was all around much nicer to drive 
and had many more features for about 
the same price or less.  Interior is 
nicer than our Audi.  Have also 
previously owned a Trooper, Cherokee,

handles better and is queiter than any 
of those hogs."

My only problem is that my CD player just stopped working my friend who also has the XL7 had the same problem with her CD player and a CD got stuck in hers. I was able to get my CD out but it just doesn't play at all. Other than that I love it, It has an automatic starter (not sure who added that but it is a plus) I would buy another one...but hope this one last a long time."

easy to get in and out of as a minivans 
third row -- the kids don't care -- 
they love it!  I love the car and feel 
that it is a great value.  0% financing

great choice."
suzuki,xl-7,2003,BobP, 06/12/2003,Very Good for the Money,4,"So far it has been a great SUV for me. 
It is the first I have owned. I looked 
at many others in this class and most 
were much more expensive, were less 
roomy, and the interior materials 
looked cheaper. The Suzuki was above 
average in all of these areas. The 
build quality is excellent. The engine 
and transmission are quiet and smooth. 
So far in mixed driving I am getting 
20mph. There is plenty of cargo space 
and comfort."

wanted and we still have 7 seats for 
emergencies, although you do have to 
adjust the 2nd and 3rd row just right 
to make everyone comfy.The XL7 is on a 
sturdy truck frame and has a real and 
simple manual 4wd system.The engine is 
not a power dynamo but adequate and 
very smooth with the liquid filled 
engine mounts and 32 valve config.The 
engine using a timing chain instead of 
a belt also appealed to me. Gas mileage 
is better than expected, getting 22-23 
on the open road and 18-19 in city 
driving.It is simple and practicle in 
engineering and design but comes with a 
host of standard features. "
suzuki,xl-7,2003,First Time Suzuki, 08/06/2003,Nice Vehicle for the price.,4,"I checked out a few SUV's including the 
Isuzu Trooper, Honda Pilot, Isuzu 
Rodeo, Toyota Highlander, Ford Escape 
and many others. I finally ended up 
with the XL-7 Limited. For the money, 
this SUV is great. The leather is 
supple, the front dash looks very nice. 
The wooden trims combined with chrome 
accents give the interior a very 
expensive look. I especially like the 
part where the front cup holders and 
space are completely covered with the 
same interior color plastic. The self 
illuminous dash light is very easy to 
read during the day or night. 
More engine power, power seats and 2'nd 
3'rd row shoulder to shoulder seating 
space need to be enhanced/added.  "
suzuki,xl-7,2003,VABeloved, 08/20/2003,Most Features For Your Money,4,"I was pleasantly surprised with the XL-
7.  I was in the market for something 
bigger for my growing family (previous 
car 2000 Camry, another EXCELLENT 
car).  I was interested in 3rd row 
SUVs, but didn't think we could afford 
one.  Heard a radio ad for the XL-7 and 
decided to check it out even though I 
was not a big fan of Suzuki.  Was very 
surprised by the smooth ride (husband 
owns Isuzu Rodeo--ROUGH ride) and the 
luxurious look and feel of the interior 
and exterior.  Very well loaded for a 
total price of @ 22K.  Gas mileage 
(main concern for an SUV) is not as bad 
as you would expect either."

trim and fit.  Power is in hurt

it all."

suzuki,xl-7,2003,Captain Wade, 07/20/2003,Pearl White XL7 Limited,4,"With 5800 miles under my belt I have to 
say the XL7 is a great car. I have the 
Limited package that makes the car look 
like a $40K SUV. Everyone laughs when I 
tell them it's a Suzuki, they don't 
believe itme  Full leather, sun roof 
power everything. And the extra room 
the XL has is great. I just brought 
home two 60 inch beches for my boat. 
One in the cargo area and on on the 
roof with the optional racks attached. 
Let me see a RAV4 or even the new KIA 
pull that one off. And 7 seats to beet! 
The longer wheel base really helps the 
ride a well. Definately worth a second 
look.

Captain Wade"
suzuki,xl-7,2003,Mr.XYZ, 07/30/2003,Gimme an import!,4,"This is the second SUV I have owned. I 
previously owned a Ford Escape. While 
the pickup and overall power were 
better in the Ford, it handled like a 
dump truck. I was afraid to take a turn 
for fear of turning over.

 I intensionally took sharp angled 
turns at above normal speeds during my 
test drive. The wheels were glued to 
the road. I never had the sensation 
of ""holding on for dear life"" while 
attacking the turns.

 I like the center console instead of 
the steering column gear shifter. The 
wood trim is a nice touch. It is also a 
sharp looking vehicle from the outside. 

Overall, a quality vehicle ot a 
reasonable price. "
suzuki,xl-7,2003,malexa00, 08/12/2003,best kept secret,5,"Just purchased the XL-7 Touring model 
without the 3rd row seat. Very happy 
so far. Comes with a lot of standard 
features for the price paid.
The size of the XL-7 is somewhere 
between the compact SUV's (Rav-4, CRV) 
and the mid-large SUV's (Pilot, 
Explorer).
Fun to Drive.
If Suzuki came out with a full size 
SUV it would give the Explorer and 
Pilot a lot of competition."

The engine is significantly quiter than 
all other SUVs under 35K range we have 
test driven.   2). The road manner is 
smooth and comfortable, more car-
like.   3). The exterior and interior 
are satisfactorily decent.   4). Hard-

Isuzu, Mitsubishi and others no 
so popular brands like Kia. Except the

nice impression. After 2 months of 
testing My wife and 
I pick the Suzuki. It was the best 
value for the money; I like the ride, 
the power and the build quality. 
Really nice sound system also. The 
only reason why this

it. The style is contemporary. Interior 
is beautiful and plush. There is plenty 
of cargo room. The ride and quietness 
is almost better than my 35K sedan. I 
drove several SUVs in the low 20's and 
this one by far could compete with

I didn't know Suzuki had a larger sized 
SUV. For a minute there I though it was 
a customer vehicle!

The XL7 is a great value. I bought the 
Limited, 3 rows, leather seats, 
excellent sound system, sun roof etc.

I looked around, feature by feature,

the Honda Pilot, Mitsubishi Montero,
Volvo XC-90, and the Infiniti QX-4. 
Aside from the XC-90 the Suzuki XL-7 is
technically comparable except for a few
minor conveniences.  Also in price the
XL-7 is practically half the price of
the XC-90 which was the biggest sellin

find the XL-7 an excellent buy for a
solid and safe SUV.  "

$0.36 a mile and be home on weekends.

EX3 fully loaded to haul our 2 kids
around.  All I can say is that I'm
surprised that it offered the same
things as the Honda Pilot!  Plus, the
interior design is nicer, there's
standard wood trim, and the leather is
softer too.  185HP isn't a lot in the
midsize class, but if you need basic
transportation and don't need to tow 
you're absolutely fine.    We recently
took a 200 mile trip with our kids and a
crowded trunk with luggage on the
rooftop and I can safely say this car
never ran out of breath.  I'm glad I

suzuki,xl-7,2004,Trish, 07/05/2006,Durable but Needs to have a Better Ride,3,I enjoy driving my XL-7 around town but do not like taking it on long trips due to the rough ride. The ride is very bumpy and uncomfortable. I read that the '07 model will have a smoother ride. If that's the case I wouldn't hesitate to consider purchasing one. The price and warranty are good. Its reliability is good. I have not had any problems.
suzuki,xl-7,2004,Rob and Family, 12/01/2004,NO Regrets,4,"Never considered a Suzuki until I test
drove a friend's. Couldn't believe the
ride & creature comforts. Suzuki bent
over backwards to to give the most for
your money. My wife & I were looking at
Rav 4 & Highlander but to get it equipped
the way the Suzuki was equipped would've
bumped the price well up into the mid
30's. The choice of Suzuki was a no brainer."
suzuki,xl-7,2004,Ed Eskew, 04/21/2005,I Like My XL-7,4,"My 2004 Suzuki XL-7 has been a reliable and fun to drive truck. 3The 3rd row seats are not particularly roomy, but serve the purpose when we need to carry a few more kids. Its ride is a little harsh, but not jolting, and this is an ""SUV"". It handles and rides much better than most of the big truck-based SUVs I've driven. My milage was a little less than I had expected, but still better than most trucks. I suppose that the aerodynamics play a part in that."
suzuki,xl-7,2004,bb, 01/06/2006,2004 XL-7,4,"We have owned our Suzuki XL-7 for 1 1/2 years.  The reason I bought it was the warranty, the design, and the trade in deal they gave me.  It feels very solid and handles well, I am 6 feet tall and there is a lot of headroom.  I think the XL-7 could be a bit longer, but it is adeqaute with smaller kids.  We have the 3rd row seat which is very tight.  If the SUV was a foot longer the 3rd row would be a bit more pratical. We bought out XL-7 with 6,000 miles on it for $20000, $15,000 with our trade.  The dealer gave me $5,000 for a 1994 Ford Explorer Limited with 99,000 miles on it.  My wife likes the size of the XL-7 and finds it easy to navigate.  She feels safe driving in snow with the 4WD."
suzuki,xl-7,2004,grntd22, 08/10/2006,Check It Out,3,The Suzuki XL-7 is a great SUV.  It would be much better though if they offered more power and towing capacity. the 2.7 liter engine is too weak.
suzuki,xl-7,2004,2004 Suzuki XL-7, 12/28/2004,Suzuki XL-7,4,"This vehicle needs a wider wheel base 
and extended flaps on visors to block 
drivers eyes from sun only. Everything 
else is great. Maybe a back door that 
opens away from curb rather then to the 
curb. The handling is sweet, likes its 
on clouds. The headlights are 
remarkably bright. No DVD player tho 
for the wife n kids??? Honda Odessy has 
one up on you. Ever consider getting 
rid of the ""7 passenger"" title to make 
more leg room and rear storage?? try 
it, you might be surprised."
suzuki,xl-7,2004,Sherri, 08/10/2005,I love it!,4,"I love this SUV!  I've had it a year and I still enjoy it.  The only thing I dislike about it is the rear door.  If someone parks to close to you, you can't open it, as it swings out instead of up.  "

vehicle.Contrary to the reviews ,I find 
that my XL 7 has infinite possibities 
for cargo and passengers. The third row 
seating converts in a second to flat 
storage after shopping and changes back 
to a bench just as quick for toting the 
kids carpool. Seriously, the 3rd row is 
cramped for adults but fine for 
children. It's compromise between 
storage and extra seating.This is my 
ninth new car purchase and by far, my 
favorite."

with loan in hand at 4.89% and knowing 
we could get the 2003 model for 21,000 
after rebate on carsdirect.com. We went 
to Green Valley Ford Suzuki in 
Fairfield California(Bay Area).We got a

unheard of.  They also matched our loan 
and got it at 3.99%  Has all electric, 
cd with subwoofer and tweeters, rear 
air, seats 7 , mats, allow wheels, 
automatic w/overdrive, woodgrain

easy to handle. We are amazed at where 
we have taken it in 4wd.A truly great 
all round suv.  Will buy another when 
this one is several years old.  
Reliability is unsurpassed as is the 
quality.  An excellent buy."
suzuki,xl-7,2004,Jeremy, 04/16/2005,You can not find a better value in a SUV,4,"I actually did not plan on buying this vehicle when I visited the dealership. I sat in one on the showroom floor and was amazed.  Our other vehicle is a 2003 Ford Explorer Limited and for a mere $9000 less the XL-7 blows it away.  The only option missing is power seats. Fuel economy is a little lower on the highway than rated but most of my travel is above 70 mph.  Overall it is a quiet smooth ride.  There are no options on the EX version, everything is standard."

when a friend recommened I take a look 
at the 2004 Suzuki XL-7 EXIII.  I took 
one out for a test drive could not 
believe the ride, handling, and good 
gas mileage.  The dealership was very 
friendly and offered that I take it 
home for the night to see if I enjoyed 
the SUV.  All around was one of the 
best experiences I ever had purchasing 
a new car.  And the plus was I got to 
save over $6,000."

when I saw the 2004 XL-7. Very nice 
updates to the interior. The leather 
seats are very comfortable and of good 
quality and Suzuki has done a nice job 
of moving the placement of the radio, 
A/C controls to give the inside a 
better look and feel to it. Fully 
loaded my cost was just under $26,000. 
$26,000 for a fully loaded 4WD SUV with 
heated leather seats, CD-changer, power 
sunroof, power windows and locks is a 
steal. Other SUV's with those features 
will cost you $10,000 more easily. At 
$26,000 you can't beat what you get 
from the XL-7. "
suzuki,xl-7,2004,Barney, 12/03/2003,My Experience in a Suzuki,4,"We as a family drive Saabs and we 
wanted to make sure we had a deep snow

several other vehicles we felt for the 
Money this was our best choice."
suzuki,xl-7,2004,SamuelB, 06/12/2005,Okay But Needs Improvement,3,"As midsize SUVs go the Suzuki XL7 is a bargain.  Mine stickered for almost $23,000 but with discounts got it for only $17K.  Considering you get automatic temperature control air conditioning, CD player, cruise control, and antilock brakes in the deal that's not too bad.  I've put 11,000 miles on it and have had no problems.  The build quality is quite good and the doors sound solid when you shut them.  The driving position is comfortable and it performs reasonably well except in high winds.  The gas mileage is much worse than I would have expected in a 6 cylinder midsize SUV, and the engine could use more power."

Great people no pressure agreed to 
terms quickly.  I disagree with the 
reviews comparing this vehcile to a 
honda CRV.  In my case I compared it to 
a Honda Pilot.    Very Close in almost 
ever catagory with the exception the 
Honda had a Power seat.  In the end I

bulletproof.  Very high reliability,

so I fitted the biggest Michelin tires

making the gearing ""taller"" by about 5%.

honored it and I got some fantastic 
financing and drove home with my new

happier."

no road noise, a killer stereo system, 
comfortable leather seats, a beautiful

suzuki,xl-7,2004,ShadowMan, 04/14/2004,Great SUV for the value!,5,"After having driven many midsize 
SUV's, it became very clear for the 
cost, warranty and standard equipment, 
this was the car.  You can pay 
thousands more and look no better than 
you will in this vehicle.  The vision 
or view of the road in the XL7 is very 
good.  The seating is firm, but very 
comfortable, especially on longer 
trips.  Power equipment and 
accessories are standard features.  
Handling, road noise and cabin comfort 
are as good as those costing thousands 
more.  Did I mention a great warranty?"
suzuki,xl-7,2004,John Lowe, 05/05/2004,My experience with my XL7,5,"The vehicle is peppy and fun to drive 
it turns well and handles like a sport

tough the transmission is smooth and 
quick.  Great car great price!   "

suzuki,xl-7,2004,underpaid, 05/24/2004,Out of 19 SUV's this is the one.,4,"After reviewing and test driving 19 
Midsize SUV's and owning Luxury SUV's 
for the last 5 years we can the 
conclusion the Suzuki is by far the 
best value in the market. Dimensions 
similar if not larger than Jeep's Grand 
Cherokee. Fuel economy at 22mpg hwy (24 
observed). Luxury features in the EX 
with a True 4wd system on a truck frame 
with a car like ride all for $25k 
LOADED make this one choice you must 
look into. Pound for pound or dollar 
for dollar you will not find another 
vehicle that comes close. Rear leg room 
is actually better than specifications 
show, nearly 40"" with a 5'10"" driver."

should have bought a car. "
suzuki,xl-7,2004,Dmurray, 06/08/2004,Amazing Value and Reliability,4,"Bought my first Suzuki 4X4 SUV in 1989 
and every few years, look at the 
marketplace to see if I can fine a 
better value coupled with reliabilty. I 
can't!! Drove my 2003 4X4 XL7 from 
Florida to Alaska, packed full of our 
stuff and pulling the biggest U-Haul 
trailer I could get. Flawless! Not a 
problem! Did the Alaska winter with 8 
Feet of snow. Again...perfect 
performance. Let the Hummer owners pay 
twice as much for half the reliabilty 
and performance. Idiots!! Lose your ego 
and go Suzuki. Wife drives the 2003 XL7 
and I drive a 1993 Sidekick 4X4. I 
guess I'm hooked. Money saved bought 
our Cessna!"

had eyes on the Highlander but for 
$5,000 less, beautiful cloth interior, 
(Highlander's cloth interior was cheap-
looking)nice, smooth, quiet test drive, 
I was very impressed with this SUV. I 
was also able to get the dealer to go 
with their listed internet price and 
purchased this SUV for less than it 
originally was listed for - it pays to 
do your homework.  If you want a nice, 
reliable, roomy SUV, test drive the XL-

smaller SUV that would hold seven. Not 
many choices on the market. Looked at 
the Escape and CRV. Dollar for dollar, 
glad I choose the XL-7 w/ the trird row

commented by others how great it looks. 
Love the drive as well as the mpg. No 
regrets and highly recomend. "

suzuki,xl-7,2004,CD Ottawa, Canada,Beautifully done for a cute ute,4,"Does everything well: handles, rides, 
easy to drive, hauls, pulls. Pricing is 
though to beat. Tried many others, but 
this one fitted like a glove. RPM too 
high at highway speed though engine is 
smooth and quiet. Good quality fabrics 
and plastics. Don't have 3rd row 
therefore 2nd row should slide rearward 
a bit more. A bit too thursty for a 
small V6. Hatchdoor swings on the wrong 
side, should have lift glass to 
compensate. GOOD ventilation. Truly 
civilized for an offroader. Not the 
vehicule your neighbours will apreciate 
but boy you sure will."
suzuki,xl-7,2004,beanezuelan, 09/20/2004,Alternative to Explorer & Highlander,4,"This is a great car for young families 
(w/kids 0 to five) that, for whatever 
reason, do not want to buy a minivan. 
I honestly believe that if you 
want/can compromise on a few features, 
it's a great value. When doing my 
research I was comparing this vehicle 
with Ford Explorer and Toyota 
Highlander. When you throw in all 
the features included in the XL-7's EX 
III package and compare with these 
other two, you are getting a lot more 
for your money. One item people asked 
me a lot about was engine hp, I find 
the 185 hp V6 engine is adequate. You 
have to realize that this car is about 
650 lbs lighter than a Ford Explorer 
Eddie Bauer, which comes w/std. 210 hp 
V6."
suzuki,xl-7,2004,malimida, 10/09/2004,My MIni Landcruiser,4,"I already own a Large SUV, but needed

I love this car, the price was right, 
it has the room for work materials

gets better mileage, it's sporty, has 
great interior features and looks like 
a Mini Toyota Landcruiser.  This is a 
cool SUV."
suzuki,xl-7,2004,Jay Sargeant, 10/11/2004,My XL7,4,"Years ago I owned a Geo Tracker which 
up to that time was the best vehicle I 
ever owned.  Of course it was a 
Suzuki.  I am pleased to say that I 
love this XL7, and though I've only had 
it a short time, I believe it will be a 
reliable, capable, and versatile car 
for years to come.  We love all the 
standard equipment for the price, it 
drives and handles very well, and I 
particularly like the body-on-frame 
construction as opposed to a car-based 
unibody.  I recommend this vehicle to 
everyone in the market for a small 
suv.  "
suzuki,xl-7,2004,Nick, 01/04/2005,Great SUV For The Price,4,"I bought my 2004 Suzuki XL-7 a year ago and 
absolutely love it.  Like others I 
looked at Toyotas but couldn't 
afford to get into the $30,000 range.  This XL-7 
has a car type ride and you can feel 
the road very well.  I must also say 
there is not much road or wind noise.  
Its interior is designed very well, 
although it could be a tad bigger, as 
sometimes you can feel squashed. I have 
had 3 SUV's, including a Toyota 4-Runner, 
and I would take the XL-7 over them any day.
I paid $19,200 for this vehicle with automatic 
climate control, heated mirrors, cruise, tilt, etc.  I 
suggest you drive one before settling 
on any other SUV."
suzuki,xl-7,2004,april, 08/06/2005,good for us,4,"We like our XL7, it's good for a small family, not really for seven grown ups. Other then that, I love it. it's got 4x4 and does have the extra seating if you need it. It's better for two adults and two kids, than anything else."
suzuki,xl-7,2004,CSI, 01/13/2006,One of a Kind - Fun to Drive,3,"I have ownedmy 2004 Suzuki XL-7 for eight months and have had problems with the rear end differential and CD changer and problems with the 4x4 disengaging.  Other than that, I really like driving it.  The 4x4 does not disengage properly when the tempurature outside is less than 30 degrees, which is not a good thing in Minnesota. I get 16 -19 mpg and the gas tank is too small, so I spend a lot of time at the gas station. The engine is underpowered for the vehicle."
suzuki,xl-7,2004,engtech, 01/02/2020,In tribute to my workhorse,5,"I usually just do reviews of newer cars or previous cars I've owned but I haven't really done one on the best car I ever owned, which is this 2004 Suzuki XL7. I bought it brand new in 2004 and thought paying $30,000 (after financing) was a lot for a vehicle back then, but it's more than paid for itself after 15 years of ownership and almost 280,000 miles later. The only major problems I've had with it are the power steering rack which developed leaks that I had to repair twice, rear wheel bearings which was a quick repair, and had to get the AC serviced.  I've done the oil changes myself for most of its life and even replaced the radiator myself, fairly simple jobs for a DIYer, I wouldn't let a dealership shop near it if at all possible. But it's still on its original engine and transmission, and I haven't changed the differential fluid since 100,000 miles because I thought it wouldn't last too much longer than that, but it's gone almost another 180,000 miles!  But alas it's getting tired and the engine valve covers and oil pan gaskets are now leaking, and there's a tiny exhaust leak. I just fill it with oil periodically and it's still going, and I suppose I can put in some money for it to replace all the gaskets, get the exhaust fixed as well as the alternator pulley which is starting to wobble, but not sure if it's worth extending the car anymore, as it's seemingly fulfilled its useful purpose being the family mover for 15 years, taking it cross-country many times in between, but now just put out to semi-pasture for short drives as a spare car.  If I can see a newer one with less mileage, I may consider it, or just put in the repairs to see if I can get it to 300,000 miles as it's oh so close. But it's been a great car, too bad they don't make them like this anymore, a true Suzuki vehicle before GM got involved in its redesign in 2005, so I would stick to 2000-2004 models if you're going to think about getting one used even if it has over 100,000 miles as long as it's well maintained, it's a great vehicle.

suzuki,xl-7,2005,studiocraft1, 06/24/2011,Flawless Reliability,4,"Bought this car w/25000 miles on it, it has been perfect.
I have Ex III model, all options ever made for this chassis.
4x4 is awesome, having the LOW range makes it a tru truck, that is why it rides a bit rough, don't care.
I get 20mpg in the city and about 23hiway.
How is that pooe mileage?
It does weigh 3700 lbs, I can tow my boat and quad, have no issue w/engine power, it is quick and responsive.
 Leather is nice, a bit cramped sometimes.
Now 78k, nothing done but tires, not even brakes!"
suzuki,xl-7,2005,Max, 04/05/2008,Great car for family and sports,4,"In 2005 we decided to buy the XL7 used, 6000 miles on it looking new and for a great price, way lower than a new one would've cost. It was a dealer's test drive car. Since we've got it nothing wrong happened. I have done the brakes on it at 30000  and costed $70.00 It gives average 18 to 22 MPG combined HWY and City. Regular gas is just fine. Very resistent, reliable and confortable.4WD is wonderfull when needed. Long trips are nice and smoth. The features from manufacture are great. My wife gets complements from all her friends, her car looks Young...they say. Very good car for the price. Low cost to keep mechanicaly. Looks better and runs better now that is paid for!"
suzuki,xl-7,2005,Paul, 02/06/2005,Solid Vehicle AND Value,4,"2003 LX_7 Limited 4x4.  Well constructed with thoughtfulness and care in detail execution.  Solid in feel, construction, handling and performance.  Well appointed and laid out interior.  No gizmos: everything you need is there where you need it ... and it all works!  Very smooth engine provides steady push rather than neck-snapping, wheel-spinning antics.  Smoothest automatic transmission I've ever experienced in a moderately priced vehicle.  2 to 4 wheel drive shift on the fly works impecibly.  Best truck-based mid-size SUV road handling in its class.  Great road handler as well as city parker.  Tremedous cargo and people volume, though more of one means you trade-off on one for the other. "
suzuki,xl-7,2005,Amrit, 04/30/2005,A reliable car,5,"The 2005 Suzuki Xl-7 has a more modern design than the 03 or older. One of the reasons that I bought this car was because I also own a Suzuki Aerio in which I did not have any problems. I bought the XL-7 because the price is so much cheaper than a lot of other suvs out there on the road. The woodgrain on the dashboard adds a nice touch to the interior which is standard on every XL- 7 model. The car is easy and fun to drive. The third row seating comes very handy. Suzuki's powertrain warranty (7 year/100,000 miles) makes you worry- free."
suzuki,xl-7,2005,psbassman, 05/13/2005,great suv,5,"this is the most overlooked vehicle, and I can't understand why. this thing goes and goes and only asks for gas and the regular oil change. I think it's the best looking SUV around. unlike other so-called suv's, this things a real truck, with a ladder frame to prove. tough as nails. yet a great ride, smooth and comfortable. i'm almost glad more people dont buy them, because mine stands out in a crowd of minivancarsuvs that would snap in half if driven the way this truck was built to drive."
suzuki,xl-7,2005,Harold Rood, 05/29/2005,Harold's XL&,4,"For the most part my ownership experience has been very positive. Second Suzuki that we have owned, had such good luck with first one that we went back for another. Folding 2nd row rear seats a little cumbersome and don't fold as flat as I would like. My vehicle does not have 3rd row seating, so I can't comment on those. Comfortable to drive and has relatively good performance."
suzuki,xl-7,2005,C Porter, 08/25/2005,Woman's view point,4,"I enjoy how it handles and the interior storage for five person seating.  I was very pleased with the space and comfort on long trips. The seats are firm, providing good support for the legs, seat and back on short as well as distance trips. I was pleased with braking in emergency conditions."
suzuki,xl-7,2005,Wanda, 05/24/2006,Good Family Vehicle,4,My XL-7 is a great family Vehicle.  It's small enough to park anywhere yet roomy enough to fit 7 comfortably with room for storage.  I highly recommend this inexpensive SUV for the price conscious consumer.  
suzuki,xl-7,2005,Jake, 06/02/2006,Flexible SUV for the Price,3,"This SUV can be found with lots of factory rebates if you're patient, resulting in a really good deal. It has lots of interior flexibility since the rear seats can move and be folded down for extra cargo space.  This is the only small-med size SUV I could find that had enough cargo room behind the second row seat to fit my two large dogs. Only a minivan could do the job better, and I needed 4WD. The only minivan with AWD anymore is the Toyota Sienna, which I plain couldn't afford."
suzuki,xl-7,2005,Don, 01/03/2005,Its fun to drive,4,"My 2005 Suzuki XL-7 is fun to drive. 
It has good handling in city traffic. 
The driver's seat is not made for long 
drives though. Wind noise over 65 MPH 
makes the radio useless. Also, they used 
too much cheap plastic in the interior. It has 
easy entry and I like the door handles, 
which work well. I like the looks of 
the vehicle too. The engine really makes 
noise (runs fast) when started in cold weather
and this continues until it is warmed up. 
I had this issue checked out and supposedly
that's the way the engine is on all models."
suzuki,xl-7,2005,luis, 01/19/2005,Very good SUV at a very affordable price,4,"I would recommend this SUV to anybody whos looking for Mid-size SUV at a very affordable price. I own a 2003 Limited with 45000 miles already and havent had a single problem with it. You get a lot of options that would cost you about an extra $10,000 in other models like the Toyota Highlander. There are some inconvenient, lack of room between benches, or a bit noisy once it passes the 50 miles per hou. The 185 HP is not enough either, but its performance in general is very good , considering that the price you pay is in the low 20s . This SUV  is been great off road or in the snow, as well as in very wet conditions. "
suzuki,xl-7,2005,US Family Robinson, 03/05/2005,Cool,4," We traded our truck, which was roomy, powerful, and comfy  for our xl-7.  The truck also stayed thirsty not to mention the warranty was long gone.    The Suzuki had all the things we were looking for and then some.  We went shopping on the basis of warranty and service foremost.  We tried the Kiabut the Suzuki won out with more room.  We also got the 3rd row seat.        The suzuki is just overloaded with options that came with it standard,  where others, these cost a consumer extra.      I agree that the seating in the XL-7 is cramped, but we knew this from the get go and we love that we can fold the seats down for cargo space.     Our XL-7 isn't very old but we love it."
suzuki,xl-7,2005,LuvItSUV, 03/19/2005,LOVE IT,5,"This vehicle is the best I have ever had.  I've had many other vehicles from various makes and models, but this by far is the BEST."

The vehicle as equipped, with everything is a great package.   The sound system is outstanding!  I particularly enjoy the heated leather seats.  A comparable mid-size competing SUV would have been considerably more expensive.  The XL-7 has sufficient power, but cannot compete with the 3.0 engines the competition offers.  This vehicle takes me where I want to go comfortably and with all the luxury of a more costly vehicle.  I'll forego the power for the luxury. "

suzuki,xl-7,2005,David Henry, 06/23/2006,Great Vehicle,4,"I love the Suzuki XL-7. It has a great deal of comfort and space. I can drive long distances and remain comfortable. The left side foot rest is great. The on dash controls make everything easy. The third row will definitely help you carry 7 passengers as long as they are not all adults.  The style and body shape are eye catching while the interior is equally exciting. So far my XL-7 has been very reliable and dependable. The engine power is adequate for towing. The pearl finish is beautiful, not quite white!  The interior has many compartments with easy access, and the rear hidden compartment is ideal with it's tray design. Overall I look forward to buying a Suzuki when and if I am ever ready to depart with the one I have. "
suzuki,xl-7,2005,just another guy, 07/05/2010,Worst car to buy,1,"I bought this car used with around 17,000 miles on it. It was basically new, it was the worst purchase of my life almost. So many little things go wrong with it. the most recent thing is the cable to pop the hood has broken. AGAIN. this is the second time ive been unable to open the hood. also one of the door ajar sensors is malfunctioning so everytime u hit a bump the interior lights flash on and it dings. gas mileage goes is awful. its' a ""compact"" SUV. its smaller than a mini van and gets worse gas than my truck. for a vehicle that size with a V6 and such little horsepower it should get way better gas mileage. the tire inflation sensor malfunctions too."

suzuki,xl-7,2005,Sara, 12/23/2005,Awesome Buy!,5,"I researched many midsized SUVs before choosing the Suzuki XL-7.  The selling point for me was all the options for the small price.  I would have easily paid at least $7,000 more for a Toyota Highlander or Honda Pilot.  We also have a '92 Suzuki Swift that has never given us any problems, so this was an easy decision for us.  I drove it in the rain for the first time yesterday and it handled quite well.  I didn't feel that safety in my previous car.  We are going to Lake Tahoe for Christmas and cannot wait to use the 4 wheel drive.  We have no problems manuvering this SUV in busy parking lots and tight spots. We are verrry satisfied with our new ""Zuke"""

I miss driving a car (pre- kids) and that is what I was hoping to buy. Unfortunately, at this time, that isn't practical. I need a vehicle large enough to cart my boys, their friends, sports equipment, and the dog around. I live in a remote area of NW New Jersey - it takes 20 minutes to get to the nearest grocery store - so I didn't want to buy a gas guzzling full size SUV. We have snowy winters and I love driving in the snow so 4x4 is required. The XL-7 was the answer. It provides all the features I need at a very reasonable price. It's fun to drive, good on gas, and the boys love the sound system.  So far, so good."
suzuki,xl-7,2005,gary wells, 02/17/2006,My Second XL-7,4,I love the fact that my XL-7 has a full frame and that the engine has plenty of power for the city and the highway.  The interior is very user friendly.  I love my 6 disc CD changer with subwoofer.  this truck has a large cargo area and the passenger seats can be made into a chaise lounge by removing the head rest and sliding the seat forward and reclining it back.
suzuki,xl-7,2005,paul rush, 03/19/2006,Into the Unknown,4,"We originally owned a 1995 Suzuki Wagon 4WD and liked it very much, with the exception of slightly uncomfortable seats. We now have an XL-7 with all the toys including steering wheel radio controls and heated leather seats. We are recieving 20 mpg out of its V6 engine. The '95 Suzuki would give us 23 mpg with a 4-cyl.

Having purchased many new vehicles in the past I started buying used, but I still had the itch for a new one.  I made a U-turn into a Suzuki dealer . My XL-7 is the best vehicle I've owned. I've seen my dealer for oil changes only, it hasn't had any problems or needed any adjustments. This vehicle is the very best buy for your money, period"
suzuki,xl-7,2005,Dazzling Dino Dannucci, 07/27/2020,Shiny Zuki,5,"I owned a 2004 Suzuki Aerio from new until 2013. It was the best car I've ever owned, just brakes tires and oil changes. I just bought a 2005 XL7 with 232,800kms on it and it's in exceptional condition for its age. I will be using it for winter's only. Has far as I know right now, it needs a balljoint, but everything works, I feel very confident driving it, and have no doubt it will last me a few years after rustproofing. My father has owned 3 grand Vitaras and they've been awesome. I wish they still made them in North America. If you are looking for a Suzuki? Buy one.

Tire sensors malfunction especially on cold days. Passenger door light is not working after several attempts to repair it. Security screen in rear is constantly breaking. Braking system needs much improvement. 
suzuki,xl-7,2005,eric , 05/23/2005,cheap interior,3,"My wife loves her's suv.  But, the interior is so cheap.  My wife bought the SUV while I was away in Iraq.  I would have spend the extra the money and bought a nicer SUV.      But, already we are having problems with the interior.  We had to call Suzuski for 3 months to get the tech to approve the work on the car.   finally the tech looked at the SUV to ok the interior.  So, we could have the car fix.  Yesterday, we found an problem with the interior."
suzuki,xl-7,2005,Samuel B, 05/29/2005,Good SUV But Needs Some Refinement,3,"As one previous reviewer noted, the Suzuki XL7 is one of the best kept secrets in SUVs.  I purchased mine fully loaded for almost $5K less than the sticker price.  It is a very comfortable car to drive and hasn't given me any problems yet, but the engine is only adequate and gas mileage is poor.  Some of the features on the XL7 leave a lot to be desired as well.  You need an engineering degree to figure out how to fold down the center seat, and the steering wheel mounted auio controls are so inconvenient that it's easier to reach over to the radio.  "

suzuki,xl-7,2005,salah el asmaay, 12/15/2004,Off-Roading Queen,5,"My experience with the 2005 Suzuki XL-7
has been positive since the start.  I was able 
to negotiate $4,500 of its MSRP which was already 
low, using a $2,000 suzuki rebate and a $2,000 down 
payment match from dealer. I paid only 
$20,450 for a 2005 LX-4WD 7 seats with an automatic
transmission. I was mainly interested in 
this truck because of to my loyality to its sport
bike line of products, which are the best in the 
industry.  I went on to discover that the quality
engineering and stylish design of Suzuki's bikes
carries over to its SUVs.  After folding the two back seats,
I had enough cargo space to move everything that I 
needed for my dorm room. This truck
Drives just like a luxury sedan with off-road capability."

options the more expensive models only 
have."
suzuki,xl-7,2006,Chuck, 08/17/2006,XL-7 5-Passenger,4,"I have had my 2006 XL-7 for a month now, it is one solid SUV. I took a trip to Key West with a family of four and was very comfortable. I was pleasantly surprized at how quiet it rides. The interior with the woodgrain makes it look more expensive than what it is. I bought the 5-passengers model because I liked and wanted all the storage space. It's amazing how much it will hold.  I have had numerous compliments on how nice it looks. I'm lovin' mine."
suzuki,xl-7,2006,xl7, 10/28/2005,First SUV,4,"I recently purchased my Suzuki XL-7 to pull my boat and move large items. I never owned an SUV before and was reluctant at first. However, after doing my research, I found the XL-7 to be the best buy on the market. It feels big yet is very responsive and easy to park in the city. It pulled my boat with plenty of power to spare. I love the fit and finish and it compared well to my Honda when it comes to quality and workmanship. I love the XL-7, it surpassed my expectations hands down."
suzuki,xl-7,2006,frank fiore, 03/06/2009,Quite good SUV,4,"Vehicle mostly used for short trips averaging under 10 miles (averaging 20 mpg) but around 26 mpg on the long range 65 mph or faster trips.  The car has excellent fit and finish, nice interior, decent sound system (car is intermediate (not premium) trim package but cloth seats are fairly comfortable. We have had no (none, nada!) maintenance problems.  Car was a rental for the first year of its life so we have been pleasantly surprised at its reliability since we bought it at 30000 miles. Excellent paint job, rubber door trim and doors close with a nice solid thump! V-6 engine very quiet once warmed up. "
suzuki,xl-7,2006,unsolctedadviz, 04/12/2012,Give it a chance! XL7 may work for you.,3,"We got a great deal on '06 XL7 in 2010 with 37K miles as a '00 200K Honda Odyssey replacement. Wanted another, but Toyotas/Hondas too pricey even with 100K. The XL7 sounds and drives like a truck--worse than a car or minivan.
Poor acceleration and gas mileage, averaging a paltry 17 city, 20 hwy. But so far, it has been bulletproof in terms of reliability at 72K miles.
No problems whatsoever.
With kids 11, 8, 7, we can still shoehorn 1-2 of them in the fold-down 3rd row.
Long trips we flip down 1 side of 3rd row and take plenty of luggage.
 Vehicle is horrible in snow.
2-whl drive was a big mistake.
Needs quality snow tires in winter.
Buy a 4x4. Missing minivan, but XL7 is next best.."
suzuki,xl-7,2006,Very Happy, 01/24/2010,Dependable,4,"We've had our fully loaded XL7 for a year and a half and only had to replace the alternator. It drives great, has plenty of power and handles well. I can't wait to try out the 4WD in the snow... We are a pretty tall family of four and room is sometimes an issue but having taken it on several long distance trips, it suits our needs well."
suzuki,xl-7,2006,David, 07/14/2016,Best $27K I've spent,5,"Bought our XL7 Premium 4x4 new in May of 2006 and still own it.  It now has 110k on the odometer and I'm here to tell you that it's the best car I've ever owned in regards to being problem free and reliable.  This beast has never failed me.  Other than regular maintenance items, a p/s pump is all I've replaced.  When shopping for a new car back in 2006, I did my homework and checked all the sources for reviews and buying advice.  I knew that I was buying an old school SUV with full frame and that it wasn't going to be cutting edge with stability control and other modern features at the time.  Even today, the switch gear and controls still feel like new.  No rattles or squeaks and everything still works perfectly.   It's a bit clumsy in terms of handling and ride quality, but that's expected in the design of an 11 year old SUV.   The fuel mileage could be a little better and in all honesty, Suzuki should have stuffed another 20 or so horsepower into this little 2.7 V6.  It's definitely a little hp deficient, especially if you live in the mountains like we do.  On a positive note, this thing will literally climb a tree in 4wd low range.  The winter traction is unbelievable.  In summary, I've raised both my kids in this vehicle and would do it all over again. I will truly mourn the day I look in the rear view mirror and see our Suzie being left behind for a new SUV.
***UPDATE***
Now 13 years old and 132k miles on the odometer.  ""Suzie"" has been semi-retired as an extra vehicle in the our family.  We bought a new Nissan Rogue Sport last year for my wife.  We were on the verge of trading in the Suzuki at the time but couldn't go through with it.  Brought the old girl back home with us.  The kids both came home for the holidays this year and we ended up using the XL-7 on a road trip to see family due to the additional seating it provides.  This old girl is more like a family member to us than a car at this point.  Long live my Suzie.
"
suzuki,xl-7,2006,Dave, 05/15/2006,Great Deal,4,"I bought my 7-passenger XL-7 a month ago and the only disappointments are the dumb reviews.  This truck is great, not cheap looking inside and has much better 3rd row seats than the RAV4.  I don't understand where these other reviews I've seen are coming from.  In all my research (and I did A LOT) I never came across anything about this vehicle being unreliable over the last 5 years, which is pretty darn good.  It usually does not have any defects or people complaining about how they had to get this or that fixed as in MOST other consumer reviews.  I mean give me a break, it's nice inside, the woodgrain looks expensive, and it is comfortable...but probably not for larger people.  I love mine, and I got it for a great price."

suzuki,xl-7,2006,binkys4deep, 06/01/2008,Not very pump friendly,2,"I'm not very in love with how fast the gas seems to go in my XL-7. And not only that, I had trouble with my air conditioning not even a whole year after buying it. My CD player is not working too well at this point. Things just seem to be going wrong while only having it less than two years  But at least most things are still under warranty. But who wants to have to get things worked on so soon? It served its purpose when I first got it, because I needed something that seated seven. And now that I don't need the space, I feel stuck because at this point, the car is only worth about half of what I still owe!"

I'm confused with the OD button on the side of my shifter. This was the last car on the lot that I saw but once I jumped in, I knew I wanted it. Not a big fan of the wood trim in the car, but it does have style and that's what grabbed my attention. The gas is gone quite fast, but overall I would definitely buy another one although I'm having so many issues with this one. It's very reliable, and I trust the strength having my kids inside. I have filled this truck up with lots of people and lots of boxes. "

Westbound through the northern U.S. states, return trip through Canadian soil.  The car was fun to drive, no back pain sitting and driving for 23 days.  With four adult passengers, loads of luggage and cooler being hooked up daily, the car didn't complain at all. This car has really exceeded my expectation by a mile."

Interior trim issue related to the 2nd passenger seat handle covers. Both sides came off and replaced under warranty. Carpeting in the third row seat area came off (kids inadvertently kicked them off). It turned out the carpet was not glued or fixed permanently but only inserted under the seat and held by Velcro fasteners. The third seats have been used quite frequently and are bearable for adults during short trips. Other than that the winter driving is super. In spite of 4 inches of snow, no need for winter tires as the 4WD system made the all-season tires still adequate. "
suzuki,xl-7,2006,Mike, 10/28/2005,Reliable All-rounde SUV,4,"The looks are a bit dated with the Vitara shape. The fuel tank is too small. It has good safety features and the 3rd row is a big bonus.  I was never a big fan of the 2001 model.  The 2003 shape, with the redesigned front and rear end looks great. The chrome side steps are an improvement over the plastic ones."
suzuki,xl-7,2006,sam, 08/31/2007,Nice family SUV,4,"I have used Toyota vehicles till now. We were reluctant to buy Suzuki. But when we compared Highlander to Suzuki, the price won and we decided to try Suzuki XL-7. XL-7 has still not disappointed us at all. It has been reliable, no troubles at all. So far satisfied with its performance. We used it to tow when we recently moved and it was great. Nice SUV."

Never gave me any problem from the day I took off the lot. Just oil change and regular maintenance. On 2015 the rust finally ate through most of the bottom exhaust, replaced it and 2017 the after market tail pipe again rusted and fell off. Following fall, the exhaust manifold finally cracked due to non other than rust. Then shortly after the crack, the rack and pinion started to leak power steering fluid. Served me well and didn't want to let go but I'm only allowed 2 parking spot on my condominium and other spot was occupied by a RV. Had Suzuki stayed in US market, I'd invest some $$$ to get the entire exhaust replaced and drive it another 17 years but lack of service and parts... To this day, I seldom look in used car mag for a nice decent shape XL-7 just knowing this SUV is one of a kind and nothing has come close to matching what it offered.

But this 2006 is the last import to Canada still made 100% in Japan. True the 2006 is less spacious than the 2007, but the 2006 seems to be built more solidly and has better standard features.  Just came back from 1000 km trip. The highway mileage was pretty good, better than expected considering still in break-in period.  We haven't used all seven seatings, but had six people several times and smallish adults in the third seat row had no complaints. "

It has a long list of standard features. Suzuki did not do a great job to advertising the XL-7. Some features were not even listed in their specifications. Many web sites have the wrong information too.  For example, the driver seat is 6-way power instead of 4-way power.  It has reading lights for the second row, not just the front row, etc. Our local dealer is very nice, and they have no-hassle pricing, which is far below invoice. I noticed small paint problem inside of the front window frame this morning. But overall the vehicle seems to be very well made. And I do not notice any cheap materials."

Suzuki really went all out with the gadgets: remote start; navigation; power seats; quality leather & materials; chrome wheels; even tossed in the free vehicle alarm and XM satellite radio!  Compared to a similarly equipped Murano the XL-7 is approx $10,000 less.  This is an extremely safe vehicle with side curtain airbags in all 3 rows.  Suzuki really got it right with the new XL-7."

We had a smaller car that just didn't seem very safe, so we decided to spring for a second SUV with a third row of seating.  We looked at Durangos, Chrysler Pacificas, etc... Nothing seemed as luxurious and spacious and priced right with high gas mileage, as the 2007 XL-7.  When I drove the XL-7 vs. the other vehicles, the visibility and control I had were awesome.

I went looking for a new vehicle and could not find anything as big with all the features for under $30,000.  I purchased the luxury model. It has three rows of seats, side airbags, all wheel drive, leather, heated front seats, and a DVD system for the kids. The DVD system plays MP3's, that's over 1000 songs per DVD. Also, it's a dual mode system.  That means that the kids can watch a movie and I can listen to my radio.  This truck's cons include the lack of heated mirrors.  My 2003 XL-7 had them and the Grand Vitara has them. This is a nice feature when driving.  Also, it has no Sirius radio, factory system has XM and no converter.  The only saving grace is a front auxiliary input. "

I already have 4,000 miles and have never encountered any problem.  In terms of safety, this SUV is deemed excellent as it is equipped with all available safety features.  The engine is very powerful with 253 hp coupled with variable valve timing, thus passing is very quick.  I purchased this car simply because of the engine, styling, and most importantly the affordable price. "

Just got rid of mine finally ('07 with 97k) white paint started peeling at 50k and found out it's a paint defect Suzuki will not fix. Then the turn signal stalk quit turning off and the speedo would show you going 140 mph when your only going 60 mph. Then the check engine light came on and found out the timing belt was needing replaced...3k later and about 8 months it came back on again same issue. Turns out it's a common issue in this engine along with sludge build up resulting in a need for a new engine....even though changed oil every 3000 miles. Again it's a design flaw that's common. STAY AWAY!!!! At all cost!!!

About October, 2010 the check engine light came on wanting the gas cap tightened which we decided to change thinking the cap was wore out.
It kept going off and coming back on.
In November, 2010 on a trip in the rain we experienced the traction and stability control shut off. Before it was said and done we had to have the timing gear and chain replaced and the steering and pinion rack.

The first impression I had was that I got a steal, nice SUV loaded with all the features at a low price.
All service was done at the dealer for the first 20,000 miles.
The inside looked nice, but was cheaply built.
Several plastic handles inside broke within a month.
The tires would never hold air, no matter what I did.
The check engine light came on at 40,000, indicating that the valves were sludged up and the engine would need replaced.

We needed 3rd row seating and compared it with the Ford Freestyle and Honda Pilot. We thought the ride was comparable to the Pilot, but the features, price and appearance were more attractive.

suzuki,xl-7,2007,doug, 07/16/2007,Great for the money,4,"This is an awesome vehicle if you don't need a ""T"", ""H"", or well-recognized brand on your hood.  Great features and terrific performance. We love the car. However, working with the dealership was horrible.    "
suzuki,xl-7,2007,shelton07, 12/31/2010,Bad engine,1,"When I first purchased this vehicle, I was in love with it. It had a lot of room and extra features and it did not cost a lot money.
However, after only 60,000 miles, I realized why it was so cheap. The engine light came on and when we took it to the Suzuki dealer they informed us that there was sludge in the engine because we had not changed the oil. I had them pull my account - since the oil had been changed at the dealer ever 3000 miles -they then informed us that the warranty was no longer good 60,543 miles! It ran out at 60,000. We had to spend over $3000 to have the engine rebuilt by a local garage. Suzuki said it would cost us $7000.
Do not buy this vehicle."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,MELISSA, 11/23/2006,So Far ILlove It!,5,"This car seems very well made. It handles extremely well. It is extremely comfortable. We have only had it for five days, but it has been pure enjoyment. I want to live in it!"
suzuki,xl-7,2007,S. White, 06/28/2008,Our 2007 XL7 AWD with Platinum Package,4,Solid comfortable ride city and highway. City gas mileage could be better. We average about 14 but that's at 25 to 35 mph and a lot of traffic lights. Drove from Louisville to Miami fully loaded and got around 23 to 24 at 75 to 80 mph. You can haul a lot of stuff in it. Small back window creates an adventure at times backing up. Vehicle is very peppy and the blizzard we had last winter did not phase the all wheel drive. The only problem so far was a brake light went out but the dealer replaced at no charge
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Jo, 01/21/2008,Good car,4,We liked our 2005 XL7 so much that when we decided to get a new car we got the same model in a newer year. We also got the limited package instead of the base model. I love this car. It is great for taking the kids on a trip or just going to the grocery store. I love having the ability to have as much room as I need. 
suzuki,xl-7,2007,BOBBY, 06/23/2009,We Love Our XL7 So Far,4,We just purchased this rig a few days ago with 33k. The first thing we did was take it on about a three hour trip. We love the roomy interior. Seats were pretty comfortable. I had plenty of leg and head room. The accellaration was great! Fuel econommy accoring to the onboard trip computer hit 26mpg on the freeway. Lots of cargo room. For the price we feel this is an excellent value. I see some people are whinning about cheap inerior panels. Sure they could be better. If you want better get off your wallet and buy a Caddillac or something. For the price we feel this rig is an excellent value. If we wanted nicer we would have spent more money. This has all the features and comfort we need.
suzuki,xl-7,2007,RB, 07/06/2009,GOOD RELIABLE RIDE,4,Purchased approximately 16 months ago. Have had no problems with vehicle.  Comfortable on long trips.  Rides more like a car than an SUV.  Much nicer looking ride and bigger than my Chevy Blazer.  Good gas mileage for vehicle size and type.  Very good handling in the wintertime over the West Virginia mountains.
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Dekker, 12/09/2009,Great used purchase,3,"I wouldn't be too impressed if i had purchased this new,however for a used vehicle its a great buy.The front (heated)seats are quite comfortable and ample leg room,I'm 6'1. Quick response from the engine and traction control can definitely be felt. Switching to manual shifting makes you realize where the extra horsepower is. Fog lights are a practical touch as well as a very functional roof rack. The dash just plain stinks, as others have mentioned a seam has appeared surrounding the passenger airbag, cheap plastic. I've gotten used to the location of the console window switches and actually prefer it, seriously. In summary recommend this vehicle only as a second hand purchase. p.s steering radius terrible"
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Rick, 08/28/2010,Very disappointed,3,"I this car for three year. I don't like the window controls because they are on the middle. Is very confusing and uncomfortable when you can't to open or close them. my dashboard cluster went dead the dealer did not covered it. the engine broke and the dealer did not cover the expense because I did not had the receipts for the oil change. I told them that I always had it changed when the computer signal that it was time to change it. I had to spend 3000 dollars to get it fixed out of the dealer. they wanted $6700.00 just for the engine, so they just call me to get it towed out of the dealer. I wouldn't recommended to any one this car. I still have 3 more years on the contract. "
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Nancy, 02/09/2008,Lovin' it,4,"I love the steering response but haven't enjoyed the lack of steering range. Takes a lot of room to turn, love the seat warmers, do not like the lack of visibility and do not like the location of the window buttons. But overall I feel really good in the vehicle, feel safe, feel comfortable. Was torn between the Berry and Gold, got the gold and think I would have liked the Berry better now."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,JP, 10/06/2007,Best Bang For My Buck,5,"I shopped, drove, and pretty much evaluated every mid size SUV under 30k MSRP I could get my hands on over a 2 day period. After sitting down and discussing what we liked and didn't like about each vehicle the XL7 came away the winner. The ride is smooth, it has good throttle response, steering and handling are impressive. I took it up into the mountains and had a ball with the manumatic shifter. Things like leather heated power seats, power sunroof, AWD, Auto Temp Controls, etc., were out of reach cost wise in other vehicles were within our budget with the XL7.  Smooth sporty body lines and a price in the low 20s sealed the deal for us. A 7yr-100k warranty, this one is a no brainer. "
suzuki,xl-7,2007,socalifguy, 12/01/2006,Warmed Over Chevy Equinox in Disguise!,1,"This SUV was bought by my wife, mostly by mistake, s she was interested in the Grand Vitara, and was talked into this piece of junk. It is without a doubt the worst vehicle I have ever owned or driven. Suzuki has some really great vehicles that they design and build, such as the Grand Vitara and new SX4. This ain't one of them!  We sold it at a loss a month after we bought it. The previous evaluation was undoubtedly written by a dealer employee or salesman. Rating it a 10! Give me a break. It gets lousy gas mileage and has a noisy / thrashy engine. Its fit and finish are the worst I've ever seen, mismatched plastic, flimsy trim falling off in your hand. This is a thinly disguised Chevy Equinox, which is rated very low!"
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Bob Miller, 10/05/2009,Will I ever learn??,3,"Purcheased an 07 AWD with 24K miles from an individual, next day the engine light was on. My auto tech son put on scanner and in 5 min said it had a bad catalytic converter. Vehicle still under warranty so took it to a dealer in Denver area next day. Their highly trained techs took two and a half hrs and diagnosed catalytic converter needed replaced. Ordered parts and need to go back to fix...sometime. Dealer rep had a real unpleasant attitude. Only experienced this once before, also with a GM product (03 Pontiac). Swore I would never buy another GM product...should have learned my lesson previouly and stayed away from GM related items also.  Will I ever learn???       "
suzuki,xl-7,2007,not happy, 06/30/2008,Hate this vehicle,2,"If you are stuck with one of these, be aware it has no value in a year's time. Terrible turning range, cramped cabin, very uncomfortable seats, they're too short for your legs, makes long trips tiring.  We have 2 children and the 3rd row seat really is a waste, because you need that room for storage. The dash quality is cheaply made and started puckering after 6 months.   After 2 days of this vehicle, we knew we'd made a mistake!"
suzuki,xl-7,2007,waxnmama, 09/13/2008,My purple Suzi rules!,4,"This vehicle is way more than beyond my expectations! I drove a Ford minivan before and my Suzuki XL7 is a dream! Suzi has so much power and great handling.I appreciate the luxury I have, for the amount the price. The value is fabulous. It feels so good to drive around in a car you feel safe in. I love this vehicle."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,can't believe it!!!!, 12/25/2007,I'm a believer! Love it!,5,"LOVE IT! I'm very picky with my cars and love german cars,  don't like japanese cars cause they feel flimsy. I'm very wrong, can't believe the XL7, it's wonderful, can't think of anything other than why is it not as famous as the others in its class, they need to do some more advertising, this is a great car that people should know about. It's a joy to drive, looks fantastic with the peace of mind of 100,000 miles! Suzuki has come a long way from the 80s and 90s. Just try it, you'll love it!  "
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Shane Hashmi, 10/31/2008,Love it,4,"This is our second XL7 since 2004, after upgrading our 2001 last year. Great exterior look. Interior design is great. Great handling. Great power. Smooth ride overall. We've been to 2 long drives with kids and both were very comfortable. We put the extra luggage on the roof rack. Good value for your buck."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,ron, 03/12/2009,Good Basic Vehicle,3,"well, going on 2 yrs and this has been a very good car for us, comfy on long trips to Montana from seattle and was even getting 27 mpg on that trip. Generally getting 19 around town. It has a large gas tank compared to most SUVs in its class even though I honestly wish it was a 20 gallon tank.  HUGE cargo capacity for this class of suv, you can really load it up. It's not top notch but we only paid $19 grand for it, Got around great in 6 inch snow and just cable chains on the front tires. We looked at trading it in but after looking at all the other SUVs, the fuel economy, and the cost of those SUVs we decided to just keep it. Unfortunately, this car really lost a lot of its value."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,jc2009, 04/30/2009,Really bad suspension noise,2,"I bought this XL7 brand new in August of 2007, it was back at the dealership on December for a loud noise coming from the front suspension whenever I turned or passed on a bump. It was there for about a month until finally they figured out what was wrong and fixed it. Now about 3 weeks ago the same noise came back, but guess what? The local dealership closed and now I have to drive about 4 hrs. to the nearest dealership because Suzuki wont allow me to take it anywhere else here locally. Stay away from SUZUKI, their customer service is horrible, they talk to you in a very unprofessional manner, and when you have a problem you are basically stuck with it.American cars are better..."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,CHERYLWILLIAMS, 01/17/2008,Proud to own,5,"I am extremely happy with my XL7. I traded in my 2004 Grand Vitara, as soon as the re-designed XL7 hit the showroom. I am in love with this vehicle! I get many compliments on the aerodynamic look of the vehicle! The handling is outstanding, gas mileage is better than the Grand Vitara, much more spacious than my husband's 2007 Honda Pilot (he's envious). Dashboard design is beautiful!! Suzuki  has a real showstopper here!!"
suzuki,xl-7,2007,duane, 01/22/2008,"""Best Buy"" in my book",5,"I was looking for a 3-row, FWD, V-6 suv and the XL-7 is THE best buy in the market.  I looked at all manufacturers, especially Japanese, and no one could come close to the value the XL-7 represents!"
suzuki,xl-7,2007,MELISSA, 06/15/2009,Disappointed,4,When I bought this in Nov 06 I loved it. I still love it but I am having problems when I start it and the check engine light is on. It is at the dealer now. They supposedly fixed it but it did the same thing the day after I got it back (1400 bucks later). I still love it very much and just want them to fix it. Starting to worry. Heard it has a GM motor.
suzuki,xl-7,2007,XL7, 06/20/2009,Poor choice,2, Had to sell at 24000 miles. Was using Quart of oil every thousand miles.Very expensive synthetic oil I might add. Lot of road rattles for a $30000 SUV. Poor gas mileage 13 city. Depreciated too much first 2 years. 2 accidents backing out of driveway because you can hardly see out the back.Dealer had in shop long time took the engine apart could not find the problem. Figure I would sell back to them out of frustration.Disapointing vehicle we planned to keep 7-10 years.
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Steve Heinz, 06/25/2009,XL7 the wander-er,4,"Attracted first by looks, then acceleraton, then sound system, then fit. 2wd w/traction control. Car has a tendency to wander almost as if each wheel at times has a different amount of power than the other. We drive it but not as often as we would like because. Dealer has no explanation. Seems better without traction control. Wouldn't buy another one if it had a hint of this behavior. Love my 92 Jeep and 95 Subuaru. Suzuki looks good in the driveway."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,rap808, 08/01/2009,great car,4,"I have bought this car in 2007. I fell in love with this car and still am. The price was good, and I also have 2 kids and they like to be in the back seat. I bought this car in case family comes to visit we can all go somewhere in one car. Oh and for the cargo it has quite a bit of room. The under storage that comes with the care all you have to do is just get like a screwdriver and look at the two screws. Once you take it out it has even more room and better. I love this car and wont get rid of it."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Upset in Florida, 08/06/2009,Airbag issues!,3,"I purchased my XL7 with approx 70 miles on it. First couple of months it was back at the dealers for repairs, spent more time there than with me. Then, going over a bridge and it sounded like a gun went off in the cab! The airbag on the passenger side went through the 1st stage of deployment in the dashboard. Took it in, no codes registered. However they did replaced the airbag and the dashboard. Now, here it is a few months later and it happened again! Same side.. first stage of deployment, no codes, but now Suzuki is saying.. sorry no codes.. it didn't happen.. I have the perforation mark in the dashboard from deployment! Everything is the same as the first time!"
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Outback, 09/06/2009,Suzuki? How about Yugo 45!!!!,1,"We were naive when we purchased the Suzuki. We liked the power and style. Then, just months later with 7,000 miles things started to go wrong. It started rattling, the suspension dilapidated, the car's computer died, the power steering died. Now in September 2009, it has 66,000 miles and looks and drives like its 20 years old. Now it is only worth $6,500 and we have become upside down on the car. Overall, I think this is the worst car in the world.  "
suzuki,xl-7,2007,More Disappointed, 09/11/2009,Mucho Disappointment,1,"My previous post ""Disappointed on 08/14/2007"" describes our early issues. Since then, catalytic convert changed, in shop 3-4 times because of engine shutting off in traffic, engine light on sporadically, engine stumbles sporadically, fuel gauge acting up, passenger dashboard airbag panel cracking. Everything in this vehicle is controlled by the computer, fuel, timing, transmission, etc. I have asked the dealer several times to please replace it. They ""Will not replace one unless a catastrophic failure occurs."" Overall hatred for this vehicle and frustration of trying to get it fixed has made ownership of another Suzuki product impossible. "
suzuki,xl-7,2007,jolbina, 09/14/2009,"Who needs turn signals, horn or stereo?",3,"Car horn stops working every time I go to car wash.  Stereo/DVD replaced twice first year and a half. When stereo/DVD goes, turn signals stop working. I drive from gas station to gas station. Gas mileage is probably worst in class.  Will stick with Nissans and Hondas in future."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,calibumpas, 10/28/2009,"Good Deal for the Money, Needs a Refresh",3,"Bought this to replace a '97 Grand Cherokee. Factors in decision were 5-star safety rating, usable third row, warranty, equipment, and price. I love the drivetrain (very responsive 3.6L and smooth 5-speed. AWD works seamlessly). After 30K miles it's getting 21MPG on average running Mobil Synth 0w-30 and Summer tires. Interior materials feel cheap to the touch and design is annoying in some important ways. A-pillars block vision around turns. I find my knee rubs on the console and my shoulder rubs on the b-pillar. Window switches are poorly-placed. Overhead console is garbage. Seats are comfortable enough but other factors distract me from a comfortable drive. You get what you pay for."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Katie, 11/06/2009,Love our Suzuki,4,"My husband and I travel for work and are in the car for hours at a time.  This is very comfortable on long trip and gets really good gas mileage.  (20/24)  We did have a few problems with the airbag sensor, but the dealership was great to work with and we have had no problems since then."

suzuki,xl-7,2007,ray , 05/15/2010,souring,3,"i got this car brand new. loved it then problems came. i had to have the transmission replaced before i hit 25,000 miles driving home form work and the car stops moving on the expressway in the first and second gear. sutton replace it. now the car jumps when you change from drive to reverse. they told me they couldnt do anything about that. now when you are slowing down and the car or suv gets to first it acts like you have a manual and you shifted down. still they dont know whats wrong and cant fix it. so i have soured on this car waiting dont really know what to do with it."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Pleased Owner, 08/30/2010,Great little SUV,4,"Bought this car new at the end of the model year and have been pleased with it in nearly every respect. The engine is fast revving and powerful, a real surprise the first time I hit passing gear, zips 15 - 20 mph quickly when passing from 65 or 70. I get 17 mpg in city and have averaged 24 - 28 mpg on the highway @ 75 mph. Turning radius is as good or better than other SUV I have owned. "

This is a great little car, but just seems to be a step below the Mazda in style and quality. If money is your number one concern, by all means this is the car for you.  You wont find another SUV with DVD, leather, 3rd row for this price. Believe me , I checked relentlessly, BUT I still wanna Mazda CX9! "
suzuki,xl-7,2007,ahs111, 02/02/2007,I'm in Love with My Car!,4,"After sliding off the freeway in my 2004 XL-7 during a bad winter storm (and then rolling and totaling it), I knew I wanted my replacement to still seat 7, but have front/all wheel drive instead, and side curtain airbags for all 3 rows.  Low and behold, I bought the 2007 model.  It is much improved over the old version.  I LOVE this car!  I've had it two months and have had opportunity to drive it on snow and ice.  It handles amazingly well in adverse conditions.  My gas mileage has been steadily climbing and at 2,000 miles it is already at 20 mpg.  The one downside: the stereo/DVD system stopped working and had to be replaced."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,dlane, 02/17/2007,Love It,5,"I did a thorough comparison of vehicles when shopping.  The XL-7 compares very well for the price with other vehicles in its class. The trim level I selected includes a DOHC/252HP V6 engine with DVD/Sat radio, leather and 7 passenger seating.  It is hard to find all this for the price that I paid in any other make/model.  this truck is very fun to drive and looks great too.  "
suzuki,xl-7,2007,William, 02/17/2007,"Second Suzuki, Better than My 2006",5,"I became a Suzuki fanatic when I bought my '06 Aerio.  It's little but has a powerful engine.  Now my wife drives a brand new XL-7.  It is roomy, handles like a fancy sedan, responds excellently and there's no way it compares to the Equinox. I tested both, the XL-7 has European window switches, a charger 4 manual speed, and most importantly my whole crew (3 kids), grandma, and grandpa fit comfortably in it. My salesperson provided outstanding customer service.  I paid under $23,000 for it. We are very happy with it.  We can't wait for the summer and drive it up to Yosemite. It;s too fancy for off road driving. "
suzuki,xl-7,2007,JAN SOUDIJN, 04/23/2007,Surprisingly Good,5,"The Suzuki XL7 is a fun crossover SUV to drive both on the interstate and in the mountains. Areas of future improvement should be the brakes, which require a significant amount of pressure, and rear view visibility is limited. Fuel economy on the highways has been fair at 24 mpg. After 3500 miles not a single problem. Good value for the money. If you do your own oil changes it is no fun to get the oil filter off since it is easier to take out an appendix."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,gc, 04/22/2007,Very happy - upgraded from 2004 Rodeo,4,"I really like this SUV.  VERY SAFE. Many safety features and strong crash test rating.  One of the best warranty programs available.  I upgraded from a 2004 Isuzu Rodeo (which I never had problem with) to the 2007 XL7.   I love the interior, very comfortable drive.  "
suzuki,xl-7,2007,jpgatorfan, 04/22/2007,Crossover or crossuvan,5,"A crossover for everyone in the family. For dad a sporty powerful suv. For mom versatility and room of a minivan. For the kids style with dvd & gaming input. For elderly parent easy of entry and exit (ladder not needed). We bought the limited w/dvd and everyone just loves it and after 12 years in a minivan, that's a lot for a crossover. If you are looking for a crossover or minivan, don't overlook the suzuki XL7 '07. Fit and finish was great on ours - 2 months and 3 thousand miles, 19.2 mpg."

Fuel usage is very good for an SUV, 24-26 on road, 21-22 city. Warranty 7 year standard 100,000 excellent, 3.6 V-6 outstanding. Standard options surpass all other brands. Safety is excellent. Tires, batteries for life is excellent."

suzuki,xl-7,2007,Nick, 10/09/2007,My new Suzuki XL7,5,"My wife and I just purchased this vehicle last week.  We looked at the Pilot, Santa Fe and Highlander.  In comparison to all four vehicles, the Suzuki has more leg room, bigger cargo space, more fuel efficient and better features.  If you are looking to place a child in the back seat, it is very child friendly.  Also, I am 6'1"" and I sat in back of all vehicles (all 3 touched my knees) and this had the most leg room.  We were searching for a vehicle with a lot of room for a reasonable price and this vehicle met our needs.  Look at all 4 vehicles for yourself and you will see the difference."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Duane Owen, 08/11/2007,XL7=New Word for Value,4,"In 34 years operating my own auto repair facility I have not seen such value in a vehicle before. The GM 3.6LY7 engine in the XL7 is awesome. Aluminum block, forged steel crankshaft, dual overhead cams, 4 valves per cylinder, variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust, roller finger rocker arms, piston cooling oil jets (to cool the engine with no coolant for up to 50 miles), steel timing chains (not belts). True dual exhausts. A 5 speed Aisin AF-33 direct drive cool operating transmission and Toyota T4 fluid. Loaded, quiet, and comfortable well below 30K. Drive one!!"
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Disappointed, 08/15/2007,Can I Change My Mind?,2,"The day after we brought it home we noticed fluid spots in the driveway. Under 3000 miles and the seals in the transfer case had to be replaced. The vehicle seems different now. At first we thought that we were experiencing road feedback because the vehicle feels like it's surging ever so slightly. But while on a smooth road recently, it felt like the transmission stumbled a couples times and then caught again because it pushed me back into the seat when it occured and it felt like a hard thunk. The vehicle is going back to the dealer for a look see but I doubt that they find anything. I also noticed today that a bolts holding the drivers door stop on are working themselves out. I want out!"
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Debbie, 09/12/2007,I love this SUV!,4,"I love almost everything about my XL7.  It's stylish and classy looking.  It has room for 7.  The interior is very comfortable, and the ride is great.  "
suzuki,xl-7,2007,thengkid, 05/21/2007,You Really Need to Drive This Vehicle,4,This is a excellent vehicle inside and out.  The engine is phenomenal and it drives like a luxury sedan.  Loaded up six adults (2 over 6' tall) w/child seat with ease.  Suzuki really hit this nail on the head.
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Norwinmom, 05/25/2007,07 XL7 Garnet Metallic,4,"I really enjoy this vehicle.  It's roomy, handles nicely and is unique and stylish.  I feel like I bought a luxury car without the luxury price.  Mine is the base model and does not have the 3rd row of seats, so I have loads of cargo room which is great for groceries, and the kid's sports gear or whatever else I need to haul.  It rides very nice, getting in and out is easy because it's not that high off the ground, but it's not too low either.  But when you're driving it, you feel like it's up a little higher than a car mostly because of the adjustable seat.  I'm short, so I have it the whole way up.  All in all, the more I drive it, the more I love it."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,RICHESTER, 06/25/2007,Happy with new XL7,4,"It took me lots of reading and thought to choose, but when all was said and done I am happy we bought this new XL7. My wife still has the older version which has proven to be extremely reliable and worth its own. The new one, side by side, shows a complete redesign. We have all the added safety features and third row (all worthwhile) and our children are fascinated with the DVD (it even comes with wireless headphones). Driving is fun, the leather interior is a big plus and the seat is wider than the old version. Seat belts are all 3 point and it has 8 airbags (6 side 2 front). The AWD and the automatic stability control do not affect the joy of driving it but it feels different than our old one."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,sidharth, 07/06/2007,A Great SUV for the price.,4,"I just bought the XL7 after a lot of research and going to toyota, honda and hyundai dealerships. The XL7 is very well priced SUV for 7 with nice features for price about 4-5k less than others and it really does have third row seats you can sit in. The other SUVs had them for the sake of just having them. Suzuki could have done better with interiors I think. There is a little engine noise while while taking off but on the whole it's value for the money I think. Took it on a long drive and it was clearly a winner. My advice test drive Pilot, Highlander, Santa Fe and XL7 before you buy one because it's only then you will know if you like it."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,hef1175, 07/27/2007,Suzuki XL-7,4,"This XL-7 is excellent in many categories. Engine horse power is outstanding. Safety features have the consumer in mind. Ride is quiet and comfortable. Standard equipment is perfect. Warranty fully meets the needs. Fuel economy is within most SUV's ratings, needs improvement."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Viacheslav Garmash, 10/30/2007,Fun SUV,4,"I've had this car for more than 6 months and am completely satisfied with it. It is roomy, powerful and fun to drive. Handles very easily; it's very fast. Great cargo space when 3rd row is folded. I am looking forward to testing the trailer hitch because one of reasons to buy this car was 3500 lb trailer towing ability.  We had couple very long trips in it and I can say this car is very comfortable. For example my wife and I drove from Grand Rapids, MI to Niagara Falls, NY. It took us about 12 hours to get there and in the end of the day we still had a lot of energy to walk around and enjoy the Niagara Falls.  I feel very confident when I drive this car in any season."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,tnt, 10/26/2007,Great CUV,5,This unit drives out great. More power than the Equinox and more cargo space. Not to mention the extra years on the warranty.  I think that GM did Suzuki a favor by putting the 3.6 in Xl7.
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Porter, 10/28/2007,Great car,5,This car is great bigger than toyota and all the others in its class great price and great looking A+ suzuki! Have put 1080 miles on it so far and loving every minute its a powerful engine and very comfortable.
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Daveyboy, 11/26/2007,More people should consider the XL7,5,"We bought an XL7 luxury package with a sunroof and 3rd row, and we LOVE it.  Two days after we bought it we we made a 6 or 7 hour trip to Virginia and the car performed great, we figured gas mileage wouldn't be too good since the car wasn't broken in but it got 23 mpg and was comfortable on the trip, with size and style and features and great price and warranty I have no idea why these aren't more popular, we are very pleased and look forward to many miles with our XL7. If you are considering Pilot, Highlander, or the like you should really shop at Suzuki as well."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Mommakell, 11/30/2007,I Love It!!!,5,"Previously I owned a Nissan Maxima and I swore that when I was ready to make another purchase it would be another Nissan.  Well a friend I work with bought a XL-7 and I drove it one day and I fell in love!  I am now the proud owner of my own XL-7 and I could not be more happy and proud.  I just took my grandson to Disney for his 3rd birthday, it was 2,000 miles round trip and it was reassuring to be in such a safe feeling and reliable vehicle."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Melissa, 03/31/2008,Too many trips to be repaired!,4,"We purchased our XL7 after reading and researching all the midsize SUV's. The honeymoon was over about 3,000 miles into it. We have had to take it back to the dealership 3 or 4 times because the ""motor mount"" kept causing problems with the ignition and thumping and knocking noises from the bottom. We also had trouble with a clicking sound in the odometer area. They told us at the dealership that it would resolve itself...not. Love the look of the car and would be 100% satisfied if we hadn't had to keep going back for repairs (the same thing each time) Seems like Suzuki didn't work out all the kinks on the 2007 XL7. We probably won't buy another, but what do you do? We'll keep it for now."
suzuki,xl-7,2007,hef1175, 04/07/2008,Excellent SUV,4,"I have owned Chevrolet, Ford, Mazda products liked all of them. After purchaing the Suzuki XL-7, I have decided this vehicle overall is the best vehicle. The XL-7 performance is oustanding, ride outstatnding, handling outstanding, safety outstanding,value far better than most products on the market. I have driven this vehicle in all types of climates and terrain it has performed above and beyond. The fuel economy 20 city/26 road needs inprovement.The 7year/100,000 warranty is great, tires batteries for life wonderful."

Has anyone else has such a minor incident and it has required your airbags to go off? My car didnt even go on the curve. Now I have to put in a claim at with my insurance company and Im not happy.

suzuki,xl-7,2007,Piece, 04/19/2008,Piece,2,"Just after 1000 miles the gear shifter wouldn't shift into drive.. it would pop out and shift into neutral. RCA Jack broke not even 200 miles later.. then the Radio went at 4000 miles it played when it wanted too. Then at 5000 miles the entertainment center went.. at 5500 the blinkers went. at 25,000 miles my leather is TERRIBLE. not good quality. Rarely have people in the car and it's ripped apart. WARNING"
suzuki,xl-7,2007,Leslie, 10/28/2017,Has been a nightmare,2,"This car, I purchased for my college daughter, one year ago, it has been nothing but problems. The two fans for cooling the engine, the fans won't come on to cool the engine, have had it repaired, new fans, new switch, etc., problem started again. The dashboard has lost all function of gauges, have no clue what has caused this issue. Paid 4500 for this car, in 2016. VERY DISAPPOINTED in this car.

 It drives beautifully, lots of power, is fast. i enjoy every little bit. i hope it stays in that way. i give 5 stars "
suzuki,xl-7,2008,tap17, 03/30/2015,2008 XL7,4,"I love this vehicle. I bought it with 35,000 miles in 2011.  It's been 3 years and 50,000 miles later and I still love it.

The body is holding up well (no rust, no peeling paint...still looks great!).   The engine is holding up well (no leaks, sounds good, etc.).   The interior leather, etc. is still in excellent condition.  

Overall, I have no complaints.  It's not a luxury make, but I didn't have to pay a luxury price. "
suzuki,xl-7,2008,K.M., 04/06/2016,I relate..Good&Bad.,3,"The bad-Reading through these reviews has opened my eyes to a few things..i tried opening my pass side door and found myself standing outside of the  vehicle holding the door handle in my hand,I see others have had the same thing happen and my locks can be tricky sometimes & now i realize the locks must not be great to begin with if its happening on other xl-7's...and my last complaint is the fenders i read others have had their fenders start to pull out of place which has happened on both front fenders of my Suzuki.
The good-
It has amazing space,3rd row. My kids can control their heat/air from the back seat & the vents are on the roof so they dnt play with them,they stay in the position i put them in. I like the rear wiper blade,nice to have in a 3d row to make it easier to see in snow/rain. There is a charger port in backseat as well,comes in handy for kids & their electronics. Alot of Space when putting dwn the seats. Back hatch opens very nice but i had one problem with it slowly shutting itself only happened one time. I bought my Suzuki used & over 5 yrs old but have read that even a few yrs newer have the same issues..Locks/Fenders/Door Handle/Sensors. So it must be a common problem and i wldnt purchase this vehicle for any more than half of the price its worth bc of the problems but i do recommend buying it if its at a low cost or reduced price,bc it seems to have no major issues and is a nice family vehicle when all the little things aren't going wrong. Thanks everyone Your reviews really helped me understand my vehicle & that im not at fault for those things.

suzuki,xl-7,2008,metrodesign, 12/24/2012,Excellent SUV,4,"This is a follow-up review I posted at 22,000 miles under the name ""Michael."" Now I have 64,000 miles on this vehicle and am just as impressed as I was back then. I have had almost no problems (still original brakes) and consider the performance superb. The best features are: acceleration, smooth power transfer, handling, stability and reliability. The only repairs I had was to replace the driver's door handle twice and replace the anti-sway bar bushing and links, but this is a small price to pay for an otherwise excellent vehicle. It needs quality tires like Goodyear CS Assurance TripleTred for good handling."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Tg, 03/03/2016,Super Suzuki,5,"No SUV with better interior space! Interior has held up very well! Nearly 200,000 miles and only basic maintenance!

suzuki,xl-7,2008,Tom LaBuff, 12/30/2015,XL-7: STILL much more than expected.,4,"I bought/ leased the XL-7 because it was a great deal and my friend recommended the car based on his positive experiences with an older model. When the lease was up, I purchased the car outright!  It has served me very well for over 11 years. Over the first 8 years there was only a minor glitch (timing chain kit needed replaced) which was taken care of by the warranty, and I had to replace the hatch supports. Just recently, however, I had to have the timing chain kit replaced again after only two years. No warranty coverage this time and it wasn't cheap. $2000!  Additionally, the wheel bearings on the front wheels also needed replacing. And the hatch struts had to be replaced again. I was not happy. Inferior replacement parts, perhaps? Other than that the car continues to be reliable. It seats seven adults, though the rear seat should be reserved for smaller folks or kids. I've had three teenage girls ride comfortably back there! It rides comfortably and fairly quietly; it has an extraordinary number of standard feature not usually found on a base model. And it can be used to haul a LOT of stuff if you choose to put all the seats down. The gas mileage is not great - 15-17 around town and 22-28 on the highway. But it has, otherwise been a low-maintenance vehicle. A great family car.
"
suzuki,xl-7,2008,rdparks, 07/14/2011,Great SUV for the money,4,"Bought this car used as an import from the States.
My wife insisted on a vehicle with leather, 7 seats and AWD.

The car has been completely problem free since we bought it over 2 years ago.
Oil changes cost a ton but are miles apart because it requires synthetic oil.
We have put over 50K (Miles not Kilometres) on the vehicle since we bought it.

It does lack sex appeal and the interior feels cheap. But after a bit we have become very comfortable with the car and are very happy

I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,SJT, 11/21/2007,A lot for the money,4,"I was looking for a midsize SUV for around 30k, and drove almost all the competition. When I saw the XL7 I figured let me take this for a ride, it really was not high on my list. But after looking at all the features you get for the money, it probably is the best value on the market. It has a solid but smooth ride, great pickup and has nice style both in and out.  It has one of the best warranties in the market, very little maintenance. It even has a timing chain, instead of a belt, so you don't have that periodic $500+ expense.  Although 7 passengers is a stretch, 5 or 6 can fit fine."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,volleyballmom, 01/06/2012,Not reliable,2,"I thought I had found the perfect car when I purchased my XL-7 three years ago.
I couldn't get rid of it fast enough after 30,000 miles.
The little things that should happen at 70,000 miles happen at 25,000 miles with this car. The paint peels, the locks break, the levers fall apart, lights and sensors come on.
The factory tires are aweful.
Not a good value."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,pat chambers, 09/06/2010,sun roof leak,4,this car is great but I would never ever buy another Suzuki because the sun roof leaks all the time and the interior is soaked with water coming in all the lights overhead.  Have had it to the dealer 5 times with no help.  I am totally disgusted and will never buy another Suzuki product.  I have talked to 8 other people with the same sun roof problem with no success.
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Bill, 09/07/2010,Having problems,3,"Purchased XL7 June 09 for $14K with 23K & now have less than 39K miles.  The vehicle is well maintained. So far, its been returned to dealer for repairs under warrenty to A/C not cooling & 2 door lock actuators not working.  The tires began to wear, so I paid for new tires & alignment in April 2010, which I thought was to soon.  On aug 15, 2010, I opened the back side door & the exterior door handle came off in my hand.  I drove to the nearest Suzuki dealer & was told that it was not under warrenty.  Called Suzuki of America & their Region Rep took a look at it & said that no ""goodwill"" would be provided.  Suzuki needs honor their vehicles quality & repair the door handle at no cost to me."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Jim, 07/01/2009,Love this Car!,4,"I have driven, for the past ten years Saabs, and before that, Mercedes.  When it was time to replace my 9 5 Saab station wagon, I looked around.  By chance I rented an XL7 for a weekend to haul some things, I fell in love with the car, smooth, powerful, compfortable, stylish, and well finished. Also, the price was great, with 4600 miles, paid 60% of list.  This is a great car, in a little over a month have put on 4,000 miles, and they have been much more enjoyable than in my Saab or Mercedes.  Great, great car!  "
suzuki,xl-7,2008,clmt, 07/14/2009,Love it!!!!!!!,5,I wanted to buy honda CRV until l test drive XL7 2008. I fell in love with it. The price was half CRV and has great warranty. I recommend it to all.
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Jennifer, 10/13/2009,Love my XL7!!,4,I knew I had to have the XL7 as soon as my husband and I test drove it!! I love the room it has inside.  The third row is so convenient. The storage is great and it rides really good. My daughter even loves it! Not too big and not too small. Perfect size for the three of us. Had no trouble out of it so far. I LOVE my XL7!
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Michael, 10/18/2009,This is an excellent SUV,4,"I purchased this vehicle with 9800 miles. It now has 22,000 miles after 7 months. My wife owns an RX 300 and I have had Saabs for 25 years. Previous to that I had a Corvette and Volvo and my most recent vehicle was a fully loaded Montana mini-van. I mention this in way of letting you know my past experience as a way of evaluating my judgment. This XL7 is a remarkable vehicle. It has performed flawlessly. Is is very fast because of the horsepower, torgue and perfect match to an excellent transmission. Braking is excellent. Road handling is superb. (My son had trouble keeping up with me in his Subaru WRX on a curvy road.) The XL7 wants to run at 80 mph, is very quiet and has a smooth ride. "
suzuki,xl-7,2008,lilly85, 01/30/2010,LOVE MY XL7!!!!,5,I bought my XL7 close to a year ago and its the best car that I have ever driven! I had a Jeep Grand Cherokee before this car so I wasn't sure how I was going to like the AWD compared to the 4 wheel drive but it handles really well. I have never worried about getting places and I've driven in pretty deep snow drifts. My husband has to keep reminding me about the speed limit because this car just wants to go! The ride is comfortable and my Grandma likes it because its easy for her to get in and out. I wish Suzuki would keep making these because I would buy this car over and over again!
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Tim, 04/24/2010,Surprised,4,"After test driving several vehicles, the Suzuki stuck in my mind better than any other.  The size, and agility were the most impressive. I have no problem downshifting to help pass on the highway. Around town is fun to drive too."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,hav, 09/11/2010,Likin' it so far...,4,"Bought it to tow a trailer from CA to SD in addition to the good cargo space. Did great.  Got 23-24 mpg with trailer.  Mileage is very responsive to speed. If you don't speed, the mileage increases, go figure! Car has been great for the couple months I've had it and made the long trip without a hitch(figuratively)."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,krjohnson, 07/03/2011,My worst purchase ever,2,"When I purchased this vehicle, I was not looking for an SUV. Due to the fact that there was a $5000 rebate, and I was promised by the dealership that ""they"" would furnish free tires for life as long as I owned the vehicle. Within the first two weeks of owning the car, the dealership closed, so all promises were off. At 55,000 miles, every light on the dash came on. The timing chain and a wheel barren had to be replaced. The lights continued to come on, they replaced a motor mount. There is an annoying constant noise in the steering, warranty does not cover this, and the front driver's side fender comes loose every time the car is driven. American Suzuki is not willing to buy the junk back."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,David, 01/21/2009,Yes a steal compared to the competition,4,"Best bang for the buck, looked at much smaller suv's with zero room behind the supposed 3rd row that's built for a dog or cat, oh and if your kids are in the third row and your hit from behind, good luck!  Anyway needed something that the kids or an adult could could actually sit comfortably and with room behind the third row for luggage, groceries, etc. This was it!  With the rebates and incentives they took 8k off sticker! You cannot buy anything like this at that price!"
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Maria Robinson, 06/26/2009,Excellent for the money,4,I love my Suzuki XL7. The only thing I do not like is that the rear visibility is poor. I had to purchase a rear camera after rear ending a my bicycle.
suzuki,xl-7,2008,DRS, 07/25/2010,Nightmare,3,Nightmare from day one! On the way home after purchase shimmy in the front brakes. Had to true rotors. Transfer case and left axle seals leaking. A/c quit had to replace havc head. Cd player quit had to replace radio/cd unit. Driver door was sticking had to adjust. Horn quit had to replace. Wipers quit had to replace wiper control. Had mold coming out of air vents had to replace evap coil in the a/c. Esp and traction control quit working had to replace hydraulic control unit. My just found new problem is my tire pressure monitoring system. My rf reads as my rr and vice versa. This is my story! I can't use the lemon law because they are all different problems! All these nice reviews. Why me?
suzuki,xl-7,2008,ckfranz84, 12/06/2011,Beware of Suzuki,2,"I did alot of research before purchasing a new car, and intially did not think about a Suzuki, but the dealer had this for a fantastic price with very little mileage. Since it was my first nice car I went for it, and was excited but now 2 years later I couldn't be more disappointed. In the past few month the paint has started to crack, and chip off in big chunks on the roof and hood, but Suzuki will not fix it because it is out of its 36000 mile warranty, even though it is obviously a manufacturer defect. I am very frustrated with Suzuki, and for this problem alone would not recommend buying from them."

Hopefully fix when warmer out. Heated seats work! Radio sounds ""tinny"".  I love driving this thing! I call it ""The Beast"". Worst thing about it is that it REALLY is hard to see out the back window!! Think I might get aftermarket rear camera for it.

I haven't had much time to drive it as it seems I'm busy 24/7 with my 2 jobs, but at least I got to take it about 60 miles outside of Denver the other day (and then back) and I'm very impressed with its ride/stability/performance and toys. With the navy blue paint and factory chrome wheels, I get plenty of compliments on my selection."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,RUBEN, 08/16/2008,Great price and fun to drive,4,I bought this car for my wife and I'm not dissapointed. The XL-7 looks great inside and out I would recommended  to family and friends planning to buy a great mid-size SUV!

suzuki,xl-7,2008,parkaholic, 12/08/2008,"""S"" is for super",4,Looked for a long time at SUV's and decided not to buy because of price. Saw the XL-7 in a parking lot and thought it looked cool. With incentives I got XL-7 for about $9K less tha a similarly equipped Toyota or Honda. I drove it cross country and averaged 24 mpg while traveling 75 mph. I have had no complaints with fit and trim although engine noise was present during break in. Only thing I would change is the power seats need to be eight way vs six.
suzuki,xl-7,2008,ed, 12/30/2008,Great bargain SUV,4,"Purchased a 2008 luxury trim model for the wife. So far, so good. She likes the comfy seats with heaters and the ride is smooth and car-like.

suzuki,xl-7,2008,Noah, 12/30/2008,Excellent choice,5,"I have been eying the XL7 for some time now. I owned an Aerio SX but I was hit by an elderly woman and it was totaled. I was in Japan for 3 years and all I saw was Suzuki cars every where. Hardly any Hondas. So when i got back to the States I went to the dealership offered $19000 and i drove it off the lot. I have no complaints, rides smooth and it looks good. I would call it a crossover before an SUV.   "

suzuki,xl-7,2008,Jeff, 02/04/2009,What A Change For The Better,4,"I just bought my 2008 XL7 2 weeks ago.  I had been drivng a pickup for the last serveral years.  I feel like I am in heaven now drive this new ride.  My wife has the SX4 Sport and we love it.  Now we have two Suzuki products and do not plan on getting any other for a very long time. Plus I got at a great price. From rebates and customer cash back I am paying less than I was on the truck.  And it turns heads.  I have had several people ask me about it. I even had a guy in his (Acura SUV)the other day tell me that it was a ""very sharp ride man"".  "
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Lewison, 02/17/2009,Would definitely buy it all over again!,5,"I upgraded from the Grand Vitara to the XL7 to accommodate our growing family and the extra space in the back is shockingly roomy! I can fit a large baby stroller, suitcases, and dogs all in the back together at once. My husband has even been impressed with the smooth car like ride and roominess. I love the acceleration too!  It's power is definitely understated since it moves much better than many other SUVs I've driven. "
suzuki,xl-7,2008,DEAN- LI, 03/02/2009,Great SUV,4,"Bought the vehicle used with 9K miles on it from the dealer. The car new was 30K and I paid half that. This is my 3rd Suzuki vehicle. Presently still has 2003 XL-7 with 96K(runs great). The car has fantasitc power, smooth tranny and is confortable to drive. The fact that the car is AWD is a big plus in the snow. Interior quality, fit and feel are just fine for me. I have pulled my boat with my 2003 XL7 without a problem and the extra 70+ HP will prove to be a great addition. 22MPG in the highway and about 18MPG around town. At this point I could not be happier."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Kris Hoepfner, 03/04/2009,Love it! (so far),4,"After looking at many, many choices for an SUV to replace our family Caravan, I had exhausted just about every option and was destined to pay 30K+ for an SUV that had all the options I wanted in a family transport. I happened to glimpse an XL7 while eating at a fast food place one day. I didn't even consider Suzuki as an option, but started doing some research and decided to chose something ""out of the box"". I have to say I've not been dissapointed. It's been a great SUV and was well within my budget with all the ""bells & whistles"" a much more expensive Acadia or GMC, Tahoe or Yukon would have been."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Janet, 03/15/2009,I love my XL7,4,"Suzuki performance quality, and reliability are hard to beat.  So much more comfortable than the Highlander or Pilot.  Wish it got better gas mileage, but it is a V-6 SUV afterall."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Paul, 03/16/2009,Why I bought one?,5,"I read all of the guru's comments as well as consumers.  Believe the CONSUMERS. I own BMW's, Hummers2's,Cadillacs,Corvettes and now a GREAT Suzuki XL7. While being a low cost vehicle I purchased one, and found it to be exciting to drive with 33mpg hwy first time driven with exciting performance! Comfortable ride,roomy,and one of the best buy vehicles in the market.  The warranty is second to none, and you will be pleased with the cost of purchase too! Sometimes the guru's compare to many cars to really understand what people are looking for. And try and compare apples and oranges.  BUY ONE"
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Cromag, 12/30/2007,Happy,5,"We had been looking for some time at what to buy, we had setled on a rendevoux, realized they discontinued, looked at the XL7 and drove it, bought it and wife and I love it. Black with leather, can always find something wrong with anything if ya look hard enough, but for the money, we are very happy."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,rap808, 03/29/2009,great ride,5,I love this car. The first time I seen it I had to have it. We had a Mitsubishi evo and I didn't like the no room in the car. But this car I have room a lot of room. I watch children and I can fit them in my car if I have to go anywhere. This is the best car for me and I love it. The space in the back of the third row can be roomy if you removed the cargo tray. It will be much deeper and give you quite more room. I have noth9 ing negative about this car. I will have it forever.
suzuki,xl-7,2008,TonyGee, 04/09/2009,Saved $10000 at Least!,4,"We had been looking at purchasing a car to replace an aging (84K) 2003 Cavalier. Our search took us into used car territory. It turns out that a company in Ohio, which leases these things to rental companies, was trimming the fat due to the economy. Our model had 10400 miles on it and was in service less than twelve months. We need this kind of room. Our other car is a KIA Spectra. Almost monthly, we are on the road to Nashville. Getting stuck in Atlanta traffic will almost be a pleasure. I am over six foot one, and my wife is five ten. There is so much room; and for the price and reliability this machine is unsurpassed. It's an even better deal at the price we paid!"
suzuki,xl-7,2008,BJM2009, 04/14/2009,Nice Ride!,5,"I bought my Suzuki with only 6,000 miles on it and love it so far (have only had it a couple of weeks). I had never looked at a Suzuki before let alone test drive one but once I did I knew it would be the perfect car for my family. It has everything that I want...heated seats...moonroof...and I especially love the jack for mu IPOD..there are a lot of vehicles out there that do not have this feature. I got a really good deal on mine, originally a $30k vehicle. I love the third row seats and the storage compartment in the back floor. The second row seat has plenty of legroom and the seats are raised so it's more comfortable for taller people like myself (5'10). I give this vehicle an A+!!"
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Jim, 05/12/2009,So Far So Good,4,"No problems with comfort, performance, reliability. Gas milage pretty good for a big SUV. Single CD player is quirky and will have to have it serviced(stops playing and cd won't eject). Purchased at dealer as an Executive use vechicle with 4,600 miles on it. Well kept by user. Overall is pleasant and comfortable to drive. Has good pickup when needed. I generally drive under speed limits on highways to save on gas. Good cargo space. No third row on this one. No complaints. I've owned Hyundai Sante Fe & Nissan Xterra and like this SUV better than both, although the Sante Fe is also a very good value for the price."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,PappyPwnerton, 05/18/2009,What a deal.,4,"I bought my XL7 in Dec 08 with 96 miles on it. For the money there is not a better deal. The motor has amazing power and it moves much quicker than you think. In upstate New York the AWD was a must with over 114"" of snow a year. I never managed to get it stuck. I never thought of buying a Suk, we where looking at Jeep Commander, after reading reviews I made much better choice. The 3.7 Liter in the Commander was way underpowered. I have 3 kids, its comfortable and fun to drive. I would have spent much more for a similiar SUV."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Retired2PA, 05/19/2009,Look out AWDs there's a new kid in town,4,"I was looking for an SUV/Cross Over that had lots of room, some bells & whistles, and a nice ride for a good price. After two months of looking I chose the Suzuki XL7. I found a used 2008 with just over 10,000 miles for under $16,000. It has good engine power, huge cargo capacity, and is a pleasure to drive. It has plenty of  amenities right down to the padded area below the ignition so your keys won't make noise as they hit the steering column. It's very comfortable and handles great. On a recent trip we averaged 26mpg with the air on for half the trip. We get 17mpg around town. The AWD will come in handy in the winter here in PA. Be sure to test drive one of these before you buy.    "
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Bob, 05/16/2009,Tickled with XL7,4,"Just bought mine used (6,000 Miles) from a major dealer. Great style, power and interior space. Love the fit and finish and bought it for 40% less than list at new. Great car for kids, w/side airbages and plenty of storage."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,teacher, 06/18/2009,Crossover to Susuki,4,Before I purchased my Susuki I drove a Lexus RX300. I could not afford to buy another Lexus but wanted all the bells and whistles of my Lexus. I would never thought to have even test drove a Susuki but when I did I was hooked. I knew that I was going to purchase the car. I have two kids and love the 3rd row seating. The storage is great.  It has a lot of pep and my husband likes the duel exhaust.  I really like the interior.  I love the red and white lights.  I actually like the window switches in the middle console.  I know some people in other reviews did not like that...to each their own.  I would at least recommend someone to test drive the Susuki XL7 before making a final purchase.
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Melinda McCullough, 06/30/2009,Gas drinker,2,"I have had this car for two weeks and I have put  $130.00 in it driving just in town which is an average of 24 Miles per day. It evaporates the gas, took it in to Suzuki and they found nothing wrong. Saw another Lady at church and she asked me if my car drank allot of gas.I said yes,it does she said hers does as well. Same model and year 08 XL7. Needs to be built fuel economic. Uses to much gas. "
suzuki,xl-7,2008,stacey, 07/17/2009,Waste of Money,2,This is the second Xl7 I have owned and I bought my current xl7 new in 2008. I have had it for a little over a year and it has been back to the dealership 7 times. There is something faulty with the gas cap and the check engine light will come on and stay on. To replace the air filter is $50 to replace the Hepa Filter is $72. The arm the helps fold the back seats down has come apart twice. Very dissappointed. I was going to trade it in and found out that the Kelly Blue book value is $9000 I paid $22000
suzuki,xl-7,2008,kgnsam, 08/26/2009,Value SUV and functional,4,"This is our first Suzuki purchase and have not been disappointed with it. It excels in room, power and functionality.  Too bad Suzuki dropped it from their line up, some upgrades to the interior and better tires (bridgestone - above average noise) can make this an A+ buy.  Looks good on the outside and comfortable interior. Rear seats are not for adults, but perfect for little ones, specially in seat restraint. Audio system is standard GM, very average.  Mileage has been around 22.4 hwy and 14 in the city. "
suzuki,xl-7,2008,bobbyjay, 09/04/2009,one of the best vehicles ever owned,5,"This is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned over my 50 years+ of driving  easy to drive very good petro mileage considering the size of the vehicle  the boot holds a great deal of luggage for holiday trips.  The instrument panel is very well laid out.  The bonnet has easy access.  The vehicle performed extremely well over our 4,600 mile trip.  I highly recommend this xl7  any gripes? yes; backing up the vehicle takes some getting used to. Really could use back-up sensors!"
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Frank, 09/08/2009,decent suv for the price,4,"I picked up a used 2008 xl7 with 28000 miles for about 14,500 reviews were ok so i decided to buy it. So far the suv is pretty good i have a little complaint about a noise when you turn and a couple of little stuff but not major. Finish on this vehicle is not the best everything is plastic and feels cheap. But on the bright side it rides very well decent fuel economy (24) on the highway and for the price you cant beat it. "
suzuki,xl-7,2008,EddysonBP, 10/19/2009,The real crossover for Suzuki,5,Stylish and drives like any other SUVs. Comfortable and reliable. I have been driving for a year now and never been tired or bored except of the air cutting thru.
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Laurie, 11/21/2009,Entire Engine Replacement- big HASSLE,3,"We had the car for 1.5 yrs when the engine light came on and it started making noises (less than 12,000 miles).  Already been at the Suz. dealership for 5 days for repairs and now they tell me it needs an entire engine replacement which will take another 7 days.  So- 12 days w/out a car.  Since it's under 36000 miles, they'll pay $30/day for rental car for 5 days only-- but that won't fit  my 3 carseats (that's why I bought the 7 seater XL7)-- and minivan rentals are over $100 per day.  Big HASSLE for single mom w/3 kids.  Wish I bought that Honda/Toyota minivan or SUV after all.   Already has some other minor issues previously."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Stephanie, 02/24/2008,I love my XL7,5,I have mainly owned Toyotas.  Prior to the XL7 I had a Sienna XLE.  I loved that van and didn't think I would ever want a different vehicle.  When I had the opportunity to drive the XL7 for several days I knew that was the SUV for me.  I haven't been disappointed yet!!
suzuki,xl-7,2008,westcoastcop, 03/11/2008,Suzuki hits a Home Run!,4,"We looked at the Mazda 9, very nice, looked at Honda Pilot/CRV and Toyota RAV and Highlander, and the Hyundai Santa Fe/Veracruz, nice also. But when you compare all of the features and standard stuff, the Suzuki really blows them away. Adding the no deductible, 7 year 100,000 mile warranty, free loan car, that covers exerything except the battery and tires! Even a burned out bulb is covered! Amazing. And the Japanese made GM motor is smooth and powerful, and all the safety stuff gets is a 5 star rating. "
suzuki,xl-7,2008,KAS, 03/30/2008,What a bargain,5,Bought this for my wife who really wanted a Toyota. However the best deal we could find on a similar Toyota was 10K more and they offered 4K less on the trade in. For $14k less I talked her into the Suzuki. I have owned many new cars of about every make and never had one that didn't have anything that needed to be corrected in the first few months. That is until the XL7 absolutly everything was perfect.  My wife loves the vehicle.
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Mark Johanson, 05/24/2008,Great 7 Seater Mid Size SUV,4,"A great value for a seven seater. The usable 2 extra back seats are great for kids yet even small adults. Plus the 2 extra seats have airbags so safety is considered (unlike other SUVs we compared) The inside design is basic and not all that stand-out yet functional. Has a very small front compartment which would be great if bigger. The back viewable area is poor due to the small windows, so I would highly recommend a back up camera system. The turning radius is large making it difficult to make tight turns like most SUVs. Safety features crash test rating are great as well as the warranty. This is probably the least expensive 7 seater mid-size SUV on the market and so far we love it."
suzuki,xl-7,2008,Thomas Beck, 07/12/2019,More Than Satisfied,5,"I’m a new driver and I needed a reliable SUV with AWD to be able to survive an upstate New York winter, since I attend college there, so me and my family did some searching around. We came across an ‘08 XL7 with about 130k miles on it going for $4,000 and were kinda doubtful because of the high mileage. But my dad took it for a test drive and it was, in his words, “the best car on the lot.” He bought it and I finally drove it the next month after arriving home for winter break (and even after a month of not doing much it still felt great). It was such a smooth ride and it was quieter than what I expected from a V6. Maintenance isn’t super expensive on it which is perfect for my family’s financial situation, and other than a faulty alarm system where my remotes won’t work even though the batteries and circuit boards inside are fine (I’m sure this is a problem exclusive to my car so don’t let this ruin your first impression), it’s perfect for a first car. If you see one, don’t pass up the chance to test drive it – or dare I say – to buy it.
"
suzuki,xl-7,2009,Adam, 03/22/2009,Why???,3,"I have a house in Colorado I use just about every long weekend or vacation I have. After years of renting a car and paying their fees, I decided to buy one. The idiot in me decided to buy a car over the internet and not test drive it. Unfortunately, it was the XL7. It had decent reviews online, a great warranty, it was cheap, and looked pretty good. But after 6,000, my thoughts have changed. The engine struggles around 65mph, and is full on panting at 70mph. The altitude may play a roll in this, but not that much. The car is put together well, but everything is a hard, hollow plastic. I get the MPG they say of around 17-19 Highway. Best Bet: if you are looking at a new car, get an Acadia"
suzuki,xl-7,2009,MMoylan, 03/15/2010,Safe!,4,"I've only had positive experiences with this vehicle. It had a good, higher powered engine that was fun to drive and could accelerate faster than most similarly priced SUVs. Very smooth ride and great traction even in snow. Felt like you were riding on a cloud!  Stood out on the road with its unique lights and grill, too. Gas mileage left a little to be desired though.  The main purpose of this review is to praise the safety of the vehicle though. The car was broadsided during a left turn directly in the drivers door by a sedan going over 50 mph. The side air bags and door impact frames absorbed the blow completely. We were thankfully able to walk away with no damage whatsoever."
suzuki,xl-7,2009,JBeninger, 08/23/2009,A lot of vehicle for the money,4,"I found this vehicle rides like a car and is very comfortable. I tow a 21'boat on a tandem trailer and love the self leveling shocks. The all wheel drive coupled with the manual shift feature covers a wide range of driving situations. The seven year 100,000 mile power train warranty provides long time peace of mind. The automatic ac works beautifully and was an extra not expected in a vehicle of this price. The ride and responsiveness is a joy and pleasure. One negative is the rear hatch visibility but I find the excellent side view mirrors make up for it."
suzuki,xl7,2001,pcabral, 07/05/2014,Suzuki XL-7 4X4 still running,5,"Aside from the breaks, exhaust, tires, tie rods,balljoints and wear and tear items this rig has pulled a 3000 lbs. boat w/trailer and transported our family around for 254000 with original transmission and rear end. The engine was replaced due to a mishap with the ""fast oil change place""not tightening down the oil plug, so My replacement engine has 50,000 less than the body and purrs like a cat.Self-adjusting timimg chain and all. Love this beast, and 22 mpg with 4x4 capable is an awesome value for reliable and capable travel. Keep an eye on the rust especially the frame and treat it early due to salt and sodium chloride on the roads . This rig is a one owner (16 years) and I don't look forward to getting rid of it. Tough to beat and grossly underrated.
"
suzuki,xl7,2001,srk2040, 02/20/2013,You can't find any other car for this price and performance during 2001.,4,"Had the car from dealer's lot brand new.
Few facts about this car:
1) the engine bay has a flex bar across it
2) the frame is liquid filled to reduce vibration
3) came with direct electronic ignition as opposed to plugs and wires.
4) has third row of seat.
5) OEM tires are exact same as Lexus RX300, Dueler HT.

The front brake wears out lot quicker than what I'm used to. Amazingly, the rear drum brake has never been changed and it always passes the inspection. It's on 170,000 mile now.

Comes with lot of upgrade if you really into it. I installed rear catch net, rear door net storage, window rain deflector.

Overall, you can not find any other car like this even today 2013 that is true 4x4"
suzuki,xl7,2001,Disappointed, 07/31/2009,Shotty Air Conditioner Over and Over,3,"I love my car, except that each year the air conditioner goes out.  This year I am told the cost is $1,000+ just for the part condenser or compressor??  And it had to have a dual air conditioner. :-( The car is probably not even worth that much. Too bad that the dealer were so bad on fixing this one problem.  Other than that, the car has been perfect.  Love the fact that the gasoline door is on the passenger side. It's fully loaded and got what I paid for . .no repairs other than regular maintenance-not bad for an 8yr old car. Body and interior in perfect condition still."
suzuki,xl7,2001,Jim, 07/07/2010,Handles like my sports car!,4,Bought this based on test drive and 3rd seat. First experience with 4WD. Had the over-size wheel/tire (option?). This XL-7 has been awesome. Dealer repairs VERY expensive. Driver seat back torn out due to years of toddler abuse (LoL). Car still drives like new. Fast steering - handles very similar to my Miata in fact - may give some used to the GM slush boxes some fun in the wind at highway speeds. Only problem was aluminum chips in early production A/C compressors caused a lot of failures in 01 02 XL-7s; and replacement / system flush averaged between $2000 and $2500 at the dealers.
suzuki,xl7,2001,grangt, 02/21/2002,Nice Truck/Terrible Manufacturer Support,3,"Dropped truck off on 01/30 for a 4-hour job. It's now 02/20 and still no truck because the shop can't get the parts delivered. Szuki has not established any method to get parts to shops quickly. Obviously, Suzuki is not interested in making sure their few customers are happy after purchase. Unless you have a fleet of cars for back-ups in case your Suzuki needs work, DO NOT buy one. Suzuki has a decent product, but needing transportation on a daily basis, will never purchase another Suzuki."
suzuki,xl7,2001,Skidney, 04/28/2006,Best Buy for the Money,4,"I bought this vehicle new in 2001 and I have had no problems with it.  It is the absolute best buy in the class.  It has real 4x4, 3,000 lbs. towing, dual A/C, and third row seating for the same price of a CR-V or a RAV4.  I have towed a 2,800 lb. camper with success (mountains were a little stressful)."
suzuki,xl7,2001,chris, 03/31/2006,Hate It,1,I can't stand my Suzuki XL-7.  I have had so many problems with it and the dealer refuses to fix any of them.  I wish that I never bought it.  I will never buy any other vehicle from Suzuki in my life and will tell all my friends not to either.

sales person.  Has been dead on 
reliable.  No rattles except the 
emergency kit under the back floor. MPG

Its comfortable on the road and plenty of room for 6. It can be towed 4 wheels down with ease. Its funny to see the surprize looks when leave people at a light after pushing the power button.  For the price you just can't beat it."
suzuki,xl7,2001,Euclid Oh, 01/02/2009,Best SUV for the Price,4,"We were looking for a midsized SUV to replace a Caravan. The Suzuki actually did better than we ever expected. The truck came with full power and rear AC as well as seats 7. The engine is very peppy for its engine size, but is kind of fuel thirsty. Ours now has 60k, but actually 48k. If you have a Suzuki, the trip odometer may not be accurate. Other than this, this was one of the best vehicle purchases that I made, in a list that includes Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar, and others that I have owned."

down, because no one could sit back 
there.  Excellent service on vehicle so 
far."

good gas mileage for a 7-seater. (21 
mile per gallon) 
The best part is the 0% interest on car

I purchased my XL7 in 2001 so here goes.
I would purchase another for the same
reasons. My four children and Spouse are
able to go anywhere the larger SUV's
tread, yet we find parking not a problem
due to the layout and size. Economy
could get a boost yet, I pulled a 2000lb
trailer with ease and yes, all four
children and Mom were present. If you
want a rugged and  refined SUV that
delivers towing capacity and looks great
at the theater which fits in a parking
lot, than go buy one. 0% financing was a
fabulous bonus. You won't regret passing
up the Blazer for it.
Ask for the Fuel warning light, I still
can't locate mine."

large enough to carry what I need, but 
not too large to make it hard to park

thousand it is a good deal.Only small 
details have been noticed. Such as the 
lack of useable arm rests,seeing and 
using the radio are not always easy. My 
husband is an aircraft enginieer. He on 
the other hand found other small 
problems that i never noticed. He 
advised me that the tires are shot 
after only 16000 miles. This is after 
two tire rotations. Also the defroster 
funtion is inadaqute when the vehicle 
is filled with passengers.Overall, 
Fully loaded four wheel drive still 
can't beat it for the price!"

suzuki,xl7,2001,tpiantedosi, 05/03/2005,can't wait til i get rid of it!!,2,I own a 2001 XL7.  I have had many problems from day one.  Within the 1st few weeks I had a transmition leak.  Which the dealer fixed.  After only 2 years and 24000 miles the tires were bald.  Though was told that it was not a suzuki problem.  (though it is known that the tires are horrible on the XL7).  I recently lost the gas door cover because the clamp inside rotted.  Though again not the dealers problem.  The 3rd row seat is unusable.  Children barely fit never mind and adult.  And the gas mileage is horrible.  The inside is cheap looking.  But it does have many cup holders and a light in the ashtray.  I would not recommend this SUV.  Instead get a Toyato Rav 4.  Had that before.

suzuki,xl7,2001,Linda F. Burgos, 10/22/2005,Reliable Suzuki XL-7,4,"My 2001 Suzuki XL-7 is a good vehicle for taking kids from Point A to Point B.  I have never had a single mechanical problem.  The four wheel drive is excellent.  And, I like the versatility of the third row seat.  However, better quality interior materials would be nice to consider as a future improvement.  My son frequently rested his feet on the rear passenger seat when he was a toddler so that the pocket on the back seat ripped open.  In my opinion, for a car that is marketed to moms with kids, the seat ripped a little too easily.  And, the plastic trim around the sunroof has an annoying habit of coming loose.  Despite these minor issues, it is a solid car."

The dash organization is poorly done.  The radio is on the bottom of the dash and hard to reach and see, which I think makes it a danger to change stations when driving.  As far as the driving of the vechicle, it's okay on a perfect day with NO wind.  With even the slightest wind, it's nearly impossible to handle, for male and especially female adults.  We've even been told we look like drunk drivers and believe me it's the car, not our skills. "

I keep running into owners with the same year and model and they're all boasting high mileage with little problems. 100,000 miles ago I had a problem with one side of the catalytic converter. The cost, $900, never got the other side done. Other repairs:power windows, a heating element, freon for the AC. I never had a tuneup, transmission flush, or any maintenance, just regular oil changes. The only thing I don't like is the 17/20/mpg cost because I drive an average of 20,000 miles a year, there is no icon that reminds you gas is low (ran out several times), and now a slow oil leak -2qts a month."
suzuki,xl7,2002,blahblah83, 07/06/2016,215k miles and still going strong!,4,"I have had my 2002 XL7 for nearly 10 years now. Second Owner. I have gone from 91k miles up to 215k and it's still running like a champ despite my lack of consistent maintenance. I've gone through all the normal stuff like tires, breaks, batteries, windshield wipers, headlights, oil changes and have very few complaints. 1 - not quite enough space for a rear-facing infant carrier. I have to pull up the passenger front seat to the point where only a small adult would be able to sit comfortably. I'm 5'7"" and can't sit as a passenger up front with a rear facing infant seat in the vehicle. 2 - I've got a bit of an oil leak and lose about 2 qts a month. 3 - my fuel economy has dropped to an average of 13-15 mpg regardless of city or highway miles. BUT THAT'S IT. Everything else about this vehicle has been amazing. It handles more like a car but after putting a tow hitch on myself (ridiculously super easy by the way to do so) I've been able to tow trailers and even drift boats without any issues. My XL7 handles well on both sand and even pebbly river banks (with a trailer even). It handles well in the snow and even ice, though I would suggest adding a few sandbags for extra weight when there is ice on the road for more than a day. It's a great height for transporting both kids and dogs as both can easily climb in and out on their own. There are child LATCHes which make it easy for child car-seats, booster-seats, and infant carriers to be snapped in and secured quickly. Overall, I have been thoroughly impressed and VERY PLEASED with my XL7. Like I said 215k miles and still going strong!

Snow, sleet, rain, high winds - no problem.

I never really thought I would like a utility vehicle but this one has surprised me. Corners well easy to handle and I can see out all around. Great little truck. I would highly recommend it to anyone that needs a 4X4 and it sports plenty of room and a third row seat for my grandchildren. My teenage daughter even likes to drive it. Very stylish looking and I would definitely buy another one.  Best vehicle I have ever owned and I have had quite a few. "
suzuki,xl7,2002,LadyDarya, 12/01/2009,Watch out for the air compressor,3,My advice is to do serious research on the XL-7.  The a/c compressor has a serious habit of freezing up and breaking the drive belt.  This is not a cheap fix.  I pulled the B04 relay and just went without the a/c.  Brakes are not that great and go out frequently and trying to find someone outside the dealership to work on it is not fun! Oh and the 2001 and 2002 models tend to loose their gas door (as in it comes off).
suzuki,xl7,2002,NioGio, 01/01/2007,Classy Little Ride,4,"Back in '96 I purchased a new Suzuki Tracker 4x4 convertible. It was probably the best all around vehicle I have ever owned...fun to drive, never got stuck ANYWHERE, stingy on the gas and an easy to maintain stylish interior(for the money). So in 2000, when Chevy introduced the Chevy Tracker 4dr 4x4...I just HAD to have it! It had an upgraded goodies package that raised the price to $21,000. I couldn't WAIT to turn that thing in when the lease was up, it was awful and nothing but problems! In 2005 I came across a used XL-7, took it for a test drive and fell in love all over again. It is everything I loved about the Sidekick in a bigger, beefier package! Sorry Chevy, but Suzuki wins this one hands down."
suzuki,xl7,2002,Shannon, 04/08/2007,Not terrible,3,"Good price for an SUV with third row seat which is WAY too small for frequent use.  My husband hates this car, but It never gave us a problem until the service engine light came on at 60k miles.  It turned out to be a bad O2 sensor for $250.  On maybe 5 different occasions, the belt squealed briefly when turning on the A/C then stopped.  I should have taken it to the shop immediately. At 100,000 miles, the A/C compressor locked up and caused the belt to break - a $1,400 repair in total. Fuel efficiency is horrible, avg 17-20 mpg.  "

She wanted something newer to drive. Second owner said just needed to pay for some medical expenses for his kid, reasonable, and said hadn't had it long. In love soon as I drove it, and had it almost 2 years. Have had brake problems, sticks in gear sometimes(5spd), and dies occasionally, but needs some maintenance to keep up when taxes come. 4x4 works amazing.

months, many trips to the dealer, hours 
of agony, and countless phone calls to 
Suzuki, I discovered that the exhaust 
system on the 2002 XL-7 was redesigned, 
and to repair my vehicle, I would need 
to replace the ENTIRE exhaust system, 
cost about $2000. To make it worse, 
Suzuki can't produce a tail pipe for a

never drive a car again!  Truck rides and drives GREAT!  I no longer get
tired on long trips!  Daughter loves the rear air, extra leg room, and reclining 
rear seats.  We didn't need third row seating, but had to buy that way to get 
rear air.  We removed third row seat cushion and that provided flat load floor. 
 Still needs cargo net to keep groceries from falling out on feet when rear

they use for the visors is too filmsy 
and not long enough to block the sun 
when you use it for side use. Overall 
this SUV is worth the price and has 
enough room to spare and using the 4 
Wheel drive is fun. Oh !! I do have one 
issue that I am too lazy to go to get 
fixed, is that sometimes the radio LEDS 
go dim in the daylight whichs makes it 
hard to see the station and clock. One

My XL-7 feels heavy but still it is still fun and sporty to drive.  It did really well at the off-road course I took last year.  The only problem I had was a coolant leak which may be the dealer's fault.  I recommend regular trans/diff fluid changes.  And the original tires are lousy, mine were bald at 15,000 miles.  Go with Yokohamas, mine are still like new after 30,000 miles.  I solved my oil filter access problem by cutting a hole at the wheel well and bolted on an aluminum sheet door.

since we have a small child), and a 
power lock switch on the passenger side

despite that it really only seats 
children or short adults! We got a good

expected and my kids love the DVD/TV 
screen and sunroof.  My wife loves the 
heated seats and the window locks.  The 
on demand 4X4 is so much better than 
all-wheel drive. The four-wheel drive 
goes into gear on the fly (like my 
Chevy) and we both feel much safer 
transporting the kids to school and 
back.  

I am extremely surprised how well in 
handles and the freeway and the perky 
engine.  So far we are very satified."

Downsizing from an Expedition, the size 
difference was our biggest adjustment,

this SUV."
suzuki,xl7,2002,Lorry, 11/19/2002,2002 Suzuki XL-7,4,"This vehicle is a fantastic SUV. Not 
only does she look sleek and classy. 
Her handling is excellent. Brakes are 
a little squashy but still are very 
good when stopping is a must. The back 
hach opening is a dream. Opening from 
the side instead of downward, is way 
better and convenient.
The 4wd in bad winter conditions has 
proven itself to me as the best i've 
seen yet in handling slushly, slippery 
roads. 
All in all it was thee best investment 
i've ever made!! Suzuki out did 
themselves with this SUV."

approximately 11,000 miles on it 
when we purchased it. It is extremely 
fun to drive, very economical and has 
presented few problems. There is a 
recurring ""rattle"" because the hood 
adjustment keeps getting loose and 
the front passenger seatbelt 
malfunctioned and was replaced, but 
other than that - no problems. It 
would be nice if Suzuki would make 
the seats a little more comfortable, 
too. It is easy to park, corners very 
well and is easy to control in windy, 
storm conditions. The moonroof 
opens easily for just a little 
ventilation, or for a more ""open-air"" 
experience. A very fun, reliable and 
economical vehicle overall."
suzuki,xl7,2002,Yokemate, 12/10/2002,"Quality, and much more than you pay for!",4,"The leather interior is polished and 
professional, the ride is quiet and 
refined, the seven year transferable 
no deductible power train warranty (3 
year bumper to bumper) is outstanding. 
You don't pay for a bunch of extra 
doodads. 
The XL-7 is two inches narrower than 
the ML 320, and is maneuverable, as a 
result. 
The XL-7 is truck based but rides like 
a car and has a part-time 4x4 
capacity, which can be switched to at 
up to 60 mph.
The XL-7 has done quite well in crash 
tests. The XL-7 has crunch zones, anti-
lock brakes, beams in the doors, 
pretensioners on the seat belts, and 
second generation air bags.
We've been surprised by the high 
initial quality."

travel on the national sea shore at 
south Texas.  We also like a vehicle 
that would take more than 5 people 
because our friends visit us very 
often. The XL-7 has been running on the 
sea shore with no problems. The 4-WD

very well on the muddy road and by the

for a growing family. I would like it a 
little wider but can live with it. 
However, I would not buy from Empire

several problems with their dealership

really should drive the XL-7, I 
reluctantly tried one...I loved it.  It 
was quieter, handled better and was 
more roomy than many of the bigger 
SUV's that I tried.  The AT shifts very 
smoothly, and it has just the right 
amount of bells and whistles.  Very 
solid vehicle.  This vehicle is 
deceptively quick and motors well at 
highway speeds and beyond."

weight.  It is very easy to park

mirrors.  Roomy enough for our 4 kids 
and they can handle flipping down a 
middle seat to get into the rear.  
Exceptional sound from the 4 speaker/1 
subwoofer CD player.  We added chrome 
nerfbars to help with the kids getting 
in and out and helps prevent door 
dings.  The driving lights really help 
in rain and foggy conditions and help 
shine where the headlights (very 
bright) can't.  Heated side-mirrors are 
a must.  With the rear air/heat vents, 
warming up and cooling down is done 
quickly.  Uses 5.8 quarts of oil."

The only problem I've had besides normal wear and tear was the ABS kicking in prematurely when I first bought it. Once the problem was fixed with my warranty the car has been nothing but awesome! The gas mileage is average, but the way the car handles and the fun I have driving it makes up for it. I was sad to find out I'd have to get rid of it, due to child #3 and no room, but I am trading it in for a newer XL-7 with a 3rd row seat. I have driven several SUVs, this has been the best by far! Love it on long trips, which are taken often. Anyone who has numerous problems must have a lemon and should give the XL-7 a second chance."

the fastest, most off-road worthy, get 
the best gas mileage, or draw the most 
looks but it has never let me down, 
even during -15 degree Colorado 
winters. You won't go wrong, but keep

don't expect one."

I drove it and liked it, but the dealership was asking too much.  So I found another one online, LOVED the color, test drove it in the snow and I had to have it.  I drive about 40 miles roundtrip to work each day and the gas isn't as bad as I had expected. It is very roomy inside and accommodates my 6'5"" fiancee.  I would definitly reccommend it to anyone."

The steering wheel has always made noise, and the air conditioner froze and leaked water all over the passenger at 5,000 miles,  All the other problems started at 15,000 miles.  I would not suggest buying this vehicle.  I have had it in the shop 1- 2 times a month.  I can't wait to get rid of it, and I will never buy another Suzuki.

work the 7-passenger seating mechanisms 
fine, and fight over doing so!  Seating 
is exceptionally comfortable for 4 
adults, and it works fine for 5-child

It is actually a lot better than in most reviews.  3rd row seat is a bit tight but you can move the 2nd row seat forward while 2nd row being not too crammed.  OK ride comfort but a little bumpy.  Braking even with ABS could be improved (when compared with a sedan).  I highly recommend the 2002 Touring model which comes with almost everything but alarm.  Get the rear cargo net option.

Gas mileage advertised at 18-20 mpg, but at less than 1,000 miles on the odometer we've been averaging 22 mpg driving city and mountain Haleakala National Park).  The 3rd row passenger seating was one of the selling points and though a bit tight, it's handy in a pinch (no pun intended) for carrying our visiting friends on Maui.

4wd on the other hand failed.
My mom complained about the 4wd for years and mechanics said thats just how suzuki 4wds work.
I finally brought it to the Suzuki dealership where they said the same thing. i asked them to just take a look.
Their senior mechanic said he has never seen a 4wd fall apart like that. He said it would cost at least $800 just to take it apart and see what is wrong. Only other complaint is that the belt they used is too skinny so it squeaks every morning if it is under 40 degrees.
If the 4wd still worked it would be a perfect car.

It proved itself this past week when I came across a flooded road going home one night going home from work.
It didn't look that deep but by the time I was half way thru the water was coming over the hood.
It never lost power or traction.
I passed a car stuck half way thru and the looks on their faces was priceless as they watched me drive (or possibly floating) by.
I was scared but the adrenalin rush when I made it to the end was priceless. Had a little water in the passenger floor board.

suzuki,xl7,2003,FAL, 09/15/2010,love my suzuki,4,"I bought my 2003 suzuki XL7 3years ago and I love it. It has gotten me through a really tough winter 2009 in MD. My only problem is that my CD player just stopped working my friend who also has the XL7 had the same problem with her CD player and a CD got stuck in hers. I was able to get my CD out but it just doesn't play at all. Other than that I love it, It has an automatic starter (not sure who added that but it is a plus) I would buy another one...but hope this one last a long time."

suzuki,xl7,2003,Luis A.Sara, 12/02/2002,GOOD CHOICE,3,"It's a good choice because cover my 
family needs. I don't like vans & mini 
vans and my wife use it to pick up & 
drop my kids to school. It has nice 
handling and very good engine. I like 
this SUV."
suzuki,xl7,2003,John Phythian, 12/23/2002,I like mine and I'm a big guy,5,"Love the acceleration, and smooth 
ride, 100x smoother that Jeeps & CRX, 
gets 25 mpg on the hiways at 90mph 
with no hesitation/""maxing out"". 
probably will do 120 mph if need to!  
Anyway, I feel very good about the 
price and performance.  Great sound 
system with cd and tape player."

suzuki,xl7,2003,mynewcar, 06/11/2003,3rd row seating,5,"I have found the third row of seating 
to be wonderfully handy for my kids and 
their friends.  Though it is not as 
easy to get in and out of as a minivans 
third row -- the kids don't care -- 
they love it!  I love the car and feel 
that it is a great value.  0% financing 
and full of standard options make it a 
great choice."
suzuki,xl7,2003,BobP, 06/12/2003,Very Good for the Money,4,"So far it has been a great SUV for me. 
It is the first I have owned. I looked 
at many others in this class and most 
were much more expensive, were less 
roomy, and the interior materials 
looked cheaper. The Suzuki was above 
average in all of these areas. The 
build quality is excellent. The engine 
and transmission are quiet and smooth. 
So far in mixed driving I am getting 
20mph. There is plenty of cargo space 
and comfort."
suzuki,xl7,2003,snjlovin2run, 07/25/2003,Great SUV at a great price,4,"In the XL7, I got the small SUV I 
wanted and we still have 7 seats for 
emergencies, although you do have to 
adjust the 2nd and 3rd row just right 
to make everyone comfy.The XL7 is on a 
sturdy truck frame and has a real and 
simple manual 4wd system.The engine is 
not a power dynamo but adequate and 
very smooth with the liquid filled 
engine mounts and 32 valve config.The 
engine using a timing chain instead of 
a belt also appealed to me. Gas mileage 
is better than expected, getting 22-23 
on the open road and 18-19 in city 
driving.It is simple and practicle in 
engineering and design but comes with a 
host of standard features. "
suzuki,xl7,2003,First Time Suzuki, 08/06/2003,Nice Vehicle for the price.,4,"I checked out a few SUV's including the 
Isuzu Trooper, Honda Pilot, Isuzu 
Rodeo, Toyota Highlander, Ford Escape 
and many others. I finally ended up 
with the XL-7 Limited. For the money, 
this SUV is great. The leather is 
supple, the front dash looks very nice. 
The wooden trims combined with chrome 
accents give the interior a very 
expensive look. I especially like the 
part where the front cup holders and 
space are completely covered with the 
same interior color plastic. The self 
illuminous dash light is very easy to 
read during the day or night. 
More engine power, power seats and 2'nd 
3'rd row shoulder to shoulder seating 
space need to be enhanced/added.  "
suzuki,xl7,2003,VABeloved, 08/20/2003,Most Features For Your Money,4,"I was pleasantly surprised with the XL-
7.  I was in the market for something 
bigger for my growing family (previous 
car 2000 Camry, another EXCELLENT 
car).  I was interested in 3rd row 
SUVs, but didn't think we could afford 
one.  Heard a radio ad for the XL-7 and 
decided to check it out even though I 
was not a big fan of Suzuki.  Was very 
surprised by the smooth ride (husband 
owns Isuzu Rodeo--ROUGH ride) and the 
luxurious look and feel of the interior 
and exterior.  Very well loaded for a 
total price of @ 22K.  Gas mileage 
(main concern for an SUV) is not as bad 
as you would expect either."
suzuki,xl7,2003,myn4now, 08/21/2003,The best unknown SUV - Mid range,4,"This vehicle is exceptional especially
trim and fit.  Power is in hurt 
considering it is a 6cy. but miles have 
been reasonably good.  comfort and 
luxury not expected.  overall great buy
and a real sleeper for under 30K it has
it all."

love having the third seat. we now have 
room for my kids friends and my kids 
love the rear air-conditioning, before 
they would be hot in the back while the 
grown-ups would be cool in the front. I 
feel like a million bucks when driving 
my sporty yet practical suv!!"
suzuki,xl7,2003,Captain Wade, 07/20/2003,Pearl White XL7 Limited,4,"With 5800 miles under my belt I have to 
say the XL7 is a great car. I have the 
Limited package that makes the car look 
like a $40K SUV. Everyone laughs when I 
tell them it's a Suzuki, they don't 
believe itme  Full leather, sun roof 
power everything. And the extra room 
the XL has is great. I just brought 
home two 60 inch beches for my boat. 
One in the cargo area and on on the 
roof with the optional racks attached. 
Let me see a RAV4 or even the new KIA 
pull that one off. And 7 seats to beet! 
The longer wheel base really helps the 
ride a well. Definately worth a second 
look.

Captain Wade"
suzuki,xl7,2003,Mr.XYZ, 07/30/2003,Gimme an import!,4,"This is the second SUV I have owned. I 
previously owned a Ford Escape. While 
the pickup and overall power were 
better in the Ford, it handled like a 
dump truck. I was afraid to take a turn 
for fear of turning over.

 I intensionally took sharp angled 
turns at above normal speeds during my 
test drive. The wheels were glued to 
the road. I never had the sensation 
of ""holding on for dear life"" while 
attacking the turns.

 I like the center console instead of 
the steering column gear shifter. The 
wood trim is a nice touch. It is also a 
sharp looking vehicle from the outside. 

Overall, a quality vehicle ot a 
reasonable price. "
suzuki,xl7,2003,malexa00, 08/12/2003,best kept secret,5,"Just purchased the XL-7 Touring model 
without the 3rd row seat. Very happy 
so far. Comes with a lot of standard 
features for the price paid.
The size of the XL-7 is somewhere 
between the compact SUV's (Rav-4, CRV) 
and the mid-large SUV's (Pilot, 
Explorer).
Fun to Drive.
If Suzuki came out with a full size 
SUV it would give the Explorer and 
Pilot a lot of competition."

mini-van previously but realized that I

and still is a 2001 Grand Vitara, for

were looking for another new vehicle

(without 3rd seat.) This car looks 
great (Pearl White) and rides as well. 
The interior leather is comfortable and 
the ""woodgrain"" interior looks rich. 
Great vehicle at a great price! Now if

It has performed flawlessly.it has REAL

defect I encountered was that the

other more well-known brand names, but 
I eventually decided to purchase a 
Suziki after my wife and I test drove 
it. The reasons that convince us to 
make the purchase are as follows:   1). 
The engine is significantly quiter than 
all other SUVs under 35K range we have 
test driven.   2). The road manner is 
smooth and comfortable, more car-
like.   3). The exterior and interior 
are satisfactorily decent.   4). Hard-
to-beat value for the price you pay.   
5). The size of the vehicle is just 
right for someone who is looking for an 
SUV that is not too compact neither too 
bulky."

known SUV like Nissan, 
Isuzu, Mitsubishi and others no 
so popular brands like Kia. Except the 
Isuzu(rodeo), all of them gave me a 
nice impression. After 2 months of 
testing My wife and 
I pick the Suzuki. It was the best 
value for the money; I like the ride, 
the power and the build quality. 
Really nice sound system also. The 
only reason why this 
car is cheaper than others is because 
of the name, Suzuki is not so popular. 
This car has better performance and 
offer more standard features for 
$10000 dollars less than the others. 
You cant go wrong with this car!"

I didn't know Suzuki had a larger sized

a customer vehicle!

The XL7 is a great value. I bought the

the Honda Pilot, Mitsubishi Montero,
Volvo XC-90, and the Infiniti QX-4. 
Aside from the XC-90 the Suzuki XL-7 is
technically comparable except for a few
minor conveniences.  Also in price the
XL-7 is practically half the price of
the XC-90 which was the biggest sellin

surprised that it offered the same
things as the Honda Pilot!  Plus, the
interior design is nicer, there's
standard wood trim, and the leather is
softer too.  185HP isn't a lot in the
midsize class, but if you need basic
transportation and don't need to tow 
you're absolutely fine.    We recently
took a 200 mile trip with our kids and a

have 12000 miles on it i'm very pleased 
with the suv and am thrilled to drive 
it on long road trips. i enjoy the 
roomness of the three rows of seat. i 
also like the idea of folding the seat 
down when i'm making a trip to be able 
to lay out fully in the back. i bring a 
blanket and pillow and take a nap will 
on the highway. i also love the rear 
a/c  that allows the passangers to 
conrtol how much a/c they want. i've 
taken several trip's from new orleans 
to nashville and dallas and have est. 
24 miles to the gallon. i researced 
this suv against outher's like the 
kia , hynudia,toyota and rear  a/c is 
optional ."
suzuki,xl7,2004,Trish, 07/05/2006,Durable but Needs to have a Better Ride,3,I enjoy driving my XL-7 around town but do not like taking it on long trips due to the rough ride. The ride is very bumpy and uncomfortable. I read that the '07 model will have a smoother ride. If that's the case I wouldn't hesitate to consider purchasing one. The price and warranty are good. Its reliability is good. I have not had any problems.
suzuki,xl7,2004,Rob and Family, 12/01/2004,NO Regrets,4,"Never considered a Suzuki until I test
drove a friend's. Couldn't believe the
ride & creature comforts. Suzuki bent
over backwards to to give the most for
your money. My wife & I were looking at
Rav 4 & Highlander but to get it equipped
the way the Suzuki was equipped would've
bumped the price well up into the mid
30's. The choice of Suzuki was a no brainer."
suzuki,xl7,2004,Ed Eskew, 04/21/2005,I Like My XL-7,4,"My 2004 Suzuki XL-7 has been a reliable and fun to drive truck. 3The 3rd row seats are not particularly roomy, but serve the purpose when we need to carry a few more kids. Its ride is a little harsh, but not jolting, and this is an ""SUV"". It handles and rides much better than most of the big truck-based SUVs I've driven. My milage was a little less than I had expected, but still better than most trucks. I suppose that the aerodynamics play a part in that."
suzuki,xl7,2004,bb, 01/06/2006,2004 XL-7,4,"We have owned our Suzuki XL-7 for 1 1/2 years.  The reason I bought it was the warranty, the design, and the trade in deal they gave me.  It feels very solid and handles well, I am 6 feet tall and there is a lot of headroom.  I think the XL-7 could be a bit longer, but it is adeqaute with smaller kids.  We have the 3rd row seat which is very tight.  If the SUV was a foot longer the 3rd row would be a bit more pratical. We bought out XL-7 with 6,000 miles on it for $20000, $15,000 with our trade.  The dealer gave me $5,000 for a 1994 Ford Explorer Limited with 99,000 miles on it.  My wife likes the size of the XL-7 and finds it easy to navigate.  She feels safe driving in snow with the 4WD."
suzuki,xl7,2004,grntd22, 08/10/2006,Check It Out,3,The Suzuki XL-7 is a great SUV.  It would be much better though if they offered more power and towing capacity. the 2.7 liter engine is too weak.
suzuki,xl7,2004,2004 Suzuki XL-7, 12/28/2004,Suzuki XL-7,4,"This vehicle needs a wider wheel base 
and extended flaps on visors to block 
drivers eyes from sun only. Everything 
else is great. Maybe a back door that 
opens away from curb rather then to the 
curb. The handling is sweet, likes its 
on clouds. The headlights are 
remarkably bright. No DVD player tho 
for the wife n kids??? Honda Odessy has 
one up on you. Ever consider getting 
rid of the ""7 passenger"" title to make 
more leg room and rear storage?? try 
it, you might be surprised."
suzuki,xl7,2004,Sherri, 08/10/2005,I love it!,4,"I love this SUV!  I've had it a year and I still enjoy it.  The only thing I dislike about it is the rear door.  If someone parks to close to you, you can't open it, as it swings out instead of up.  "
suzuki,xl7,2004,Lippy, 10/04/2004,Owning a XL 7,4,"I have had so many compliments on this 
Vehicle, hour nice looking it is how 
sharp it looks, the sound system, the 
price etc.
I thought driving a SUV would be like 
driving a bus, however it is easy to 
handle and has a smooth ride.
I am very happy with the vehicle."
suzuki,xl7,2004,j34half, 12/06/2003,suzuki xl7,4,"I love my XL 7!. It's a fun to drive 
vehicle.Contrary to the reviews ,I find 
that my XL 7 has infinite possibities 
for cargo and passengers. The third row 
seating converts in a second to flat 
storage after shopping and changes back 
to a bench just as quick for toting the 
kids carpool. Seriously, the 3rd row is 
cramped for adults but fine for 
children. It's compromise between 
storage and extra seating.This is my 
ninth new car purchase and by far, my 
favorite."

2003 xl-7 because of the 2000 rebate. 
with loan in hand at 4.89% and knowing 
we could get the 2003 model for 21,000 
after rebate on carsdirect.com. We went 
to Green Valley Ford Suzuki in 
Fairfield California(Bay Area).We got a 
2004 brand new for 20995 which is 
unheard of.  They also matched our loan 
and got it at 3.99%  Has all electric, 
cd with subwoofer and tweeters, rear 
air, seats 7 , mats, allow wheels, 
automatic w/overdrive, woodgrain 
interior, heated mirrors, keyless 
entry, and the 2004 models have a new

XL7 handles much better and fun to

suzuki,xl7,2004,G. Kimzey, 10/19/2003,XL7 Touring,4,"Excellent overall.  Good power and 
mileage.  We use it for touring, back 
road 4wd.  It is towed behind our 
motorhome.  Off road and on road, it is 
easy to handle. We are amazed at where 
we have taken it in 4wd.A truly great 
all round suv.  Will buy another when 
this one is several years old.  
Reliability is unsurpassed as is the 
quality.  An excellent buy."
suzuki,xl7,2004,Jeremy, 04/16/2005,You can not find a better value in a SUV,4,"I actually did not plan on buying this vehicle when I visited the dealership. I sat in one on the showroom floor and was amazed.  Our other vehicle is a 2003 Ford Explorer Limited and for a mere $9000 less the XL-7 blows it away.  The only option missing is power seats. Fuel economy is a little lower on the highway than rated but most of my travel is above 70 mph.  Overall it is a quiet smooth ride.  There are no options on the EX version, everything is standard."
suzuki,xl7,2004,blum1, 11/15/2003,Great Value,5,"I was all set to purchase a Honda Pilot 
when a friend recommened I take a look 
at the 2004 Suzuki XL-7 EXIII.  I took 
one out for a test drive could not 
believe the ride, handling, and good 
gas mileage.  The dealership was very 
friendly and offered that I take it 
home for the night to see if I enjoyed 
the SUV.  All around was one of the 
best experiences I ever had purchasing 
a new car.  And the plus was I got to 
save over $6,000."

suzuki,xl7,2004,xl7fan, 11/20/2003,Quite a bang for your buck,5,"I owned a 2001 XL-7 and traded it in 
when I saw the 2004 XL-7. Very nice 
updates to the interior. The leather 
seats are very comfortable and of good 
quality and Suzuki has done a nice job 
of moving the placement of the radio, 
A/C controls to give the inside a 
better look and feel to it. Fully 
loaded my cost was just under $26,000. 
$26,000 for a fully loaded 4WD SUV with 
heated leather seats, CD-changer, power 
sunroof, power windows and locks is a 
steal. Other SUV's with those features 
will cost you $10,000 more easily. At 
$26,000 you can't beat what you get 
from the XL-7. "
suzuki,xl7,2004,Barney, 12/03/2003,My Experience in a Suzuki,4,"We as a family drive Saabs and we 
wanted to make sure we had a deep snow 
vehicle. We were very impressed with 
the ride and handling after looking at 
several other vehicles we felt for the 
Money this was our best choice."
suzuki,xl7,2004,SamuelB, 06/12/2005,Okay But Needs Improvement,3,"As midsize SUVs go the Suzuki XL7 is a bargain.  Mine stickered for almost $23,000 but with discounts got it for only $17K.  Considering you get automatic temperature control air conditioning, CD player, cruise control, and antilock brakes in the deal that's not too bad.  I've put 11,000 miles on it and have had no problems.  The build quality is quite good and the doors sound solid when you shut them.  The driving position is comfortable and it performs reasonably well except in high winds.  The gas mileage is much worse than I would have expected in a 6 cylinder midsize SUV, and the engine could use more power."
suzuki,xl7,2004,matt67man, 12/12/2003,OUTSTANDING VALUE,5,"I Purchased my Suzuki at Al Packer 
Suzuki in West Palm Beach Florida.  
Great people no pressure agreed to 
terms quickly.  I disagree with the 
reviews comparing this vehcile to a 
honda CRV.  In my case I compared it to 
a Honda Pilot.    Very Close in almost 
ever catagory with the exception the 
Honda had a Power seat.  In the end I 
did not see where the Honda was worth 
$6000 more.  Would highly recomend this

suzuki,xl7,2004,Chad Underly, 12/29/2003,Most for my money,4,"I have not had to take my Suzuiki back
to the dealer since the day I drove it
off the lot.  I love the v-6 engine and
the ample cargo space.  My only regret
is not paying a little more for the
optional 3rd row seat and rear a/c...the
truck's standard a/c can barely keep up
on hot summer days."
suzuki,xl7,2004,sbehrman, 01/06/2004,Suzukis are bulletproof,4,"This is my fifth Suzuki.  They are 
bulletproof.  Very high reliability, 
conservative engineering, excellent fuel 
economy.  The XL-7 is geared a bit low, 
so I fitted the biggest Michelin tires 
that would fit in the wheel wells, 
making the gearing ""taller"" by about 5%. 
 The car still clims the 6% grade 
between 6000 and 7000 feet on the east 
side of Donner Pass in 5th gear.  "
suzuki,xl7,2004,Fleeto, 01/18/2004,Best SUV for the money,4,"The 04 XL7 is the best vehicle that I 
have ever purchased. I saw a loss-
leader ad in the newspaper  and 
decided to check it out.  The 04 XL7 
were on sale for 17,900.  The dealer 
honored it and I got some fantastic 
financing and drove home with my new 
car.  Since my insurance co considers 
a XL7 as a station wagon, my premium 
dropped by $400.  I couldn't be 
happier."
suzuki,xl7,2004,JOJOBALLS, 01/20/2004,Suzuki XL-7,4,"For the price this is a lot of truck.

children , this is the SUV for you. You 
can seat 2 adults and 5 kids in this 
one. The leather seats (ex III 2wd) are 
a breeze to clean. Gas mileage is 
reasonable compared to other 7

2003. The '99 was trouble free and 
very reliable and I have no reason to 
beleive that the 2004 will be any 
different. The ride is very quiet with 
no road noise, a killer stereo system, 
comfortable leather seats, a beautiful 
dash with wood grained accents and the 
feel is like I'm driving something 
much more expensive. I would highly 
recommend that anyone looking for a 
mid size suv to look at and test drive 
the Suzuki. I think that they will be 
pleasantly surprised at the amount of 
vehicle for the money. "

several times, it was so sharp 
looking.  Several months later my

this was the car.  You can pay 
thousands more and look no better than 
you will in this vehicle.  The vision 
or view of the road in the XL7 is very 
good.  The seating is firm, but very 
comfortable, especially on longer 
trips.  Power equipment and 
accessories are standard features.

Midsize SUV's and owning Luxury SUV's 
for the last 5 years we can the 
conclusion the Suzuki is by far the 
best value in the market. Dimensions 
similar if not larger than Jeep's Grand

observed). Luxury features in the EX 
with a True 4wd system on a truck frame 
with a car like ride all for $25k 
LOADED make this one choice you must 
look into. Pound for pound or dollar

can't!! Drove my 2003 4X4 XL7 from 
Florida to Alaska, packed full of our 
stuff and pulling the biggest U-Haul 
trailer I could get. Flawless! Not a 
problem! Did the Alaska winter with 8 
Feet of snow. Again...perfect 
performance. Let the Hummer owners pay 
twice as much for half the reliabilty

easy to drive, hauls, pulls. Pricing is 
though to beat. Tried many others, but 
this one fitted like a glove. RPM too 
high at highway speed though engine is 
smooth and quiet. Good quality fabrics 
and plastics. Don't have 3rd row 
therefore 2nd row should slide rearward 
a bit more. A bit too thursty for a 
small V6. Hatchdoor swings on the wrong 
side, should have lift glass to 
compensate. GOOD ventilation. Truly 
civilized for an offroader. Not the 
vehicule your neighbours will apreciate 
but boy you sure will."

(w/kids 0 to five) that, for whatever 
reason, do not want to buy a minivan. 
I honestly believe that if you 
want/can compromise on a few features, 
it's a great value. When doing my 
research I was comparing this vehicle 
with Ford Explorer and Toyota 
Highlander. When you throw in all 
the features included in the XL-7's EX 
III package and compare with these 
other two, you are getting a lot more 
for your money. One item people asked 
me a lot about was engine hp, I find 
the 185 hp V6 engine is adequate. You 
have to realize that this car is about 
650 lbs lighter than a Ford Explorer 
Eddie Bauer, which comes w/std. 210 hp 
V6."

Suzuki.  I am pleased to say that I 
love this XL7, and though I've only had 
it a short time, I believe it will be a 
reliable, capable, and versatile car 
for years to come.  We love all the 
standard equipment for the price, it 
drives and handles very well, and I 
particularly like the body-on-frame 
construction as opposed to a car-based 
unibody.  I recommend this vehicle to 
everyone in the market for a small 
suv.  "
suzuki,xl7,2004,Nick, 01/04/2005,Great SUV For The Price,4,"I bought my 2004 Suzuki XL-7 a year ago and 
absolutely love it.  Like others I 
looked at Toyotas but couldn't 
afford to get into the $30,000 range.  This XL-7 
has a car type ride and you can feel 
the road very well.  I must also say 
there is not much road or wind noise.  
Its interior is designed very well, 
although it could be a tad bigger, as 
sometimes you can feel squashed. I have 
had 3 SUV's, including a Toyota 4-Runner, 
and I would take the XL-7 over them any day.
I paid $19,200 for this vehicle with automatic 
climate control, heated mirrors, cruise, tilt, etc.  I 
suggest you drive one before settling

suzuki,xl7,2004,april, 08/06/2005,good for us,4,"We like our XL7, it's good for a small family, not really for seven grown ups. Other then that, I love it. it's got 4x4 and does have the extra seating if you need it. It's better for two adults and two kids, than anything else."
suzuki,xl7,2004,CSI, 01/13/2006,One of a Kind - Fun to Drive,3,"I have ownedmy 2004 Suzuki XL-7 for eight months and have had problems with the rear end differential and CD changer and problems with the 4x4 disengaging.  Other than that, I really like driving it.  The 4x4 does not disengage properly when the tempurature outside is less than 30 degrees, which is not a good thing in Minnesota. I get 16 -19 mpg and the gas tank is too small, so I spend a lot of time at the gas station. The engine is underpowered for the vehicle."
suzuki,xl7,2004,engtech, 01/02/2020,In tribute to my workhorse,5,"I usually just do reviews of newer cars or previous cars I've owned but I haven't really done one on the best car I ever owned, which is this 2004 Suzuki XL7. I bought it brand new in 2004 and thought paying $30,000 (after financing) was a lot for a vehicle back then, but it's more than paid for itself after 15 years of ownership and almost 280,000 miles later. The only major problems I've had with it are the power steering rack which developed leaks that I had to repair twice, rear wheel bearings which was a quick repair, and had to get the AC serviced.  I've done the oil changes myself for most of its life and even replaced the radiator myself, fairly simple jobs for a DIYer, I wouldn't let a dealership shop near it if at all possible. But it's still on its original engine and transmission, and I haven't changed the differential fluid since 100,000 miles because I thought it wouldn't last too much longer than that, but it's gone almost another 180,000 miles!  But alas it's getting tired and the engine valve covers and oil pan gaskets are now leaking, and there's a tiny exhaust leak. I just fill it with oil periodically and it's still going, and I suppose I can put in some money for it to replace all the gaskets, get the exhaust fixed as well as the alternator pulley which is starting to wobble, but not sure if it's worth extending the car anymore, as it's seemingly fulfilled its useful purpose being the family mover for 15 years, taking it cross-country many times in between, but now just put out to semi-pasture for short drives as a spare car.  If I can see a newer one with less mileage, I may consider it, or just put in the repairs to see if I can get it to 300,000 miles as it's oh so close. But it's been a great car, too bad they don't make them like this anymore, a true Suzuki vehicle before GM got involved in its redesign in 2005, so I would stick to 2000-2004 models if you're going to think about getting one used even if it has over 100,000 miles as long as it's well maintained, it's a great vehicle.

I have Ex III model, all options ever made for this chassis.
4x4 is awesome, having the LOW range makes it a tru truck, that is why it rides a bit rough, don't care.
I get 20mpg in the city and about 23hiway.
How is that pooe mileage?
It does weigh 3700 lbs, I can tow my boat and quad, have no issue w/engine power, it is quick and responsive.
 Leather is nice, a bit cramped sometimes.
Now 78k, nothing done but tires, not even brakes!"
suzuki,xl7,2005,Max, 04/05/2008,Great car for family and sports,4,"In 2005 we decided to buy the XL7 used, 6000 miles on it looking new and for a great price, way lower than a new one would've cost. It was a dealer's test drive car. Since we've got it nothing wrong happened. I have done the brakes on it at 30000  and costed $70.00 It gives average 18 to 22 MPG combined HWY and City. Regular gas is just fine. Very resistent, reliable and confortable.4WD is wonderfull when needed. Long trips are nice and smoth. The features from manufacture are great. My wife gets complements from all her friends, her car looks Young...they say. Very good car for the price. Low cost to keep mechanicaly. Looks better and runs better now that is paid for!"

Solid in feel, construction, handling and performance.  Well appointed and laid out interior.  No gizmos: everything you need is there where you need it ... and it all works!  Very smooth engine provides steady push rather than neck-snapping, wheel-spinning antics.  Smoothest automatic transmission I've ever experienced in a moderately priced vehicle.  2 to 4 wheel drive shift on the fly works impecibly.  Best truck-based mid-size SUV road handling in its class.  Great road handler as well as city parker.  Tremedous cargo and people volume, though more of one means you trade-off on one for the other.

suzuki,xl7,2005,Amrit, 04/30/2005,A reliable car,5,"The 2005 Suzuki Xl-7 has a more modern design than the 03 or older. One of the reasons that I bought this car was because I also own a Suzuki Aerio in which I did not have any problems. I bought the XL-7 because the price is so much cheaper than a lot of other suvs out there on the road. The woodgrain on the dashboard adds a nice touch to the interior which is standard on every XL- 7 model. The car is easy and fun to drive. The third row seating comes very handy. Suzuki's powertrain warranty (7 year/100,000 miles) makes you worry- free."
suzuki,xl7,2005,psbassman, 05/13/2005,great suv,5,"this is the most overlooked vehicle, and I can't understand why. this thing goes and goes and only asks for gas and the regular oil change. I think it's the best looking SUV around. unlike other so-called suv's, this things a real truck, with a ladder frame to prove. tough as nails. yet a great ride, smooth and comfortable. i'm almost glad more people dont buy them, because mine stands out in a crowd of minivancarsuvs that would snap in half if driven the way this truck was built to drive."
suzuki,xl7,2005,Harold Rood, 05/29/2005,Harold's XL&,4,"For the most part my ownership experience has been very positive. Second Suzuki that we have owned, had such good luck with first one that we went back for another. Folding 2nd row rear seats a little cumbersome and don't fold as flat as I would like. My vehicle does not have 3rd row seating, so I can't comment on those. Comfortable to drive and has relatively good performance."
suzuki,xl7,2005,C Porter, 08/25/2005,Woman's view point,4,"I enjoy how it handles and the interior storage for five person seating.  I was very pleased with the space and comfort on long trips.

suzuki,xl7,2005,Wanda, 05/24/2006,Good Family Vehicle,4,My XL-7 is a great family Vehicle.  It's small enough to park anywhere yet roomy enough to fit 7 comfortably with room for storage.  I highly recommend this inexpensive SUV for the price conscious consumer.  
suzuki,xl7,2005,Jake, 06/02/2006,Flexible SUV for the Price,3,"This SUV can be found with lots of factory rebates if you're patient, resulting in a really good deal. It has lots of interior flexibility since the rear seats can move and be folded down for extra cargo space.  This is the only small-med size SUV I could find that had enough cargo room behind the second row seat to fit my two large dogs. Only a minivan could do the job better, and I needed 4WD. The only minivan with AWD anymore is the Toyota Sienna, which I plain couldn't afford."
suzuki,xl7,2005,Don, 01/03/2005,Its fun to drive,4,"My 2005 Suzuki XL-7 is fun to drive. 
It has good handling in city traffic. 
The driver's seat is not made for long 
drives though. Wind noise over 65 MPH 
makes the radio useless. Also, they used 
too much cheap plastic in the interior. It has 
easy entry and I like the door handles, 
which work well. I like the looks of 
the vehicle too. The engine really makes 
noise (runs fast) when started in cold weather
and this continues until it is warmed up. 
I had this issue checked out and supposedly
that's the way the engine is on all models."
suzuki,xl7,2005,luis, 01/19/2005,Very good SUV at a very affordable price,4,"I would recommend this SUV to anybody whos looking for Mid-size SUV at a very affordable price. I own a 2003 Limited with 45000 miles already and havent had a single problem with it. You get a lot of options that would cost you about an extra $10,000 in other models like the Toyota Highlander. There are some inconvenient, lack of room between benches, or a bit noisy once it passes the 50 miles per hou. The 185 HP is not enough either, but its performance in general is very good , considering that the price you pay is in the low 20s . This SUV  is been great off road or in the snow, as well as in very wet conditions. "
suzuki,xl7,2005,US Family Robinson, 03/05/2005,Cool,4," We traded our truck, which was roomy, powerful, and comfy  for our xl-7.  The truck also stayed thirsty not to mention the warranty was long gone.    The Suzuki had all the things we were looking for and then some.  We went shopping on the basis of warranty and service foremost.  We tried the Kiabut the Suzuki won out with more room.  We also got the 3rd row seat.        The suzuki is just overloaded with options that came with it standard,  where others, these cost a consumer extra.      I agree that the seating in the XL-7 is cramped, but we knew this from the get go and we love that we can fold the seats down for cargo space.     Our XL-7 isn't very old but we love it."

The vehicle as equipped, with everything is a great package.   The sound system is outstanding!  I particularly enjoy the heated leather seats.  A comparable mid-size competing SUV would have been considerably more expensive.  The XL-7 has sufficient power, but cannot compete with the 3.0 engines the competition offers.  This vehicle takes me where I want to go comfortably and with all the luxury of a more costly vehicle.  I'll forego the power for the luxury. "

The left side foot rest is great. The on dash controls make everything easy. The third row will definitely help you carry 7 passengers as long as they are not all adults.  The style and body shape are eye catching while the interior is equally exciting. So far my XL-7 has been very reliable and dependable. The engine power is adequate for towing. The pearl finish is beautiful, not quite white!  The interior has many compartments with easy access, and the rear hidden compartment is ideal with it's tray design. Overall I look forward to buying a Suzuki when and if I am ever ready to depart with the one I have. "

So many little things go wrong with it. the most recent thing is the cable to pop the hood has broken. AGAIN. this is the second time ive been unable to open the hood. also one of the door ajar sensors is malfunctioning so everytime u hit a bump the interior lights flash on and it dings. gas mileage goes is awful. its' a ""compact"" SUV. its smaller than a mini van and gets worse gas than my truck. for a vehicle that size with a V6 and such little horsepower it should get way better gas mileage. the tire inflation sensor malfunctions too."

suzuki,xl7,2005,Sara, 12/23/2005,Awesome Buy!,5,"I researched many midsized SUVs before choosing the Suzuki XL-7.  The selling point for me was all the options for the small price.  I would have easily paid at least $7,000 more for a Toyota Highlander or Honda Pilot.  We also have a '92 Suzuki Swift that has never given us any problems, so this was an easy decision for us.  I drove it in the rain for the first time yesterday and it handled quite well.  I didn't feel that safety in my previous car.  We are going to Lake Tahoe for Christmas and cannot wait to use the 4 wheel drive.  We have no problems manuvering this SUV in busy parking lots and tight spots.

I miss driving a car (pre- kids) and that is what I was hoping to buy. Unfortunately, at this time, that isn't practical. I need a vehicle large enough to cart my boys, their friends, sports equipment, and the dog around. I live in a remote area of NW New Jersey - it takes 20 minutes to get to the nearest grocery store - so I didn't want to buy a gas guzzling full size SUV. We have snowy winters and I love driving in the snow so 4x4 is required. The XL-7 was the answer. It provides all the features I need at a very reasonable price. It's fun to drive, good on gas, and the boys love the sound system.  So far, so good."

Has far as I know right now, it needs a balljoint, but everything works, I feel very confident driving it, and have no doubt it will last me a few years after rustproofing. My father has owned 3 grand Vitaras and they've been awesome. I wish they still made them in North America. If you are looking for a Suzuki? Buy one.

It is a very comfortable car to drive and hasn't given me any problems yet, but the engine is only adequate and gas mileage is poor.  Some of the features on the XL7 leave a lot to be desired as well.

Poor acceleration and gas mileage, averaging a paltry 17 city, 20 hwy. But so far, it has been bulletproof in terms of reliability at 72K miles.
No problems whatsoever.
With kids 11, 8, 7, we can still shoehorn 1-2 of them in the fold-down 3rd row.
Long trips we flip down 1 side of 3rd row and take plenty of luggage.

suzuki,xl7,2006,David, 07/14/2016,Best $27K I've spent,5,"Bought our XL7 Premium 4x4 new in May of 2006 and still own it.  It now has 110k on the odometer and I'm here to tell you that it's the best car I've ever owned in regards to being problem free and reliable.  This beast has never failed me.  Other than regular maintenance items, a p/s pump is all I've replaced.  When shopping for a new car back in 2006, I did my homework and checked all the sources for reviews and buying advice.  I knew that I was buying an old school SUV with full frame and that it wasn't going to be cutting edge with stability control and other modern features at the time.  Even today, the switch gear and controls still feel like new.  No rattles or squeaks and everything still works perfectly.   It's a bit clumsy in terms of handling and ride quality, but that's expected in the design of an 11 year old SUV.   The fuel mileage could be a little better and in all honesty, Suzuki should have stuffed another 20 or so horsepower into this little 2.7 V6.  It's definitely a little hp deficient, especially if you live in the mountains like we do.  On a positive note, this thing will literally climb a tree in 4wd low range.  The winter traction is unbelievable.  In summary, I've raised both my kids in this vehicle and would do it all over again. I will truly mourn the day I look in the rear view mirror and see our Suzie being left behind for a new SUV.
***UPDATE***
Now 13 years old and 132k miles on the odometer.  ""Suzie"" has been semi-retired as an extra vehicle in the our family.  We bought a new Nissan Rogue Sport last year for my wife.  We were on the verge of trading in the Suzuki at the time but couldn't go through with it.  Brought the old girl back home with us.  The kids both came home for the holidays this year and we ended up using the XL-7 on a road trip to see family due to the additional seating it provides.  This old girl is more like a family member to us than a car at this point.  Long live my Suzie.

This truck is great, not cheap looking inside and has much better 3rd row seats than the RAV4.  I don't understand where these other reviews I've seen are coming from.  In all my research (and I did A LOT) I never came across anything about this vehicle being unreliable over the last 5 years, which is pretty darn good.  It usually does not have any defects or people complaining about how they had to get this or that fixed as in MOST other consumer reviews.  I mean give me a break, it's nice inside, the woodgrain looks expensive, and it is comfortable...but probably not for larger people.  I love mine, and I got it for a great price."

Year 5: Gasket near oil pan ($200 part and labor)

Year 6: Change wiper motor front ($200 part and labor)

Year 7: A/C started to go (never replaced)"
suzuki,xl7,2006,binkys4deep, 06/01/2008,Not very pump friendly,2,"I'm not very in love with how fast the gas seems to go in my XL-7. And not only that, I had trouble with my air conditioning not even a whole year after buying it. My CD player is not working too well at this point. Things just seem to be going wrong while only having it less than two years  But at least most things are still under warranty. But who wants to have to get things worked on so soon? It served its purpose when I first got it, because I needed something that seated seven. And now that I don't need the space, I feel stuck because at this point, the car is only worth about half of what I still owe!"
suzuki,xl7,2006,Allisha, 06/17/2008,2006 XL7 My first SUV,4,"I just bought my XL7 less than a year ago, and the single CD player doesnt work, I have had my rotors ""shaved"" 2x, and my brake pads are completely wore down, and I am a very light braker! I'm confused with the OD button on the side of my shifter. This was the last car on the lot that I saw but once I jumped in, I knew I wanted it. Not a big fan of the wood trim in the car, but it does have style and that's what grabbed my attention. The gas is gone quite fast, but overall I would definitely buy another one although I'm having so many issues with this one. It's very reliable, and I trust the strength having my kids inside. I have filled this truck up with lots of people and lots of boxes. "
suzuki,xl7,2006,Cold War Vet, 04/11/2007,Excellent SUV,5,I live in an area were temperatures fall below -40 and the roads look more like horse trails because of its body on frame design it handles the punishment with ease. It has yet to get stuck in snow or on off road terrain. The build quality is superb.
suzuki,xl7,2006,Ray Suryadinata, 08/22/2009,Car withstood 7000 mile-trip,4,"Just came back from cross-country trip Toronto-Vancouver. Westbound through the northern U.S. states, return trip through Canadian soil.  The car was fun to drive, no back pain sitting and driving for 23 days.  With four adult passengers, loads of luggage and cooler being hooked up daily, the car didn't complain at all. This car has really exceeded my expectation by a mile."
suzuki,xl7,2006,Ray Suryadinata, 12/30/2008,"After 45,000 kms",4,"Car is still going strong. No engine issues, no accessories issues. Interior trim issue related to the 2nd passenger seat handle covers. Both sides came off and replaced under warranty. Carpeting in the third row seat area came off (kids inadvertently kicked them off). It turned out the carpet was not glued or fixed permanently but only inserted under the seat and held by Velcro fasteners. The third seats have been used quite frequently and are bearable for adults during short trips. Other than that the winter driving is super. In spite of 4 inches of snow, no need for winter tires as the 4WD system made the all-season tires still adequate. "
suzuki,xl7,2006,Mike, 10/28/2005,Reliable All-rounde SUV,4,"The looks are a bit dated with the Vitara shape. The fuel tank is too small. It has good safety features and the 3rd row is a big bonus.  I was never a big fan of the 2001 model.  The 2003 shape, with the redesigned front and rear end looks great. The chrome side steps are an improvement over the plastic ones."
suzuki,xl7,2006,sam, 08/31/2007,Nice family SUV,4,"I have used Toyota vehicles till now. We were reluctant to buy Suzuki. But when we compared Highlander to Suzuki, the price won and we decided to try Suzuki XL-7. XL-7 has still not disappointed us at all. It has been reliable, no troubles at all. So far satisfied with its performance. We used it to tow when we recently moved and it was great. Nice SUV."
suzuki,xl7,2006,Old Skool XL-7 owner, 11/28/2020,Best SUV if you need dependable bro like vehicle.,5,"What can I say, bought a brand new off the dealer's lot on 2001. Never gave me any problem from the day I took off the lot. Just oil change and regular maintenance. On 2015 the rust finally ate through most of the bottom exhaust, replaced it and 2017 the after market tail pipe again rusted and fell off. Following fall, the exhaust manifold finally cracked due to non other than rust. Then shortly after the crack, the rack and pinion started to leak power steering fluid. Served me well and didn't want to let go but I'm only allowed 2 parking spot on my condominium and other spot was occupied by a RV. Had Suzuki stayed in US market, I'd invest some $$$ to get the entire exhaust replaced and drive it another 17 years but lack of service and parts... To this day, I seldom look in used car mag for a nice decent shape XL-7 just knowing this SUV is one of a kind and nothing has come close to matching what it offered.

suzuki,xl7,2006,Jackie , 11/05/2005,Never again,2,"I drive for a living and the 2006 Suzuki XL-7 has the worst driver's seat, as far as comfort goes. The senor for the passaeger airbag goes out everytime someone over 250 lbs. sits in the seats. "
suzuki,xl7,2006,Johnny, 01/10/2007,"This is the #1 SUV, it rocks.",5,"I previously had a 2002 XL-7 in Puerto Rico.  It was perfect. This new model is just as good. It is highly underrated. It is at a level equal or above Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Kia and all the other Japanese, American and European brands. It is reliable, sturdy, extremely safe and economical. "
suzuki,xl7,2006,Ray Suryadinata, 07/04/2007,First three months,4,"We bought the car in 2007 and got an end of year discount on this 2006. The 2007 is bigger with larger engine and built in Canada. But this 2006 is the last import to Canada still made 100% in Japan. True the 2006 is less spacious than the 2007, but the 2006 seems to be built more solidly and has better standard features.  Just came back from 1000 km trip. The highway mileage was pretty good, better than expected considering still in break-in period.  We haven't used all seven seatings, but had six people several times and smallish adults in the third seat row had no complaints. "
suzuki,xl7,2007,guxu, 12/14/2006,Tons of Standard Features at a Low Price!,5,"We tested more than five SUVs with third row seats and we found that the Suzuki XL-7 provides the best value. It has a long list of standard features. Suzuki did not do a great job to advertising the XL-7. Some features were not even listed in their specifications. Many web sites have the wrong information too.  For example, the driver seat is 6-way power instead of 4-way power.  It has reading lights for the second row, not just the front row, etc. Our local dealer is very nice, and they have no-hassle pricing, which is far below invoice. I noticed small paint problem inside of the front window frame this morning. But overall the vehicle seems to be very well made. And I do not notice any cheap materials."

suzuki,xl7,2007,XL7 owner ny, 12/02/2006,Huge Difference from First Gen XL-7,5,"Coming from the 2004 the current model is vastly superior in ride comfort, dimensions, power (252 hp!) and technology / features.  Suzuki really went all out with the gadgets: remote start; navigation; power seats; quality leather & materials; chrome wheels; even tossed in the free vehicle alarm and XM satellite radio!  Compared to a similarly equipped Murano the XL-7 is approx $10,000 less.  This is an extremely safe vehicle with side curtain airbags in all 3 rows.  Suzuki really got it right with the new XL-7."
suzuki,xl7,2007,sr500mark, 04/02/2013,Great car in search of a engine,3,"I bought this car used with about 40K miles on it.
I did my home work and noted the P008 engine code frequency in user reviews.
Well this car was in great shape to I figured I'd give it a chance.
Interior is great, roomy and comfortable.
Rear climate controls are great for the second & third row passengers.
Car is really stable in the snow.
Brakes have a hard time hauling down this heavy car.
Gas mileage is nothing to write home about.
I get about 16 combined.
Fuel fillter cap started misbehaving at about 45k miles.
Transmisison developed a very slow leak.
Good luck finding the dipstick/filler!

suzuki,xl7,2007,robinjl, 11/21/2006,The BEST Decision I Have Ever Made!,5,"We have a 2006 Grand Vitara and love it.  We had a smaller car that just didn't seem very safe, so we decided to spring for a second SUV with a third row of seating.  We looked at Durangos, Chrysler Pacificas, etc... Nothing seemed as luxurious and spacious and priced right with high gas mileage, as the 2007 XL-7.  When I drove the XL-7 vs. the other vehicles, the visibility and control I had were awesome.  With two children, and a dog, this vehicle was the best purchase we have ever made.  "
suzuki,xl7,2007,Michael A. Sousa, 12/16/2006,Very Nice Car for a Road Warrior,4,"I love the XL-7.  I was the first one in the country to own a new one.  I crashed my old 2003 XL-7.  I went looking for a new vehicle and could not find anything as big with all the features for under $30,000.  I purchased the luxury model. It has three rows of seats, side airbags, all wheel drive, leather, heated front seats, and a DVD system for the kids. The DVD system plays MP3's, that's over 1000 songs per DVD. Also, it's a dual mode system.  That means that the kids can watch a movie and I can listen to my radio.  This truck's cons include the lack of heated mirrors.  My 2003 XL-7 had them and the Grand Vitara has them. This is a nice feature when driving.  Also, it has no Sirius radio, factory system has XM and no converter.  The only saving grace is a front auxiliary input. "
suzuki,xl7,2007,Jim, 01/04/2007,Great Entry from Suzuki,5,"The XL-7's driving comfort and ride are great. Its styling, especially the headlights, is unique and bold.  I already have 4,000 miles and have never encountered any problem.  In terms of safety, this SUV is deemed excellent as it is equipped with all available safety features.  The engine is very powerful with 253 hp coupled with variable valve timing, thus passing is very quick.  I purchased this car simply because of the engine, styling, and most importantly the affordable price. "
suzuki,xl7,2007,n2reds2012, 02/18/2015,Run as far as you can...even if it's free!!!,2,These vehicles are nothing but money pits!! Just got rid of mine finally ('07 with 97k) white paint started peeling at 50k and found out it's a paint defect Suzuki will not fix. Then the turn signal stalk quit turning off and the speedo would show you going 140 mph when your only going 60 mph. Then the check engine light came on and found out the timing belt was needing replaced...3k later and about 8 months it came back on again same issue. Turns out it's a common issue in this engine along with sludge build up resulting in a need for a new engine....even though changed oil every 3000 miles. Again it's a design flaw that's common. STAY AWAY!!!! At all cost!!!
suzuki,xl7,2007,dikay29, 04/30/2011,2007 Suzuki XL 7,2,"When we bought this car in January, 1009 we thought we hit the jackpot.
It had everything leather heated seats, remote start, entertainment center, etc.
About October, 2010 the check engine light came on wanting the gas cap tightened which we decided to change thinking the cap was wore out.
It kept going off and coming back on.
In November, 2010 on a trip in the rain we experienced the traction and stability control shut off. Before it was said and done we had to have the timing gear and chain replaced and the steering and pinion rack.
2 months later here we are trading vehicles because the timing chain needs to be replaced again and 2 different dealers are giving us attitude about it."

In that time, three wheel bearings were replaced, along with a rear strut ($600) and all new brakes.
The first impression I had was that I got a steal, nice SUV loaded with all the features at a low price.
All service was done at the dealer for the first 20,000 miles.
The inside looked nice, but was cheaply built.
Several plastic handles inside broke within a month.
The tires would never hold air, no matter what I did.
The check engine light came on at 40,000, indicating that the valves were sludged up and the engine would need replaced.
There are no aftermarket parts so it is expensive to repair,which happened often"
suzuki,xl7,2007,Carlos Lopez, 01/06/2007,Best Truck for the Money,5,"I bought this vehicle for my wife but I have driven it considerably.  We needed 3rd row seating and compared it with the Ford Freestyle and Honda Pilot. We thought the ride was comparable to the Pilot, but the features, price and appearance were more attractive. We love it. It accelerates well, has a smooth engine, and considering its relatively small size, it is surprisingly comfortable for the 2nd and 3rd row passengers."
suzuki,xl7,2007,Kschnulle, 01/14/2007,Affordable and Stylish,5,This is one outstanding stylish SUV. The value for the price is incomparable.

Winter 2010 the roads were horrible, but I was on my way home with my kids in the car and All these lights went off telling me the traction control and stability control shut off, and another thing shut off, well I went to slow down to go around a turn and pushed the breaks to the floor and no breaks. Called for someone to come get the kids and take them home called the dealership and told them what was going on they swore there was no way that I had them to the floor in the first place"

suzuki,xl7,2007,Twilliams, 07/18/2010,Repair warning,4,"Bought this vehicle after considering the Highlander, Pilot and decided to take a chance with Suzuki (and save $9K) Knew going in the resale would not hold up well but intended to drive it until the wheels fell off. Have been very satisfied with no problems in the first 48K miles. Recently had a rear window modulator go bad and the window dropped down, took it in to our favorite service tech and we found out that aftermarket parts are not available for Suzukis after 2006 and Suzuki is making bank selling parts. Total cost is $1100 to replace modulator and parts ($750) are only available from the dealers. Still love the vehicle and will drive it till the wheels fall off but worry about it. "

However, after only 60,000 miles, I realized why it was so cheap. The engine light came on and when we took it to the Suzuki dealer they informed us that there was sludge in the engine because we had not changed the oil. I had them pull my account - since the oil had been changed at the dealer ever 3000 miles -they then informed us that the warranty was no longer good 60,543 miles! It ran out at 60,000. We had to spend over $3000 to have the engine rebuilt by a local garage. Suzuki said it would cost us $7000.
Do not buy this vehicle."

suzuki,xl7,2007,S. White, 06/28/2008,Our 2007 XL7 AWD with Platinum Package,4,Solid comfortable ride city and highway. City gas mileage could be better. We average about 14 but that's at 25 to 35 mph and a lot of traffic lights. Drove from Louisville to Miami fully loaded and got around 23 to 24 at 75 to 80 mph. You can haul a lot of stuff in it. Small back window creates an adventure at times backing up. Vehicle is very peppy and the blizzard we had last winter did not phase the all wheel drive. The only problem so far was a brake light went out but the dealer replaced at no charge
suzuki,xl7,2007,Jo, 01/21/2008,Good car,4,We liked our 2005 XL7 so much that when we decided to get a new car we got the same model in a newer year. We also got the limited package instead of the base model. I love this car. It is great for taking the kids on a trip or just going to the grocery store. I love having the ability to have as much room as I need. 
suzuki,xl7,2007,BOBBY, 06/23/2009,We Love Our XL7 So Far,4,We just purchased this rig a few days ago with 33k. The first thing we did was take it on about a three hour trip. We love the roomy interior. Seats were pretty comfortable. I had plenty of leg and head room. The accellaration was great! Fuel econommy accoring to the onboard trip computer hit 26mpg on the freeway. Lots of cargo room. For the price we feel this is an excellent value. I see some people are whinning about cheap inerior panels. Sure they could be better. If you want better get off your wallet and buy a Caddillac or something. For the price we feel this rig is an excellent value. If we wanted nicer we would have spent more money. This has all the features and comfort we need.
suzuki,xl7,2007,RB, 07/06/2009,GOOD RELIABLE RIDE,4,Purchased approximately 16 months ago. Have had no problems with vehicle.  Comfortable on long trips.  Rides more like a car than an SUV.  Much nicer looking ride and bigger than my Chevy Blazer.  Good gas mileage for vehicle size and type.  Very good handling in the wintertime over the West Virginia mountains.
suzuki,xl7,2007,Dekker, 12/09/2009,Great used purchase,3,"I wouldn't be too impressed if i had purchased this new,however for a used vehicle its a great buy.The front (heated)seats are quite comfortable and ample leg room,I'm 6'1. Quick response from the engine and traction control can definitely be felt. Switching to manual shifting makes you realize where the extra horsepower is. Fog lights are a practical touch as well as a very functional roof rack. The dash just plain stinks, as others have mentioned a seam has appeared surrounding the passenger airbag, cheap plastic. I've gotten used to the location of the console window switches and actually prefer it, seriously. In summary recommend this vehicle only as a second hand purchase. p.s steering radius terrible"
suzuki,xl7,2007,Rick, 08/28/2010,Very disappointed,3,"I this car for three year. I don't like the window controls because they are on the middle. Is very confusing and uncomfortable when you can't to open or close them. my dashboard cluster went dead the dealer did not covered it. the engine broke and the dealer did not cover the expense because I did not had the receipts for the oil change. I told them that I always had it changed when the computer signal that it was time to change it. I had to spend 3000 dollars to get it fixed out of the dealer. they wanted $6700.00 just for the engine, so they just call me to get it towed out of the dealer. I wouldn't recommended to any one this car. I still have 3 more years on the contract. "
suzuki,xl7,2007,Nancy, 02/09/2008,Lovin' it,4,"I love the steering response but haven't enjoyed the lack of steering range.

suzuki,xl7,2007,JP, 10/06/2007,Best Bang For My Buck,5,"I shopped, drove, and pretty much evaluated every mid size SUV under 30k MSRP I could get my hands on over a 2 day period. After sitting down and discussing what we liked and didn't like about each vehicle the XL7 came away the winner. The ride is smooth, it has good throttle response, steering and handling are impressive. I took it up into the mountains and had a ball with the manumatic shifter. Things like leather heated power seats, power sunroof, AWD, Auto Temp Controls, etc., were out of reach cost wise in other vehicles were within our budget with the XL7.  Smooth sporty body lines and a price in the low 20s sealed the deal for us. A 7yr-100k warranty, this one is a no brainer. "

It is without a doubt the worst vehicle I have ever owned or driven. Suzuki has some really great vehicles that they design and build, such as the Grand Vitara and new SX4. This ain't one of them!  We sold it at a loss a month after we bought it. The previous evaluation was undoubtedly written by a dealer employee or salesman. Rating it a 10! Give me a break. It gets lousy gas mileage and has a noisy / thrashy engine. Its fit and finish are the worst I've ever seen, mismatched plastic, flimsy trim falling off in your hand. This is a thinly disguised Chevy Equinox, which is rated very low!"

Their highly trained techs took two and a half hrs and diagnosed catalytic converter needed replaced. Ordered parts and need to go back to fix...sometime. Dealer rep had a real unpleasant attitude. Only experienced this once before, also with a GM product (03 Pontiac). Swore I would never buy another GM product...should have learned my lesson previouly and stayed away from GM related items also.  Will I ever learn???       "
suzuki,xl7,2007,not happy, 06/30/2008,Hate this vehicle,2,"If you are stuck with one of these, be aware it has no value in a year's time. Terrible turning range, cramped cabin, very uncomfortable seats, they're too short for your legs, makes long trips tiring.  We have 2 children and the 3rd row seat really is a waste, because you need that room for storage. The dash quality is cheaply made and started puckering after 6 months.   After 2 days of this vehicle, we knew we'd made a mistake!"

I'm very wrong, can't believe the XL7, it's wonderful, can't think of anything other than why is it not as famous as the others in its class, they need to do some more advertising, this is a great car that people should know about. It's a joy to drive, looks fantastic with the peace of mind of 100,000 miles! Suzuki has come a long way from the 80s and 90s. Just try it, you'll love it!  "

suzuki,xl7,2007,ron, 03/12/2009,Good Basic Vehicle,3,"well, going on 2 yrs and this has been a very good car for us, comfy on long trips to Montana from seattle and was even getting 27 mpg on that trip. Generally getting 19 around town. It has a large gas tank compared to most SUVs in its class even though I honestly wish it was a 20 gallon tank.  HUGE cargo capacity for this class of suv, you can really load it up. It's not top notch but we only paid $19 grand for it, Got around great in 6 inch snow and just cable chains on the front tires. We looked at trading it in but after looking at all the other SUVs, the fuel economy, and the cost of those SUVs we decided to just keep it. Unfortunately, this car really lost a lot of its value."
suzuki,xl7,2007,jc2009, 04/30/2009,Really bad suspension noise,2,"I bought this XL7 brand new in August of 2007, it was back at the dealership on December for a loud noise coming from the front suspension whenever I turned or passed on a bump. It was there for about a month until finally they figured out what was wrong and fixed it. Now about 3 weeks ago the same noise came back, but guess what? The local dealership closed and now I have to drive about 4 hrs. to the nearest dealership because Suzuki wont allow me to take it anywhere else here locally. Stay away from SUZUKI, their customer service is horrible, they talk to you in a very unprofessional manner, and when you have a problem you are basically stuck with it.American cars are better..."
suzuki,xl7,2007,CHERYLWILLIAMS, 01/17/2008,Proud to own,5,"I am extremely happy with my XL7. I traded in my 2004 Grand Vitara, as soon as the re-designed XL7 hit the showroom. I am in love with this vehicle! I get many compliments on the aerodynamic look of the vehicle! The handling is outstanding, gas mileage is better than the Grand Vitara, much more spacious than my husband's 2007 Honda Pilot (he's envious). Dashboard design is beautiful!! Suzuki  has a real showstopper here!!"

suzuki,xl7,2007,MELISSA, 06/15/2009,Disappointed,4,When I bought this in Nov 06 I loved it. I still love it but I am having problems when I start it and the check engine light is on. It is at the dealer now. They supposedly fixed it but it did the same thing the day after I got it back (1400 bucks later). I still love it very much and just want them to fix it. Starting to worry. Heard it has a GM motor.
suzuki,xl7,2007,XL7, 06/20/2009,Poor choice,2, Had to sell at 24000 miles. Was using Quart of oil every thousand miles.Very expensive synthetic oil I might add. Lot of road rattles for a $30000 SUV. Poor gas mileage 13 city. Depreciated too much first 2 years. 2 accidents backing out of driveway because you can hardly see out the back.Dealer had in shop long time took the engine apart could not find the problem. Figure I would sell back to them out of frustration.Disapointing vehicle we planned to keep 7-10 years.
suzuki,xl7,2007,Steve Heinz, 06/25/2009,XL7 the wander-er,4,"Attracted first by looks, then acceleraton, then sound system, then fit. 2wd w/traction control. Car has a tendency to wander almost as if each wheel at times has a different amount of power than the other. We drive it but not as often as we would like because. Dealer has no explanation. Seems better without traction control. Wouldn't buy another one if it had a hint of this behavior. Love my 92 Jeep and 95 Subuaru. Suzuki looks good in the driveway."
suzuki,xl7,2007,rap808, 08/01/2009,great car,4,"I have bought this car in 2007. I fell in love with this car and still am. The price was good, and I also have 2 kids and they like to be in the back seat. I bought this car in case family comes to visit we can all go somewhere in one car. Oh and for the cargo it has quite a bit of room. The under storage that comes with the care all you have to do is just get like a screwdriver and look at the two screws. Once you take it out it has even more room and better. I love this car and wont get rid of it."
suzuki,xl7,2007,Upset in Florida, 08/06/2009,Airbag issues!,3,"I purchased my XL7 with approx 70 miles on it. First couple of months it was back at the dealers for repairs, spent more time there than with me. Then, going over a bridge and it sounded like a gun went off in the cab! The airbag on the passenger side went through the 1st stage of deployment in the dashboard. Took it in, no codes registered. However they did replaced the airbag and the dashboard. Now, here it is a few months later and it happened again! Same side.. first stage of deployment, no codes, but now Suzuki is saying.. sorry no codes.. it didn't happen.. I have the perforation mark in the dashboard from deployment! Everything is the same as the first time!"
suzuki,xl7,2007,Outback, 09/06/2009,Suzuki? How about Yugo 45!!!!,1,"We were naive when we purchased the Suzuki. We liked the power and style. Then, just months later with 7,000 miles things started to go wrong. It started rattling, the suspension dilapidated, the car's computer died, the power steering died. Now in September 2009, it has 66,000 miles and looks and drives like its 20 years old. Now it is only worth $6,500 and we have become upside down on the car. Overall, I think this is the worst car in the world.  "
suzuki,xl7,2007,More Disappointed, 09/11/2009,Mucho Disappointment,1,"My previous post ""Disappointed on 08/14/2007"" describes our early issues. Since then, catalytic convert changed, in shop 3-4 times because of engine shutting off in traffic, engine light on sporadically, engine stumbles sporadically, fuel gauge acting up, passenger dashboard airbag panel cracking. Everything in this vehicle is controlled by the computer, fuel, timing, transmission, etc. I have asked the dealer several times to please replace it. They ""Will not replace one unless a catastrophic failure occurs."" Overall hatred for this vehicle and frustration of trying to get it fixed has made ownership of another Suzuki product impossible. "
suzuki,xl7,2007,jolbina, 09/14/2009,"Who needs turn signals, horn or stereo?",3,"Car horn stops working every time I go to car wash.  Stereo/DVD replaced twice first year and a half. When stereo/DVD goes, turn signals stop working. I drive from gas station to gas station. Gas mileage is probably worst in class.  Will stick with Nissans and Hondas in future."
suzuki,xl7,2007,calibumpas, 10/28/2009,"Good Deal for the Money, Needs a Refresh",3,"Bought this to replace a '97 Grand Cherokee. Factors in decision were 5-star safety rating, usable third row, warranty, equipment, and price. I love the drivetrain (very responsive 3.6L and smooth 5-speed. AWD works seamlessly). After 30K miles it's getting 21MPG on average running Mobil Synth 0w-30 and Summer tires. Interior materials feel cheap to the touch and design is annoying in some important ways. A-pillars block vision around turns. I find my knee rubs on the console and my shoulder rubs on the b-pillar. Window switches are poorly-placed. Overhead console is garbage. Seats are comfortable enough but other factors distract me from a comfortable drive. You get what you pay for."
suzuki,xl7,2007,Katie, 11/06/2009,Love our Suzuki,4,"My husband and I travel for work and are in the car for hours at a time.  This is very comfortable on long trip and gets really good gas mileage.

suzuki,xl7,2007,Pleased Owner, 08/30/2010,Great little SUV,4,"Bought this car new at the end of the model year and have been pleased with it in nearly every respect. The engine is fast revving and powerful, a real surprise the first time I hit passing gear, zips 15 - 20 mph quickly when passing from 65 or 70. I get 17 mpg in city and have averaged 24 - 28 mpg on the highway @ 75 mph. Turning radius is as good or better than other SUV I have owned. "

This is a great little car, but just seems to be a step below the Mazda in style and quality. If money is your number one concern, by all means this is the car for you.  You wont find another SUV with DVD, leather, 3rd row for this price. Believe me , I checked relentlessly, BUT I still wanna Mazda CX9! "
suzuki,xl7,2007,ahs111, 02/02/2007,I'm in Love with My Car!,4,"After sliding off the freeway in my 2004 XL-7 during a bad winter storm (and then rolling and totaling it), I knew I wanted my replacement to still seat 7, but have front/all wheel drive instead, and side curtain airbags for all 3 rows.  Low and behold, I bought the 2007 model.  It is much improved over the old version.  I LOVE this car!  I've had it two months and have had opportunity to drive it on snow and ice.  It handles amazingly well in adverse conditions.  My gas mileage has been steadily climbing and at 2,000 miles it is already at 20 mpg.  The one downside: the stereo/DVD system stopped working and had to be replaced."
suzuki,xl7,2007,dlane, 02/17/2007,Love It,5,"I did a thorough comparison of vehicles when shopping.  The XL-7 compares very well for the price with other vehicles in its class. The trim level I selected includes a DOHC/252HP V6 engine with DVD/Sat radio, leather and 7 passenger seating.  It is hard to find all this for the price that I paid in any other make/model.  this truck is very fun to drive and looks great too.  "
suzuki,xl7,2007,William, 02/17/2007,"Second Suzuki, Better than My 2006",5,"I became a Suzuki fanatic when I bought my '06 Aerio.  It's little but has a powerful engine.  Now my wife drives a brand new XL-7.  It is roomy, handles like a fancy sedan, responds excellently and there's no way it compares to the Equinox. I tested both, the XL-7 has European window switches, a charger 4 manual speed, and most importantly my whole crew (3 kids), grandma, and grandpa fit comfortably in it. My salesperson provided outstanding customer service.  I paid under $23,000 for it. We are very happy with it.  We can't wait for the summer and drive it up to Yosemite. It;s too fancy for off road driving. "
suzuki,xl7,2007,JAN SOUDIJN, 04/23/2007,Surprisingly Good,5,"The Suzuki XL7 is a fun crossover SUV to drive both on the interstate and in the mountains. Areas of future improvement should be the brakes, which require a significant amount of pressure, and rear view visibility is limited. Fuel economy on the highways has been fair at 24 mpg. After 3500 miles not a single problem. Good value for the money. If you do your own oil changes it is no fun to get the oil filter off since it is easier to take out an appendix."
suzuki,xl7,2007,gc, 04/22/2007,Very happy - upgraded from 2004 Rodeo,4,"I really like this SUV.  VERY SAFE. Many safety features and strong crash test rating.  One of the best warranty programs available.  I upgraded from a 2004 Isuzu Rodeo (which I never had problem with) to the 2007 XL7.   I love the interior, very comfortable drive.  "
suzuki,xl7,2007,jpgatorfan, 04/22/2007,Crossover or crossuvan,5,"A crossover for everyone in the family. For dad a sporty powerful suv. For mom versatility and room of a minivan. For the kids style with dvd & gaming input. For elderly parent easy of entry and exit (ladder not needed). We bought the limited w/dvd and everyone just loves it and after 12 years in a minivan, that's a lot for a crossover. If you are looking for a crossover or minivan, don't overlook the suzuki XL7 '07. Fit and finish was great on ours - 2 months and 3 thousand miles, 19.2 mpg."
suzuki,xl7,2007,hef1175, 08/09/2007,Suzkui XL-7,4,"Excellent automobile in all catogories. I have driven this vehicle in the mountains, various types of terrain performance is excellent. Fuel usage is very good for an SUV, 24-26 on road, 21-22 city. Warranty 7 year standard 100,000 excellent, 3.6 V-6 outstanding. Standard options surpass all other brands. Safety is excellent. Tires, batteries for life is excellent."

suzuki,xl7,2007,Nick, 10/09/2007,My new Suzuki XL7,5,"My wife and I just purchased this vehicle last week.  We looked at the Pilot, Santa Fe and Highlander.  In comparison to all four vehicles, the Suzuki has more leg room, bigger cargo space, more fuel efficient and better features.  If you are looking to place a child in the back seat, it is very child friendly.  Also, I am 6'1"" and I sat in back of all vehicles (all 3 touched my knees) and this had the most leg room.  We were searching for a vehicle with a lot of room for a reasonable price and this vehicle met our needs.  Look at all 4 vehicles for yourself and you will see the difference."
suzuki,xl7,2007,Duane Owen, 08/11/2007,XL7=New Word for Value,4,"In 34 years operating my own auto repair facility I have not seen such value in a vehicle before. The GM 3.6LY7 engine in the XL7 is awesome. Aluminum block, forged steel crankshaft, dual overhead cams, 4 valves per cylinder, variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust, roller finger rocker arms, piston cooling oil jets (to cool the engine with no coolant for up to 50 miles), steel timing chains (not belts). True dual exhausts. A 5 speed Aisin AF-33 direct drive cool operating transmission and Toyota T4 fluid. Loaded, quiet, and comfortable well below 30K. Drive one!!"
suzuki,xl7,2007,Disappointed, 08/15/2007,Can I Change My Mind?,2,"The day after we brought it home we noticed fluid spots in the driveway. Under 3000 miles and the seals in the transfer case had to be replaced. The vehicle seems different now. At first we thought that we were experiencing road feedback because the vehicle feels like it's surging ever so slightly. But while on a smooth road recently, it felt like the transmission stumbled a couples times and then caught again because it pushed me back into the seat when it occured and it felt like a hard thunk. The vehicle is going back to the dealer for a look see but I doubt that they find anything. I also noticed today that a bolts holding the drivers door stop on are working themselves out. I want out!"
suzuki,xl7,2007,Debbie, 09/12/2007,I love this SUV!,4,"I love almost everything about my XL7.  It's stylish and classy looking.  It has room for 7.  The interior is very comfortable, and the ride is great.  "
suzuki,xl7,2007,thengkid, 05/21/2007,You Really Need to Drive This Vehicle,4,This is a excellent vehicle inside and out.  The engine is phenomenal and it drives like a luxury sedan.  Loaded up six adults (2 over 6' tall) w/child seat with ease.  Suzuki really hit this nail on the head.
suzuki,xl7,2007,Norwinmom, 05/25/2007,07 XL7 Garnet Metallic,4,"I really enjoy this vehicle.  It's roomy, handles nicely and is unique and stylish.  I feel like I bought a luxury car without the luxury price.  Mine is the base model and does not have the 3rd row of seats, so I have loads of cargo room which is great for groceries, and the kid's sports gear or whatever else I need to haul.  It rides very nice, getting in and out is easy because it's not that high off the ground, but it's not too low either.  But when you're driving it, you feel like it's up a little higher than a car mostly because of the adjustable seat.  I'm short, so I have it the whole way up.  All in all, the more I drive it, the more I love it."
suzuki,xl7,2007,RICHESTER, 06/25/2007,Happy with new XL7,4,"It took me lots of reading and thought to choose, but when all was said and done I am happy we bought this new XL7. My wife still has the older version which has proven to be extremely reliable and worth its own. The new one, side by side, shows a complete redesign. We have all the added safety features and third row (all worthwhile) and our children are fascinated with the DVD (it even comes with wireless headphones). Driving is fun, the leather interior is a big plus and the seat is wider than the old version. Seat belts are all 3 point and it has 8 airbags (6 side 2 front). The AWD and the automatic stability control do not affect the joy of driving it but it feels different than our old one."
suzuki,xl7,2007,sidharth, 07/06/2007,A Great SUV for the price.,4,"I just bought the XL7 after a lot of research and going to toyota, honda and hyundai dealerships. The XL7 is very well priced SUV for 7 with nice features for price about 4-5k less than others and it really does have third row seats you can sit in. The other SUVs had them for the sake of just having them. Suzuki could have done better with interiors I think. There is a little engine noise while while taking off but on the whole it's value for the money I think. Took it on a long drive and it was clearly a winner. My advice test drive Pilot, Highlander, Santa Fe and XL7 before you buy one because it's only then you will know if you like it."
suzuki,xl7,2007,hef1175, 07/27/2007,Suzuki XL-7,4,"This XL-7 is excellent in many categories. Engine horse power is outstanding. Safety features have the consumer in mind. Ride is quiet and comfortable. Standard equipment is perfect. Warranty fully meets the needs. Fuel economy is within most SUV's ratings, needs improvement."
suzuki,xl7,2007,Viacheslav Garmash, 10/30/2007,Fun SUV,4,"I've had this car for more than 6 months and am completely satisfied with it. It is roomy, powerful and fun to drive. Handles very easily; it's very fast. Great cargo space when 3rd row is folded. I am looking forward to testing the trailer hitch because one of reasons to buy this car was 3500 lb trailer towing ability.  We had couple very long trips in it and I can say this car is very comfortable. For example my wife and I drove from Grand Rapids, MI to Niagara Falls, NY. It took us about 12 hours to get there and in the end of the day we still had a lot of energy to walk around and enjoy the Niagara Falls.  I feel very confident when I drive this car in any season."
suzuki,xl7,2007,tnt, 10/26/2007,Great CUV,5,This unit drives out great. More power than the Equinox and more cargo space. Not to mention the extra years on the warranty.  I think that GM did Suzuki a favor by putting the 3.6 in Xl7.
suzuki,xl7,2007,Porter, 10/28/2007,Great car,5,This car is great bigger than toyota and all the others in its class great price and great looking A+ suzuki! Have put 1080 miles on it so far and loving every minute its a powerful engine and very comfortable.
suzuki,xl7,2007,Daveyboy, 11/26/2007,More people should consider the XL7,5,"We bought an XL7 luxury package with a sunroof and 3rd row, and we LOVE it.  Two days after we bought it we we made a 6 or 7 hour trip to Virginia and the car performed great, we figured gas mileage wouldn't be too good since the car wasn't broken in but it got 23 mpg and was comfortable on the trip, with size and style and features and great price and warranty I have no idea why these aren't more popular, we are very pleased and look forward to many miles with our XL7. If you are considering Pilot, Highlander, or the like you should really shop at Suzuki as well."
suzuki,xl7,2007,Mommakell, 11/30/2007,I Love It!!!,5,"Previously I owned a Nissan Maxima and I swore that when I was ready to make another purchase it would be another Nissan.  Well a friend I work with bought a XL-7 and I drove it one day and I fell in love!  I am now the proud owner of my own XL-7 and I could not be more happy and proud.  I just took my grandson to Disney for his 3rd birthday, it was 2,000 miles round trip and it was reassuring to be in such a safe feeling and reliable vehicle."
suzuki,xl7,2007,Melissa, 03/31/2008,Too many trips to be repaired!,4,"We purchased our XL7 after reading and researching all the midsize SUV's. The honeymoon was over about 3,000 miles into it. We have had to take it back to the dealership 3 or 4 times because the ""motor mount"" kept causing problems with the ignition and thumping and knocking noises from the bottom. We also had trouble with a clicking sound in the odometer area. They told us at the dealership that it would resolve itself...not. Love the look of the car and would be 100% satisfied if we hadn't had to keep going back for repairs (the same thing each time) Seems like Suzuki didn't work out all the kinks on the 2007 XL7. We probably won't buy another, but what do you do? We'll keep it for now."

After purchaing the Suzuki XL-7, I have decided this vehicle overall is the best vehicle. The XL-7 performance is oustanding, ride outstatnding, handling outstanding, safety outstanding,value far better than most products on the market. I have driven this vehicle in all types of climates and terrain it has performed above and beyond.

suzuki,xl7,2008,K.M., 04/06/2016,I relate..Good&Bad.,3,"The bad-Reading through these reviews has opened my eyes to a few things..i tried opening my pass side door and found myself standing outside of the  vehicle holding the door handle in my hand,I see others have had the same thing happen and my locks can be tricky sometimes & now i realize the locks must not be great to begin with if its happening on other xl-7's...and my last complaint is the fenders i read others have had their fenders start to pull out of place which has happened on both front fenders of my Suzuki.
The good-
It has amazing space,3rd row. My kids can control their heat/air from the back seat & the vents are on the roof so they dnt play with them,they stay in the position i put them in. I like the rear wiper blade,nice to have in a 3d row to make it easier to see in snow/rain. There is a charger port in backseat as well,comes in handy for kids & their electronics. Alot of Space when putting dwn the seats. Back hatch opens very nice but i had one problem with it slowly shutting itself only happened one time. I bought my Suzuki used & over 5 yrs old but have read that even a few yrs newer have the same issues..Locks/Fenders/Door Handle/Sensors. So it must be a common problem and i wldnt purchase this vehicle for any more than half of the price its worth bc of the problems but i do recommend buying it if its at a low cost or reduced price,bc it seems to have no major issues and is a nice family vehicle when all the little things aren't going wrong. Thanks everyone Your reviews really helped me understand my vehicle & that im not at fault for those things.

suzuki,xl7,2008,metrodesign, 12/24/2012,Excellent SUV,4,"This is a follow-up review I posted at 22,000 miles under the name ""Michael."" Now I have 64,000 miles on this vehicle and am just as impressed as I was back then. I have had almost no problems (still original brakes) and consider the performance superb. The best features are: acceleration, smooth power transfer, handling, stability and reliability. The only repairs I had was to replace the driver's door handle twice and replace the anti-sway bar bushing and links, but this is a small price to pay for an otherwise excellent vehicle. It needs quality tires like Goodyear CS Assurance TripleTred for good handling."

suzuki,xl7,2008,Tom LaBuff, 12/30/2015,XL-7: STILL much more than expected.,4,"I bought/ leased the XL-7 because it was a great deal and my friend recommended the car based on his positive experiences with an older model. When the lease was up, I purchased the car outright!  It has served me very well for over 11 years. Over the first 8 years there was only a minor glitch (timing chain kit needed replaced) which was taken care of by the warranty, and I had to replace the hatch supports. Just recently, however, I had to have the timing chain kit replaced again after only two years. No warranty coverage this time and it wasn't cheap. $2000!  Additionally, the wheel bearings on the front wheels also needed replacing. And the hatch struts had to be replaced again. I was not happy. Inferior replacement parts, perhaps? Other than that the car continues to be reliable. It seats seven adults, though the rear seat should be reserved for smaller folks or kids. I've had three teenage girls ride comfortably back there! It rides comfortably and fairly quietly; it has an extraordinary number of standard feature not usually found on a base model. And it can be used to haul a LOT of stuff if you choose to put all the seats down. The gas mileage is not great - 15-17 around town and 22-28 on the highway. But it has, otherwise been a low-maintenance vehicle. A great family car.

suzuki,xl7,2008,rdparks, 07/14/2011,Great SUV for the money,4,"Bought this car used as an import from the States.
My wife insisted on a vehicle with leather, 7 seats and AWD.

The car has been completely problem free since we bought it over 2 years ago.
Oil changes cost a ton but are miles apart because it requires synthetic oil.
We have put over 50K (Miles not Kilometres) on the vehicle since we bought it.

It does lack sex appeal and the interior feels cheap. But after a bit we have become very comfortable with the car and are very happy

I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone."

When I saw the XL7 I figured let me take this for a ride, it really was not high on my list. But after looking at all the features you get for the money, it probably is the best value on the market. It has a solid but smooth ride, great pickup and has nice style both in and out.  It has one of the best warranties in the market, very little maintenance. It even has a timing chain, instead of a belt, so you don't have that periodic $500+ expense.  Although 7 passengers is a stretch, 5 or 6 can fit fine."
suzuki,xl7,2008,volleyballmom, 01/06/2012,Not reliable,2,"I thought I had found the perfect car when I purchased my XL-7 three years ago.
I couldn't get rid of it fast enough after 30,000 miles.
The little things that should happen at 70,000 miles happen at 25,000 miles with this car. The paint peels, the locks break, the levers fall apart, lights and sensors come on.
The factory tires are aweful.
Not a good value."
suzuki,xl7,2008,pat chambers, 09/06/2010,sun roof leak,4,this car is great but I would never ever buy another Suzuki because the sun roof leaks all the time and the interior is soaked with water coming in all the lights overhead.  Have had it to the dealer 5 times with no help.  I am totally disgusted and will never buy another Suzuki product.  I have talked to 8 other people with the same sun roof problem with no success.
suzuki,xl7,2008,Bill, 09/07/2010,Having problems,3,"Purchased XL7 June 09 for $14K with 23K & now have less than 39K miles.  The vehicle is well maintained. So far, its been returned to dealer for repairs under warrenty to A/C not cooling & 2 door lock actuators not working.  The tires began to wear, so I paid for new tires & alignment in April 2010, which I thought was to soon.  On aug 15, 2010, I opened the back side door & the exterior door handle came off in my hand.  I drove to the nearest Suzuki dealer & was told that it was not under warrenty.  Called Suzuki of America & their Region Rep took a look at it & said that no ""goodwill"" would be provided.  Suzuki needs honor their vehicles quality & repair the door handle at no cost to me."
suzuki,xl7,2008,Jim, 07/01/2009,Love this Car!,4,"I have driven, for the past ten years Saabs, and before that, Mercedes.  When it was time to replace my 9 5 Saab station wagon, I looked around.  By chance I rented an XL7 for a weekend to haul some things, I fell in love with the car, smooth, powerful, compfortable, stylish, and well finished. Also, the price was great, with 4600 miles, paid 60% of list.  This is a great car, in a little over a month have put on 4,000 miles, and they have been much more enjoyable than in my Saab or Mercedes.  Great, great car!  "
suzuki,xl7,2008,clmt, 07/14/2009,Love it!!!!!!!,5,I wanted to buy honda CRV until l test drive XL7 2008. I fell in love with it. The price was half CRV and has great warranty. I recommend it to all.
suzuki,xl7,2008,Jennifer, 10/13/2009,Love my XL7!!,4,I knew I had to have the XL7 as soon as my husband and I test drove it!! I love the room it has inside.  The third row is so convenient. The storage is great and it rides really good. My daughter even loves it! Not too big and not too small. Perfect size for the three of us. Had no trouble out of it so far. I LOVE my XL7!
suzuki,xl7,2008,Michael, 10/18/2009,This is an excellent SUV,4,"I purchased this vehicle with 9800 miles. It now has 22,000 miles after 7 months. My wife owns an RX 300 and I have had Saabs for 25 years. Previous to that I had a Corvette and Volvo and my most recent vehicle was a fully loaded Montana mini-van. I mention this in way of letting you know my past experience as a way of evaluating my judgment. This XL7 is a remarkable vehicle. It has performed flawlessly. Is is very fast because of the horsepower, torgue and perfect match to an excellent transmission. Braking is excellent. Road handling is superb. (My son had trouble keeping up with me in his Subaru WRX on a curvy road.) The XL7 wants to run at 80 mph, is very quiet and has a smooth ride. "
suzuki,xl7,2008,lilly85, 01/30/2010,LOVE MY XL7!!!!,5,I bought my XL7 close to a year ago and its the best car that I have ever driven! I had a Jeep Grand Cherokee before this car so I wasn't sure how I was going to like the AWD compared to the 4 wheel drive but it handles really well. I have never worried about getting places and I've driven in pretty deep snow drifts. My husband has to keep reminding me about the speed limit because this car just wants to go! The ride is comfortable and my Grandma likes it because its easy for her to get in and out. I wish Suzuki would keep making these because I would buy this car over and over again!
suzuki,xl7,2008,Tim, 04/24/2010,Surprised,4,"After test driving several vehicles, the Suzuki stuck in my mind better than any other.  The size, and agility were the most impressive. I have no problem downshifting to help pass on the highway. Around town is fun to drive too."
suzuki,xl7,2008,hav, 09/11/2010,Likin' it so far...,4,"Bought it to tow a trailer from CA to SD in addition to the good cargo space. Did great.  Got 23-24 mpg with trailer.  Mileage is very responsive to speed. If you don't speed, the mileage increases, go figure! Car has been great for the couple months I've had it and made the long trip without a hitch(figuratively)."
suzuki,xl7,2008,krjohnson, 07/03/2011,My worst purchase ever,2,"When I purchased this vehicle, I was not looking for an SUV. Due to the fact that there was a $5000 rebate, and I was promised by the dealership that ""they"" would furnish free tires for life as long as I owned the vehicle. Within the first two weeks of owning the car, the dealership closed, so all promises were off. At 55,000 miles, every light on the dash came on. The timing chain and a wheel barren had to be replaced. The lights continued to come on, they replaced a motor mount. There is an annoying constant noise in the steering, warranty does not cover this, and the front driver's side fender comes loose every time the car is driven. American Suzuki is not willing to buy the junk back."
suzuki,xl7,2008,David, 01/21/2009,Yes a steal compared to the competition,4,"Best bang for the buck, looked at much smaller suv's with zero room behind the supposed 3rd row that's built for a dog or cat, oh and if your kids are in the third row and your hit from behind, good luck!  Anyway needed something that the kids or an adult could could actually sit comfortably and with room behind the third row for luggage, groceries, etc. This was it!  With the rebates and incentives they took 8k off sticker! You cannot buy anything like this at that price!"
suzuki,xl7,2008,Maria Robinson, 06/26/2009,Excellent for the money,4,I love my Suzuki XL7. The only thing I do not like is that the rear visibility is poor. I had to purchase a rear camera after rear ending a my bicycle.
suzuki,xl7,2008,DRS, 07/25/2010,Nightmare,3,Nightmare from day one! On the way home after purchase shimmy in the front brakes. Had to true rotors. Transfer case and left axle seals leaking. A/c quit had to replace havc head. Cd player quit had to replace radio/cd unit. Driver door was sticking had to adjust. Horn quit had to replace. Wipers quit had to replace wiper control. Had mold coming out of air vents had to replace evap coil in the a/c. Esp and traction control quit working had to replace hydraulic control unit. My just found new problem is my tire pressure monitoring system. My rf reads as my rr and vice versa. This is my story! I can't use the lemon law because they are all different problems! All these nice reviews. Why me?
suzuki,xl7,2008,ckfranz84, 12/06/2011,Beware of Suzuki,2,"I did alot of research before purchasing a new car, and intially did not think about a Suzuki, but the dealer had this for a fantastic price with very little mileage. Since it was my first nice car I went for it, and was excited but now 2 years later I couldn't be more disappointed. In the past few month the paint has started to crack, and chip off in big chunks on the roof and hood, but Suzuki will not fix it because it is out of its 36000 mile warranty, even though it is obviously a manufacturer defect. I am very frustrated with Suzuki, and for this problem alone would not recommend buying from them."
suzuki,xl7,2008,7passenger awd suv, 09/09/2009,Exceeds Expectations,4,"I have driven this XL7 over 15000 miles in 6 months,on the highway(gets up to 80 mph like a champ),in town accelerates with the best,reliable performance every day;Great Car!Wife loves it(and she drives a luxury car costing twice as much.) Have had ""0"" problems, except would like to buy driving/fog lights to look cool and can't seem to find any. W.C.Smith"
suzuki,xl7,2008,Ktzdahdee, 01/28/2020,Just bought stinky old one!,5,"I LOVE THIS THING! Got it for $1500 with 137k miles on it. Upstate NY. TINY amount of rust. Owner was a smoking slob! STIIIINNNKY!! Will have it detailed in the spring.  Feels tight, runs VERY strong. Afraid to open power sunroof right now. Dead of winter. Blower switch blows only high speed. Bought part. Hopefully fix when warmer out. Heated seats work! Radio sounds ""tinny"".  I love driving this thing! I call it ""The Beast"". Worst thing about it is that it REALLY is hard to see out the back window!! Think I might get aftermarket rear camera for it.
"
suzuki,xl7,2008,J C Sanchez, 06/30/2008,Not bad for 27K,4,"This is my first new ride, and I am quite pleased with my selection. I haven't had much time to drive it as it seems I'm busy 24/7 with my 2 jobs, but at least I got to take it about 60 miles outside of Denver the other day (and then back) and I'm very impressed with its ride/stability/performance and toys. With the navy blue paint and factory chrome wheels, I get plenty of compliments on my selection."
suzuki,xl7,2008,RUBEN, 08/16/2008,Great price and fun to drive,4,I bought this car for my wife and I'm not dissapointed. The XL-7 looks great inside and out I would recommended  to family and friends planning to buy a great mid-size SUV!
suzuki,xl7,2008,Pikie, 09/14/2008,Best kept secret -- ever!,4,"I love this SUV so much that I just bought a second one! Very few people know anything about this vehicle. This SUV has standard stability control, traction control, ABS, 5 spd auto/manumatic transmission, auto door locks/headlights, side curtain bags - all rows, climate control, alloy wheels, privacy glass, IPOD input, 252 hp GM high feature engine(same used in Cadillac CTS, Buick Enclave, although, XL7 engine built in Japan), 7yr/100,000 mile warranty with roadside assistance, 3/36 bumper to bumper that covers even the dome light,driver information center (which allows to program lights,doors,etc),tire pressure monitor (tells you pressure for each tire). Quad 5 Star crash rating too.It's not an Equinox!"
suzuki,xl7,2008,parkaholic, 12/08/2008,"""S"" is for super",4,Looked for a long time at SUV's and decided not to buy because of price. Saw the XL-7 in a parking lot and thought it looked cool. With incentives I got XL-7 for about $9K less tha a similarly equipped Toyota or Honda. I drove it cross country and averaged 24 mpg while traveling 75 mph. I have had no complaints with fit and trim although engine noise was present during break in. Only thing I would change is the power seats need to be eight way vs six.
suzuki,xl7,2008,ed, 12/30/2008,Great bargain SUV,4,"Purchased a 2008 luxury trim model for the wife. So far, so good. She likes the comfy seats with heaters and the ride is smooth and car-like. The AWD is a Godsend on our horrific unfinished roads. Smooth, powerful 3.6L engine with excellent 5 speed auto trans. "
suzuki,xl7,2008,Noah, 12/30/2008,Excellent choice,5,"I have been eying the XL7 for some time now. I owned an Aerio SX but I was hit by an elderly woman and it was totaled. I was in Japan for 3 years and all I saw was Suzuki cars every where. Hardly any Hondas. So when i got back to the States I went to the dealership offered $19000 and i drove it off the lot. I have no complaints, rides smooth and it looks good. I would call it a crossover before an SUV.   "
suzuki,xl7,2008,Vicky, 01/29/2009,Just Purchased and Lovin it!,4,"After shopping around, my friend suggested the XL7, and I am glad I looked.   I was amazed at the features that were included with the car and such a great price!  It's sporty and stylish, yet roomy enough for my entire family.  Great car for an amazing price."
suzuki,xl7,2008,Jeff, 02/04/2009,What A Change For The Better,4,"I just bought my 2008 XL7 2 weeks ago.  I had been drivng a pickup for the last serveral years.  I feel like I am in heaven now drive this new ride.  My wife has the SX4 Sport and we love it.  Now we have two Suzuki products and do not plan on getting any other for a very long time. Plus I got at a great price. From rebates and customer cash back I am paying less than I was on the truck.  And it turns heads.  I have had several people ask me about it. I even had a guy in his (Acura SUV)the other day tell me that it was a ""very sharp ride man"".  "
suzuki,xl7,2008,Lewison, 02/17/2009,Would definitely buy it all over again!,5,"I upgraded from the Grand Vitara to the XL7 to accommodate our growing family and the extra space in the back is shockingly roomy! I can fit a large baby stroller, suitcases, and dogs all in the back together at once. My husband has even been impressed with the smooth car like ride and roominess. I love the acceleration too!  It's power is definitely understated since it moves much better than many other SUVs I've driven. "
suzuki,xl7,2008,DEAN- LI, 03/02/2009,Great SUV,4,"Bought the vehicle used with 9K miles on it from the dealer. The car new was 30K and I paid half that. This is my 3rd Suzuki vehicle. Presently still has 2003 XL-7 with 96K(runs great). The car has fantasitc power, smooth tranny and is confortable to drive. The fact that the car is AWD is a big plus in the snow. Interior quality, fit and feel are just fine for me. I have pulled my boat with my 2003 XL7 without a problem and the extra 70+ HP will prove to be a great addition. 22MPG in the highway and about 18MPG around town. At this point I could not be happier."
suzuki,xl7,2008,Kris Hoepfner, 03/04/2009,Love it! (so far),4,"After looking at many, many choices for an SUV to replace our family Caravan, I had exhausted just about every option and was destined to pay 30K+ for an SUV that had all the options I wanted in a family transport. I happened to glimpse an XL7 while eating at a fast food place one day. I didn't even consider Suzuki as an option, but started doing some research and decided to chose something ""out of the box"". I have to say I've not been dissapointed. It's been a great SUV and was well within my budget with all the ""bells & whistles"" a much more expensive Acadia or GMC, Tahoe or Yukon would have been."
suzuki,xl7,2008,Janet, 03/15/2009,I love my XL7,4,"Suzuki performance quality, and reliability are hard to beat.  So much more comfortable than the Highlander or Pilot.  Wish it got better gas mileage, but it is a V-6 SUV afterall."
suzuki,xl7,2008,Paul, 03/16/2009,Why I bought one?,5,"I read all of the guru's comments as well as consumers.  Believe the CONSUMERS. I own BMW's, Hummers2's,Cadillacs,Corvettes and now a GREAT Suzuki XL7. While being a low cost vehicle I purchased one, and found it to be exciting to drive with 33mpg hwy first time driven with exciting performance! Comfortable ride,roomy,and one of the best buy vehicles in the market.  The warranty is second to none, and you will be pleased with the cost of purchase too! Sometimes the guru's compare to many cars to really understand what people are looking for. And try and compare apples and oranges.  BUY ONE"
suzuki,xl7,2008,Cromag, 12/30/2007,Happy,5,"We had been looking for some time at what to buy, we had setled on a rendevoux, realized they discontinued, looked at the XL7 and drove it, bought it and wife and I love it. Black with leather, can always find something wrong with anything if ya look hard enough, but for the money, we are very happy."
suzuki,xl7,2008,rap808, 03/29/2009,great ride,5,I love this car. The first time I seen it I had to have it. We had a Mitsubishi evo and I didn't like the no room in the car. But this car I have room a lot of room. I watch children and I can fit them in my car if I have to go anywhere. This is the best car for me and I love it. The space in the back of the third row can be roomy if you removed the cargo tray. It will be much deeper and give you quite more room. I have noth9 ing negative about this car. I will have it forever.
suzuki,xl7,2008,TonyGee, 04/09/2009,Saved $10000 at Least!,4,"We had been looking at purchasing a car to replace an aging (84K) 2003 Cavalier. Our search took us into used car territory. It turns out that a company in Ohio, which leases these things to rental companies, was trimming the fat due to the economy. Our model had 10400 miles on it and was in service less than twelve months. We need this kind of room. Our other car is a KIA Spectra. Almost monthly, we are on the road to Nashville. Getting stuck in Atlanta traffic will almost be a pleasure. I am over six foot one, and my wife is five ten. There is so much room; and for the price and reliability this machine is unsurpassed. It's an even better deal at the price we paid!"
suzuki,xl7,2008,BJM2009, 04/14/2009,Nice Ride!,5,"I bought my Suzuki with only 6,000 miles on it and love it so far (have only had it a couple of weeks). I had never looked at a Suzuki before let alone test drive one but once I did I knew it would be the perfect car for my family. It has everything that I want...heated seats...moonroof...and I especially love the jack for mu IPOD..there are a lot of vehicles out there that do not have this feature. I got a really good deal on mine, originally a $30k vehicle. I love the third row seats and the storage compartment in the back floor. The second row seat has plenty of legroom and the seats are raised so it's more comfortable for taller people like myself (5'10). I give this vehicle an A+!!"
suzuki,xl7,2008,Jim, 05/12/2009,So Far So Good,4,"No problems with comfort, performance, reliability. Gas milage pretty good for a big SUV. Single CD player is quirky and will have to have it serviced(stops playing and cd won't eject). Purchased at dealer as an Executive use vechicle with 4,600 miles on it. Well kept by user. Overall is pleasant and comfortable to drive. Has good pickup when needed. I generally drive under speed limits on highways to save on gas. Good cargo space. No third row on this one. No complaints. I've owned Hyundai Sante Fe & Nissan Xterra and like this SUV better than both, although the Sante Fe is also a very good value for the price."
suzuki,xl7,2008,PappyPwnerton, 05/18/2009,What a deal.,4,"I bought my XL7 in Dec 08 with 96 miles on it. For the money there is not a better deal. The motor has amazing power and it moves much quicker than you think. In upstate New York the AWD was a must with over 114"" of snow a year. I never managed to get it stuck. I never thought of buying a Suk, we where looking at Jeep Commander, after reading reviews I made much better choice. The 3.7 Liter in the Commander was way underpowered. I have 3 kids, its comfortable and fun to drive. I would have spent much more for a similiar SUV."
suzuki,xl7,2008,Retired2PA, 05/19/2009,Look out AWDs there's a new kid in town,4,"I was looking for an SUV/Cross Over that had lots of room, some bells & whistles, and a nice ride for a good price. After two months of looking I chose the Suzuki XL7. I found a used 2008 with just over 10,000 miles for under $16,000. It has good engine power, huge cargo capacity, and is a pleasure to drive. It has plenty of  amenities right down to the padded area below the ignition so your keys won't make noise as they hit the steering column. It's very comfortable and handles great. On a recent trip we averaged 26mpg with the air on for half the trip. We get 17mpg around town. The AWD will come in handy in the winter here in PA. Be sure to test drive one of these before you buy.    "
suzuki,xl7,2008,Bob, 05/16/2009,Tickled with XL7,4,"Just bought mine used (6,000 Miles) from a major dealer. Great style, power and interior space. Love the fit and finish and bought it for 40% less than list at new. Great car for kids, w/side airbages and plenty of storage."
suzuki,xl7,2008,teacher, 06/18/2009,Crossover to Susuki,4,Before I purchased my Susuki I drove a Lexus RX300. I could not afford to buy another Lexus but wanted all the bells and whistles of my Lexus. I would never thought to have even test drove a Susuki but when I did I was hooked. I knew that I was going to purchase the car. I have two kids and love the 3rd row seating. The storage is great.  It has a lot of pep and my husband likes the duel exhaust.  I really like the interior.  I love the red and white lights.  I actually like the window switches in the middle console.  I know some people in other reviews did not like that...to each their own.  I would at least recommend someone to test drive the Susuki XL7 before making a final purchase.
suzuki,xl7,2008,Melinda McCullough, 06/30/2009,Gas drinker,2,"I have had this car for two weeks and I have put  $130.00 in it driving just in town which is an average of 24 Miles per day. It evaporates the gas, took it in to Suzuki and they found nothing wrong. Saw another Lady at church and she asked me if my car drank allot of gas.I said yes,it does she said hers does as well. Same model and year 08 XL7. Needs to be built fuel economic. Uses to much gas. "
suzuki,xl7,2008,stacey, 07/17/2009,Waste of Money,2,This is the second Xl7 I have owned and I bought my current xl7 new in 2008. I have had it for a little over a year and it has been back to the dealership 7 times. There is something faulty with the gas cap and the check engine light will come on and stay on. To replace the air filter is $50 to replace the Hepa Filter is $72. The arm the helps fold the back seats down has come apart twice. Very dissappointed. I was going to trade it in and found out that the Kelly Blue book value is $9000 I paid $22000
suzuki,xl7,2008,kgnsam, 08/26/2009,Value SUV and functional,4,"This is our first Suzuki purchase and have not been disappointed with it. It excels in room, power and functionality.  Too bad Suzuki dropped it from their line up, some upgrades to the interior and better tires (bridgestone - above average noise) can make this an A+ buy.  Looks good on the outside and comfortable interior. Rear seats are not for adults, but perfect for little ones, specially in seat restraint. Audio system is standard GM, very average.  Mileage has been around 22.4 hwy and 14 in the city. "
suzuki,xl7,2008,bobbyjay, 09/04/2009,one of the best vehicles ever owned,5,"This is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned over my 50 years+ of driving  easy to drive very good petro mileage considering the size of the vehicle  the boot holds a great deal of luggage for holiday trips.  The instrument panel is very well laid out.  The bonnet has easy access.  The vehicle performed extremely well over our 4,600 mile trip.  I highly recommend this xl7  any gripes? yes; backing up the vehicle takes some getting used to. Really could use back-up sensors!"
suzuki,xl7,2008,Frank, 09/08/2009,decent suv for the price,4,"I picked up a used 2008 xl7 with 28000 miles for about 14,500 reviews were ok so i decided to buy it. So far the suv is pretty good i have a little complaint about a noise when you turn and a couple of little stuff but not major. Finish on this vehicle is not the best everything is plastic and feels cheap. But on the bright side it rides very well decent fuel economy (24) on the highway and for the price you cant beat it. "
suzuki,xl7,2008,EddysonBP, 10/19/2009,The real crossover for Suzuki,5,Stylish and drives like any other SUVs. Comfortable and reliable. I have been driving for a year now and never been tired or bored except of the air cutting thru.
suzuki,xl7,2008,Laurie, 11/21/2009,Entire Engine Replacement- big HASSLE,3,"We had the car for 1.5 yrs when the engine light came on and it started making noises (less than 12,000 miles).  Already been at the Suz. dealership for 5 days for repairs and now they tell me it needs an entire engine replacement which will take another 7 days.  So- 12 days w/out a car.  Since it's under 36000 miles, they'll pay $30/day for rental car for 5 days only-- but that won't fit  my 3 carseats (that's why I bought the 7 seater XL7)-- and minivan rentals are over $100 per day.  Big HASSLE for single mom w/3 kids.  Wish I bought that Honda/Toyota minivan or SUV after all.   Already has some other minor issues previously."
suzuki,xl7,2008,Stephanie, 02/24/2008,I love my XL7,5,I have mainly owned Toyotas.  Prior to the XL7 I had a Sienna XLE.  I loved that van and didn't think I would ever want a different vehicle.  When I had the opportunity to drive the XL7 for several days I knew that was the SUV for me.  I haven't been disappointed yet!!
suzuki,xl7,2008,westcoastcop, 03/11/2008,Suzuki hits a Home Run!,4,"We looked at the Mazda 9, very nice, looked at Honda Pilot/CRV and Toyota RAV and Highlander, and the Hyundai Santa Fe/Veracruz, nice also. But when you compare all of the features and standard stuff, the Suzuki really blows them away. Adding the no deductible, 7 year 100,000 mile warranty, free loan car, that covers exerything except the battery and tires! Even a burned out bulb is covered! Amazing. And the Japanese made GM motor is smooth and powerful, and all the safety stuff gets is a 5 star rating. "
suzuki,xl7,2008,KAS, 03/30/2008,What a bargain,5,Bought this for my wife who really wanted a Toyota. However the best deal we could find on a similar Toyota was 10K more and they offered 4K less on the trade in. For $14k less I talked her into the Suzuki. I have owned many new cars of about every make and never had one that didn't have anything that needed to be corrected in the first few months. That is until the XL7 absolutly everything was perfect.  My wife loves the vehicle.
suzuki,xl7,2008,Mark Johanson, 05/24/2008,Great 7 Seater Mid Size SUV,4,"A great value for a seven seater. The usable 2 extra back seats are great for kids yet even small adults. Plus the 2 extra seats have airbags so safety is considered (unlike other SUVs we compared) The inside design is basic and not all that stand-out yet functional. Has a very small front compartment which would be great if bigger. The back viewable area is poor due to the small windows, so I would highly recommend a back up camera system. The turning radius is large making it difficult to make tight turns like most SUVs. Safety features crash test rating are great as well as the warranty. This is probably the least expensive 7 seater mid-size SUV on the market and so far we love it."
suzuki,xl7,2008,Thomas Beck, 07/12/2019,More Than Satisfied,5,"I’m a new driver and I needed a reliable SUV with AWD to be able to survive an upstate New York winter, since I attend college there, so me and my family did some searching around. We came across an ‘08 XL7 with about 130k miles on it going for $4,000 and were kinda doubtful because of the high mileage. But my dad took it for a test drive and it was, in his words, “the best car on the lot.” He bought it and I finally drove it the next month after arriving home for winter break (and even after a month of not doing much it still felt great). It was such a smooth ride and it was quieter than what I expected from a V6. Maintenance isn’t super expensive on it which is perfect for my family’s financial situation, and other than a faulty alarm system where my remotes won’t work even though the batteries and circuit boards inside are fine (I’m sure this is a problem exclusive to my car so don’t let this ruin your first impression), it’s perfect for a first car. If you see one, don’t pass up the chance to test drive it – or dare I say – to buy it.

suzuki,xl7,2009,Adam, 03/22/2009,Why???,3,"I have a house in Colorado I use just about every long weekend or vacation I have. After years of renting a car and paying their fees, I decided to buy one. The idiot in me decided to buy a car over the internet and not test drive it. Unfortunately, it was the XL7. It had decent reviews online, a great warranty, it was cheap, and looked pretty good. But after 6,000, my thoughts have changed. The engine struggles around 65mph, and is full on panting at 70mph. The altitude may play a roll in this, but not that much. The car is put together well, but everything is a hard, hollow plastic. I get the MPG they say of around 17-19 Highway. Best Bet: if you are looking at a new car, get an Acadia"
suzuki,xl7,2009,MMoylan, 03/15/2010,Safe!,4,"I've only had positive experiences with this vehicle. It had a good, higher powered engine that was fun to drive and could accelerate faster than most similarly priced SUVs. Very smooth ride and great traction even in snow. Felt like you were riding on a cloud!  Stood out on the road with its unique lights and grill, too. Gas mileage left a little to be desired though.  The main purpose of this review is to praise the safety of the vehicle though. The car was broadsided during a left turn directly in the drivers door by a sedan going over 50 mph. The side air bags and door impact frames absorbed the blow completely. We were thankfully able to walk away with no damage whatsoever."
suzuki,xl7,2009,JBeninger, 08/23/2009,A lot of vehicle for the money,4,"I found this vehicle rides like a car and is very comfortable. I tow a 21'boat on a tandem trailer and love the self leveling shocks. The all wheel drive coupled with the manual shift feature covers a wide range of driving situations. The seven year 100,000 mile power train warranty provides long time peace of mind. The automatic ac works beautifully and was an extra not expected in a vehicle of this price. The ride and responsiveness is a joy and pleasure. One negative is the rear hatch visibility but I find the excellent side view mirrors make up for it."

fiat,124-spider,2017,Michael Lang, 04/03/2018,8 Months research and finally bought the ABARTH,5,"I had concerns over buying a FIAT. Lets face it, lemons are common but some get real good 500 ABARTHS that work well. The fact that Mazda was building the 124 inspired me to look past this. The car itself is 100 times more beautiful that the Miata version. My sticking points were ABARTHs comming to US had FIAT badge on wheel. As of March 2018 that has changed. Abarths now have proper abarth badging on the interior for 2018 but you have to look around as there are many older versions on lots. Next sticking point was that Miata's got the Retractable Fastback and FIAT's did not. What is more Italian that the RF top. Looks like the 70's Targa tops. Fiat could have branded it a Targa and they would not have been able to keep them in stock. I know all my friends were hoping for this as well. UGH! So I bought the ARARTH in Black. Wow the color is so deep and rich in the sunlight. Pictures do not do this car justice. Must see in person. My ABARTH is a bit rough in 1st gear for a manual. Been driving manuals all my life. This one I stalled 4 times on way home from dealer. The car wants to go. Low RPMs the car lags a bit and begs you to let it breath. There are two essential tweaks that fix this. One the DV+ diverter valve allows more low end and solves some issues with the cheap plastic diverter valve that comes from the factory which is either open or closed.... No in between. This DV+ also helps prevent turbo flutter which is potentially damaging buy allowing flow the turbo air flow back though the valve as the turbo winds down between shifts. Much healthier.. Second as the high pressure through the lines can bring with it some oil, it is good to add an oil catch can on these cars to reduce the amount of oil that can get back to the throttle and multiair unit which can be damaging over time. These two changes do help the car become more bullet proof. The car shifts great and has power.. Much more than the miata which I drove several times in my search trying to decide whether to drop the Fiat and just get the targa I love and deal with the angular futurist look of the miata rather than classic Italian beauty. I got the loaded version. I suggest just getting it with all options. Bose system is awesome, Navigation is easy. While touch is disabled when the car is moving, it is easy to manage shifting and using the dial to change channels etc. so the Tech in the car is great. Was able to save all my Sirius Channel Favs on way home from dealer lot. ABARTH sounds great in either Sport of Normal. Noted the Sport mode dials up the performance a bit which did feel more responsive. Im about 5 foot 10 inches tall and hover around 200 pounds and I fit comfortably in the car. If someone is over 6 foot they may find it cramped. I love the gauges and Abarth logos on seats and steering. It gives the car uniqueness and people have no clue what the car is when they see it which Scorpion badges all over it. I was asked at a gas station if it was a Ferarri. Lol I wish. Car takes corners like a champ and those Brembo Brakes really work well. I know that squirrel thanks FAIT for its life. Convertible top is same as Miata and is sooo easy to put up or take down. Chrysler and many aftermarket sites are selling a lot of after market upgrades so this car is very good if you want to make it a track car. But.. I only bought the two items i spoke of earlier. Abarth already has limited slip diff, Front and rear anti sway bars, Front and rear strut tower braces, Brembo brakes, and a killer sounding exhaust etc.. so its more performance than most people need. Im getting around 30 MPG average which totally surprised me. In summary, this car is more than I could have hoped for. I would like to see an aftermarket company make a targa top for this car but outside of that. Its my childhood dream of owning that Triumph TR7 or Fiat X 1/9 Bertone Targa car that I could never
 find married to modern day conveniences. I want to slap myself for even considering buying that Miata. I would have never forgiven myself. :) I am living my childhood dream of owning and driving a EURO roadster even if it is a Miata in Drag.

1.5 Years later: so it’s fall 2019 and I was asked to update my review: in the most true sense, I fully stand behind my Decision. I love Abarths 124Spider. I drive all the time in Sport mode. It handles, drives, turns, and responds like a light weight convertible sports car should. It gets great gas mileage even though I can’t keep my foot out of it.lol It has been very reliable and I still get head turns, shouts out windows etc. of how cool my car is. I also get many pretty young women slowing down to take a second look or flirting. So it’s a confidence boost. Lol No issues mechanically at all. Just oil changes and a tire rotation. I feel my research paid off as nobody is buying them. 20 years for now I may sell one at Mecum for a major profit as a rare car. I bought 2 of them so I will keep 1 till I die for sure.

fiat,124-spider,2017,Leo M, 12/11/2016,What a great ride!,5,"I purchased this Car November 19, 2016. Its a base model Lusso with no real upgrades. I have had an extended highway trip and several day trips and I have fallen in love with this car. I owned an 85 Fiat Spider 2000 and I am partial to the Italian styling evident in the body design. Needless to say the performance over the 85 model cannot be compared. The 1.4l turbo accelerates on demand and shifts smoothly up and down. I am using the Asin auto transmission. The road handling and cornering are sharp and responsive. Even so, its a smooth highway drive even on long trips. Its not the fastest 0-60 but it is quick. In my opinion, the base sound system is adequate for all but the most serious audio enthusiasts. I stream Pandora thru my phone and the sound is terrific once adjusted for treble, bass and balance. So my major positives are style and road handling. The only major drawbacks are leg room and trunk space. I am 6'1"" and I can fold my knees into a comfortable driving position, but there is not enough room for my big feet. Strangely, I have more than enough head room with the top up. If you have big feet there is limited room for the clutch, hence my selection of the auto trans. Any over 6'2"" will have difficulty driving this car and they will not fit in the passenger seat due to the trim located where the glove box should be. There is very limited storage space inside the passenger compartment. The trunk has enough room for two small duffel bags and a computer bag. That's fine for my use as a weekender car. Price point for base Lusso is very attractive. In my opinion, a lot of the extras in tech package are not necessary or worth the addt expense. Lastly, when people see it they will think its a Miata or they ask what it is. Personally, I do not think it looks that much like a Miata but there are not many on the road yet, so its understandable for mistake. its a great car for those looking for a fun weekender.

fiat,124-spider,2017,drbjaz, 08/08/2016,"After twelve months, we still love this car",5,"After twelve months of ownership, we're still in love with our FIAT 124 Spider. We've taken it on several road trips, some as long as six hours of driving and 400 miles in a day. For a roadster, the ride is excellent. We never feel tired, uncomfortable, or anxious for the ride to be over. It's awesome being able to enjoy the journey as much or more than the destination. For me, the Spider is the perfect blend of comfort, performance, and driving pleasure. Finding a nice twisting road through the mountains is pure joy. The handling is superb and the power is more than adequate to handle any situation whether it's climbing a steep grade or passing a slower vehicle. It stays planted in the curves and corners. The Spider has performed flawlessly with no problems of any kind.  My original review is in the paragraph below.

Realizing that a two seat roadster isn't for everyone, if you enjoy driving, or would like to enjoy it and have the luxury of being able to get by with just two seats, the FIAT 124 Spider is a great choice. Unless you just don't like driving, the FIAT Spider is sure to put a smile on your face and make you want to take the long way to wherever you're going. This car isn't a super-powered muscle car, but is light weight, nimble, peppy, and handles superbly. While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, for me, this car is gorgeous. Many sports cars are known for their harsh ride - not the FIAT. While providing great sporting performance, it also has a very comfortable and enjoyable ride with the top up or down. I'm 5'-8"" and the car fits me very well. I can imagine that someone over six-foot would feel a bit tight. I test drove both the automatic and the manual and concluded that, while both are really great, the manual provides an edge higher level of driver engagement and driving pleasure. But, upon the insistence of my wife, I purchased the auto. While I enjoyed the manual, I'm very pleased with the auto. It's great cruising on the open road where you're not shifting a lot anyway, and it's also less of a hassle in city traffic. I couldn't be more satisfied.

fiat,124-spider,2017,Marvin Goodpickle, 10/09/2017,"So far, so good!",5,"I haven't owned a ""roadster"" since I ditched my 2000 Miata back in 2011 because it was nickle and diming me to death. This 2017 Fiat Spider blew me away. I was seriously considering a Miata again, but after I read a pile of reviews and took several test drives, I was hooked on the Spider. (Plus the local Mazda dealer was jerking me around). Granted, Fiat skimped on the ""Mattel-made"" sun visors and the bland, colorless instrumentation (not even a red line on the tach), overall, it's very easy on the eyes, very well made, and with enough accoutrements or lack thereof to meet most-but not all-budgets. My main complaint is the noise at highway speeds. They indicate in their marketing that it's quieter than a Miata, but it's definitely more noisy than my 2000. The radio is pretty useless at highway speeds, unless you have a headset. At first, I was taken back by not having a spare, but I suppose the fix-the-flat stuff in the trunk will work OK. (Maybe I should read the directions before I need it...?). Oh yeah, and it's a blast to drive. For an aging grown-up, the fit is snug but comfortable, the steering and handling are great, and it has MORE than enough power to get me very quickly from point A to B in style without acquiring too many tickets-I hope!

fiat,124-spider,2017,Leslie Shopf, 12/22/2017,Fiat spider part 2,5,"I had a spyder 20+ years ago that was very fragile and had lots of problems. This car is 180 degrees from that. With the exception of the cup holders and glove box which are awkwardly placed, there is nothing I would change. I feel such joy and satisfaction every time I am in this car.  The only other problem, which the dealer is unable to fix, is that my tire inflation warning light comes on even when the tires are properly inflated.

fiat,124-spider,2017,Stelvio, 12/01/2016,This much fun has got to be illegal,5,"When looking for two seater, drop top roadsters, that capture the fun of driving a curvy, technical back road for a low price, you have a choice of a Miata (Mazda MX-5) or a ?. And Mazda does it well with a light weight, quick, well made and reliable car. But it's styling, for me, was like the rest of the car, superbly functional.  All it needed, was some passion to make it perfect and a little tuning by a culture with a rich road racing history.  Along comes Fiat, to bring it both.  The beautiful throw back looks of the 124 Sport Abarth, added to the MX-5 would have made a great car inspiring, and the looks distinctive, but it would still not be a Italian sports car but rather a better looking Mazda.  But Fiat ripped the heart out of the Miata by replacing its engine with the soul of an Italian. Now it has it own looks and the totally different driving experience that a turbo charged motor brings to a car.  But what about that tuning?  That is where the Abarth model's unique features come in .  The Bilstein shocks added to the front and rear, revised roll stabilizers, limited slip differential, 17 inch wheels with 205 low profile tires, the revised more throaty exhaust that adds four horsepower, - combine to allow the engine, suspension, and even the steering to be dialed in with the sport mode button to transform the 124 from a gentleman's sporting vehicle into a superbly controlled, feisty, canyon carver expert that blows the top off the fun driving chart. This car feels like it is nailed to the pavement no matter the road surface or the severity of the curves.  Add the Brembo brake option as I did, and you can bring down your boiling cup of espresso to a standstill in a heart beat. Put it all together, as Fiat has, and this is the most fun you can have for a $25 tank of gas that will take you 350 fun (did I mention it was fun?) filled miles..  I have only known her for 1000 miles so far, but I can tell you already that if it were possible to marry this car, I would.

fiat,124-spider,2017,Sunny FL. Why does anyone live north of NC??, 03/17/2017,Fantastic Car!,5,"2017 Fiat Spider 124 Abarth, manual with brembo brake pkg.  It is such a joy to drive.  Handles fantastic, beautiful interior, beautiful looking car outside and inside. Love the hood and design of the car.  I owned a 95' 325I for about 9 years, (very good car), and a 2006 330I for about 2 years.  The 330I cost a lot of money in repairs.  I wanted to purchase a 2014 Cayman S but the price of admission for a nicely optioned used one is about $50,000.  I test drove the Fiat Spider and for $31,700 brand new it was a no brainer.  Plus the Spider comes with 4 year 50,000 warranty vs 3 year 36,000 for the Miata.  I still would like to get a Cayman someday (but would like to keep the Spider as a second car) but for now I couldn't be happier with my decision.  I look forward to driving the car everyday.  I'm 6' 1"" and fit comfortably but it would be nice to have about 1 more inch of room so I could get the seat back a bit further ( I also wish the Cayman seat went back about one inch further).  That's why I gave it a 4 star out of 5 for comfort. I test drove the Fiat and then went and test drove the Miata the same day.  The Mazda Club with brembo brakes you can get for about $30,000 and the Spider Abarth is about $31,700 plus tax.  You can't go wrong with either car.  I believe the Mazda handles a little better and is a bit faster.  But for my everyday driving the Spider is just perfect.  It just came down to personal taste.  The clincher being Japanese build quality with Italian styling.  I like the alcantara seat fabric and the Recaro seats.  Plus the quad tail pipes.  They sound great in 1st and second gear but I wish they were louder as you go through the gears.  I love both cars but just liked the looks a little better of the Spider.  If you want wheel locks so some clown doesn't steel your wheels you can get them from the Mazda parts dept. for about $59 or order them online from Good-Win-Racing.com part # 61-1057F for about $99.00.  After reading the comments about the goodwinracing wheel locks I opted for those.  Don't think you can go wrong either choice.  Happy motoring.  And do your self a huge favor, regardless of what your wife or parents or friends say, make sure you get the manual...  Shifting gears is half the fun of owning the car. 

One year ownership update.  I have put 13,300 miles on the car.  Zero maintenance issues.   Car has been fantastic and dependable.   Took in for scheduled maintenance one time for 72.00.  It's a great car.

fiat,124-spider,2017,Wilson P, 10/10/2016,Fun Is All There,5,"My previous sports cars include a Porsche Boxster, a BMW M235, an RX-8, and three editions of the Mazda Miata from 2006, 2010 and 2013. I mention that history because the 124 Spider from Fiat is the least expensive ( i paid right at $28K) and in my opinion, the best looking of them all. You might know that Fiat and Mazda joined forces to build this car and the Fiat style and Mazda reliability are a winning combination for me.  None of the Mazda Miata cars required more than oil changes and standard maintenance. Nothing ever went wrong with those cars. I hope the Fiat does that well. If you are a six footer the car might not be as comfortable and the attractive  interior is close at hand. The car is very drivable and steers, brakes and handles well. When most cars slow for turns, i speed up (a little) and the Spider really shows its moxie in corners. Gas prices may not stay this low but i can fill up with premium fuel for about $25. I think people who live in warmer climates or want a fun weekend ride will love this car. The more you like to drive, the more it will appeal to you. Its about as much fun as you can have for not a lot of cash.

fiat,124-spider,2017,Glenn Welt, 09/06/2016,"Better than $55,000 Mercedes",5,"Until August 2, 2016 I was ready to buy a 2017 Mercedes SLC300 via European delivery. Then I realized that I'd be paying $55K in advance for a car that wouldn't be in my home driveway for 6 months or more. Just to be sure I was making the right choice, i googled ""2017 convertibles"" and suddenly saw a pic of a car I'd never seen before.  Having done a test drive in a Mercedes, I was impressed with the quiet ride at 70mph on a freeway with top down. I was able to converse with the salesman at normal volume. One thing that totally UN-impressed me was that to start the newest Mercedes you MUST put a key in the ignition!  Within 48 hours of my Mercedes test drive, I was cruising in a 2017 Fiat 124 Spider which seemed just as quiet on the highway and has push-button start. When I started comparing the overall specs of both cars, the new body styling of the 124 Spider and at HALF the price of the Mercedes, it became a VERY easy decision. As the former owner of 2 Porsche, Lotus Esprit, 3 Mercedes SL convertibles and a Rolls, after a month driving my new 2017 Spider I am VERY happy with my choice!

3 MONTHS LATER ... I now have just over 1,000 miles on my FERRARI 124. FIAT owns Ferrari which gave me an idea. I removed or covered ALL the FIAT emblems and now drive the ONE and ONLY car that passes for a Ferrari (yes people believe the emblems they see) but costs about 1/8 the price! I even got a Nevada vanity license plate that says NICECAR so if I pass you in a flash and you see the tag, good luck catching me! BOTTOM LINE: Not since my Porsche racing days have I had so much fun behind the wheel of ANY car, regardless of the price !!!

fiat,124-spider,2017,Mark, 06/10/2017,Bloody GORGEOUS!,4,"I have been gagging for this car since Fiat/ Mazda bought it to my attention. It has taken me months to drill down and get the car I wanted. All I ever found on my search was automatics!!! ( I love driving and the thought of an automatic is just sacrilege in my opinion) Of course it had to be red, and I opted for the luxury package which is totally worth it especially the LED lights and their capacity to light the road ahead at night. Just outstanding. Its GORGEOUS from every angle. Driving it is a pleasure. Love the torque and relaxed nature of the engine. Would prefer the exhaust a little louder (I have the 500 Abarth and its a mean sounding, just beautiful chorus which is subdued in the 124) Was surprised Fiat didn't option it with the flat bottomed steering wheel that they have in the 500 which is a tactile pleasure, but none the less, it does feel good in the hands along with the shifter and short throws. Italian cars really do it for me, they connect me emotionally which is lacking in other cars. Mazda and Fiat have done a wonderful job and I hope it pays big dividends for them. Would like a boost gauge and cooled seats as the leather gets really hot during the summer. Update: Love the car, loathe the dealership experience which has now closed with no notification! Seems Fiat are pulling out of the USA. Communication is abismal. The car gets 5 stars, the dealership experience zero stars.

fiat,124-spider,2017,PHXSun, 05/23/2019,Best Bang for Buck Sports Car/Roadster on the Mkt,5,"Most fun car I have ever owned, 54 yo, and like this car more now than when I bought it two years ago. Zero problems, great reliability up to now. Bought the Abarth version, love the sports mode, paddle shifters and interior. Everybody asks about this car, literally every time I take it out. Lots of little upgrades I made just improved the look, mainly red accents inside and outside the car (pearl white exterior). You can tell it was styled in Italy, interior is nicer than cars costing $75k. Provides the true roadster experience. Top comes down or up in less than 3 seconds! Low to the ground, 50/50 weight balance provides for great handling and braking. Only main fault is some turbo lag going from 0 to 30 mph. Sports mode and paddle shifters in Abarth version compensates for some of this. Best--hardly any on the road, I have seen two versions of my car since owning it. Interior has simple to use controls and seats are great. Noise reduction throughout so long drives are comfortable. Best bang for buck sports car/roadster on the market.

fiat,124-spider,2017,Alan, 04/29/2017,Wow Love driving this car!,5,"I haven't had this much fun driving a car since I owned a 1982 Nissan 280 Z back in the 80's I love the handling and the way it corners I have the Abarth model and I just love the exhaust rumble the second you start it. The car is just amazing to look at and the convertible top is quick and easy to put it up or back down! I do wish there was little more storage in the interior I don't mind the smallish trunk its big enough for two weekend bags! I can't wait until I get back in it to drive again like right now instead of typing this review!  Update:  after driving it for 6 months all I can say is I love it more than ever I have had ZERO  problems not even a glitch I now store it for our harsh northern winter and really cant wait until next spring to be driving this awesome car again!

UPDATE:  My Fiat Spider Abarth is better than I could ever hoped to imagine I have no regrets on my purchase and I have had had 0 problems after 8500 miles! It is now stored for the winter and I can not wait until spring to be behind the wheel again!

I have driven quite a while I was a little disappointed that at 15,000 miles  I had to have a heater hose replaced after discovering a puddle of coolant under my Fiat. The deal had the car for 6 days before retuning it so I am surprised that I would need work with 15,000 miles on it I had 5 months left on my Warranty otherwise it would have cost me 660.00 dollars!

fiat,124-spider,2017,Harry, 11/10/2017,Fun drive/eye-catching ride not w/o minor glitches,4,"This vehicle is a lot of fun to drive and great to look at inside and out!  The seats are comfortable but a tight fit with just enough leg room for an average size person.  If you are really tall or maybe a little rotund, you are out of luck if you want to drive this car!  After driving this little convertible sports roadster over 4,600 miles, I have had a lot of smiles on my face but also a couple of frowns.  My vehicle came equipped with high performance three season tires which do perform very well when the temperature is above 40 deg. F, but if you live where winter temperatures dip below 40, you have to switch out these tires for all-season or snow tires... an extra expense.  Otherwise, it must be garaged during very cold wintry days.  I replaced the factory equipped tires with high performance all-season tires and they have performed very well for me even in the cold winter months.   Also, the instrument panel's outdoor temperature display at any outside temperatures is pretty much a joke.  It's response is very, very slow and you have to maintain a minimum speed for an extended period of time for it to properly function.  (First update: The response of the outside temperature display seems to be better in the warmer months than the colder months. Second update 11/17/19: For whatever reason, the outside temperature display now seems to be more responsive even in the colder months.)  Finally, sometimes the automatic transmission is slow to shift but you do have the option to manually shift but no shift paddles on the Lusso trim.

fiat,124-spider,2017,Graeme Robinson, 06/12/2017,Permanent grin since the day I brought it home,5,"If your idea of performance is based on quarter mile times, this isn't the car for you. If, on the other hand, carving through canyon or mountain roads is your thing, there may not be anything else on sale at any price that can put as big a grin on your face as this Fiat. Its suspension is better sorted than the MX-5 (less roll, less bumping up against the bump stops) and it has all the power you can realistically use on public roads. It also looks - to my eyes anyway - a more mature / elegant design than the Mazda. This is my third Fiat and - despite the reputation - I've never had a problem with any of them.

Only caveat is that if you're more than 6' tall or over 200lbs, definitely spend some extended time in one before committing to the purchase as it is a tight fit.

fiat,124-spider,2017,AnClar, 06/15/2017,Tons of Fun At a Great Price,5,"I've owned a couple of 2-seat roadsters...a 2004 Porsche Boxster, and my 2017 Fiat 124 Spider Abarth.  The Boxster, at close to $60,000 was one of the best pure driver's cars I've ever driven.  That said, for half the price of the Porsche, I get 95% of the driving fun with my Abarth Spider.  I've had the car for about 6 months now...it was one of the first Abarths delivered in my area.  So far, with almost 5,000 miles on it, it has been pure enjoyment.  Since neither my wife nor I are particularly large people we find the cockpit of the Abarth more than comfortable, even on long rides.  The fit and finish is beautiful...ours is pearl white with the black leather interior...it turns heads wherever we go.  I've had many people ask what the car was and have gotten nothing but compliments from everyone.  I'm really glad we got the Abarth...the upgrades are worth it, and make all the driving difference.  The Abarth's quad exhaust has a much nicer note than the Lusso or Classica.  Not that they are bad...just a bit quieter than I like.  The biggest difference is the Sport mode selector on the automatic transmission.  Since my wife opted for the auto, the paddle shifters on the Abarth are a good compromise.  Also in Sport mode, the shifts are much sharper, and responsive.  Overall, this car is a winner for us...great looking, fun to drive, and a great value for the money.  If you're in the market for a great 2-seat roadster, give this one a long look...odds are you won't be disappointed!

2 1/2 year update:  We've owned our 2017 Abarth Spider for 2 1/2 years and the car's been great!  The only issue we've had was a bad thermostat which was replaced under warranty a year and a half ago.  No other issues, just a lot of fun driving.  The car has been everything we expected and more.  I'd buy the car again in a heartbeat!

You get looks and comments from little kids, middle aged wives, and grandfathers. Everybody looks the looks of this Italian sweet heart. But an unsolvable problem plagues this beauty. My 124 spider Abarth's alarm has gone off randomly while driving. I drove her for a few months and it went off numerous times driving under various conditions

fiat,124-spider,2017,Bo, 06/20/2017,2017 Fiat Lusso 6auto,5,"First off, this car is 75 to 80% Mazda Miata. However, the similarity ends there. The car has a longer nose and much better styling in my opinion.  The Fiat sounds and feels like a sports car.  The 6 speed auto is a Aisen product, which gives the car the ability to shift even faster than a 6 speed manual.  To be fair, the 6 speed auto is enough if you travel the daily freeway commute like me. While I have had the car for less than a week, my sportscar past is not nill.  My father owned a 1988 Mazda RX7 convertible. While the RX7 could take a corner without effort,  the Fiat still does the same but is a bit nose heavy. Why? The Fiat's engine is an iron block, placing more weight over the front wheels.  Yet,  the car takes the corners well.  I am still enjoying my commute, even though I had to give up a Prius Plug-in that gets 50-60 mpg and a free ride in the CA HOV lane.  Who cares, really when the Fiat is much more fun to drive and gets 31mpg on average.  It's your call, but why waste money on a more expensive BMW or Mercedes when you can get an excellent roadster out of the Fiat 124 Spider Lusso.  Have had the car now for six months with no issues.

Still no major issues at 30k. Runs strong. 

At, 50k miles and over 3 years old, still running great! The old Fit It Again Tony myth no longer applies to this car. Mazda built next to the MX5 Miata cousin and most parts are sourced from the MAZDA bin. A good deal if you are not taller than 6 feet and want a fun convertible. Much better mileage than a Mustang or Camaro convertible!

fiat,124-spider,2017,The Virginian, 10/08/2019,Under-rated head turner,5,"We bought a bare-bones 2017 Classica Manual Transmission 124 Spider a month ago. I'm 6'1"" and while it's tight to get into the driver's seat, once I'm there I don't want to leave. This is the most fun I've ever had behind the wheel, and it's become a daily car. We live in Hill Country and our commute is entirely on back roads with serious curves: this vehicle was made for our driving needs. Get the six-speed manual transmission: the gear box is tight, it wants to rev high anyway, and hey that's why you're buying a roadster to begin with. 

It's more quick than fast, as the 160 hp engine and high torque combines with the light weight to zip you around those turns tightly. It's fine on the highway too, and quieter than the Miata with the top down. 

Others have commented on its looks, and I concur: I don't like the Miata's snub-nosed design and feel cramped inside it. The FIAT's proportions work better on it and I think it looks much, much better than the tiny Miata. 

Edmunds for some reason gives the Miata a 7.9 and the Fiat a 6.4, even though they both have the same flaws - but the Fiat has more trunk space, a quieter cabin, and more power in the engine, so the difference in rating is not fair in my book: the Fiat is a slightly better car if you ask me and Edmunds needs to reevaluate it by test-driving a manual transmission (rather than the automatic they reviewed). I love this car!
"
fiat,124-spider,2017,T P G, 09/17/2017,Great sporty car for life in the CA desert,5,"The more appealing look of this car compared to the Miata sold me on it.  I'm over 6 feet tall, and can't put the seat all the way back and fully depress the clutch.  While not roomy, the cabin isn't as small as professional reviewers would lead you to believe, with a surprisingly comfortable ride given the short wheelbase.  It's a bit of a drop to get in, as the car sits low to the ground, but the seat side bolster doesn't hinder access.  Exiting the car is much easier if you're able to open the door fully, as it swings out very wide.  The instruments are easy to read and well lit at night.  When the top is up, there are two pronounced blind spots behind the driver.  If this concerns you, opt for the version with parking sensors, etc.  The radio is nothing terrific, but again, it's much better than I anticipated.  Choose the larger radio touchscreen if your eyesight needs assistance.  Premium gas is recommended, but not required.  So far, I am perfectly happy with my Rosso Classica with Technology Package.

fiat,124-spider,2017,Keane, 08/19/2017,Overpriced Miata with fiat reliability,1,"2019: car was sent back to fiat as a lemon and replaced with a used Porsche still with warranty for almost the same price. Best move you can make, just ditch fiat. 


It spends a lot of time in the shop waiting for parts; like months waiting for simple parts (wish that was an exaggeration). The car looks amazing and the Abarth exhaust sounds fantastic. If you're looking for a daily driver that is fun to drive short distances, this is the car for you. It's also the car you need if you enjoy mini-vans and most every other car pulling away from you at their normal pace (unless you put the pedal down and rev the engine like crazy to catch up). It's not a fast car and all the commercials showing it blazing away are pretty much lies. With some modifications it can be pretty quick, but the stock version is asthmatic.  The main issue with this car is quality. After waiting over 2 months for one part, I filed for lemon status on it and was approved (easy in CA), so Fiat is buying it back and hopefully scrapping it to make some useful toasters. Love the idea of this car, but Fiat just can't make a quality car (a very large % of the owners are experiencing parts problems), even when this is mostly a miata. The stock is VERY limited, but don't let that get used to justify overpaying for this Frankenstein (Base abarth with Automatic for 30k out the door, including all taxes/tags/etc...). It's a unique take on the miata, but I'd stay away from the 2017 version of this car (maybe Fiat will get their act together in 2018). After 9 months, my car has less than 4000 miles, mainly due to having driven the complimentary rental cars for a good portion of the year.

Update 2019: 7 months of rental cars before fiat was forced to pay me back for it. For cheaper than this car I got a Porsche boxater with a year of warranty left. That makes up for buying a fiat. :)

Will update if I have any changes based on further experience. Very cool car and it seems like about $3000 discount over a comparable Miata. The engine is more useful in daily driving due to the mid line torque but i can also understand that the Miata engine would probably be more rewarding to flog to redline.

But after the test drive, I decided to test-drive a Spider at the dealer down the road. To me, it was more refined, inside and out. The ride felt more comfortable as well, and the steering was quick and true. When you gave it the gas and the turbo kicks in, it really gives you a thrill. I'm going on 3,000 miles, with my Classica, and it's still a joy to throw the top down and go for a spin (trouble-free). It's like a go-kart for grown-ups, with a rocket on the back!

Update at 8500 miles. Absolutely perfect! Getting right at 31 mph with mostly city driving. Put new Autoricambi exhaust on it because it was so quiet I kept forgetting to change gears. The new muffler-delete pipes are great! Great balls of fun!

"
fiat,124-spider,2018,Brian, 03/19/2018,Test drove this and an Mazda MX5,4,"I test drove both the Fiat and the Miata.  The Miata delivers its power in a more linear fashion.  The Fiat needs to get up in the Revs before it really goes.  So, it feels slower off the line.  A little more like a Honda S2000.  So it is really down to which one appeals to you more.  I would rate the Fiat at a 4 and the Mazda at a 4.5 from an everyday driving standpoint.  However, I am considering this purchase for weekend pleasure drives and I find the Fiat is more exciting to me.  I like the bit of quirkiness that it has over the Miata.  To me this gives the Fiat a bit more excitement.  If you are deciding between the Mazda and the Fiat you really need to spend some drive time in both.  The interior is similar in most ways.  It's really about do you fit and are you comfortable enough to enjoy the car.  Also, I would mention that the edmunds review of the Fiat is a 3 and the Mazda a 4.5.  This seems to me to be because of different editors approach to the car and because the Fiat review, I believe, is for the automatic which I agree is not very good with this engine.  If you want an auto the Mazda is the better choice.  I took a brief drive of each car with the auto but for me the manual is the way to go.  I would recommend reading each edmunds review with the mindset that it applies to both cars outside of the engine.  I am disappointed that Edmunds editors seem to have written these reviews in a vacuum ignoring the relation of the cars to each other.

Great soft top with added sound deadening to make for a quiet interior when needed.

Safety package is a great add to the Lusso.Can’t say enough about the way this car drives.

I test drove the miata for comparison. Both cars were great. I found the styling and road handling superior in the FIAT. I did test drive the automatic and do not recommend the automatic. It is a true sports car and needs the manual for the max enjoyment. I live in the Hudson valley of New York and we have many great sports car roads. It handles the curves and hills like the true sports car it is. Great curb appeal. I get many people commenting on the car's beauty. Mine is red with the tan interior.

fiat,124-spider,2018,Tazilon, 12/29/2018,Edmund's Bias is Showing.,5,"UPDATED AFTER 24 MONTHS AND 25,000 MILES OF OWNERSHIP:  Edmund's own reviewers praise the Miata MX-5 but take the Fiat 124 Spider to task for noise, cargo space, and comfort.   The truth is, the Spider is better at dampening noise, has a slightly larger trunk than the Miata, and has the exact same headroom and legroom as the MX-5 and more headroom than the MX-5 RF.  The MX-5 has better low end acceleration, but the Spider has better at speed.  I can't speak for the automatic 124s but the manual tranny is more than adequate at low end; it just isn't quite as fast off the line as a MX-5.  And once you spin the turbo up, the thing leaps from gear to gear in an exhilarating rush.  Roadsters are definitely not for everyone; they wrap around your body like a glove and rank only slightly higher than a tricycle on a utilitarian scale, but man, are they FUN to drive.  The 124 Spider captures the joy of driving well.  It gives you excellent feedback, handles well, has a great little shifter, and looks awesome to boot.  How well do they handle?  fastestlaps rates the Abarth at 1.10g on the skidpad - tied with cars like the Ferrari P488 Pista and Lambo Aventador.  The Classica and Lusso are rated at 1.09g, tied with some models of the Porsche 911 and McLaren 720S! The drop top goes up and down easily.  And because it is no where near as common as a Miata (or any other roadster), it gets looks and comments everywhere we go.  I highly recommend this car for anyone looking to experience the true joy of driving.  UPDATE:  After 24 months of ownership and 25,000 miles, I stand by everything above.  The car still gets comments constantly, and continually provides driving smiles. ""A smile a minute, whenever you're in it!"" For you taller people, a friend in a 124 Car Club is 6'3"" and fits inside.

UPDATE:  We have now owned our 124 for slightly over a year and have put slightly over 12,000 fun filled miles on it, including several weekend getaways.  We have had 0 maintenance issues with the car.   It has been a blast to own and drive.  It constantly gets remarks from passersby.  If you are in the market for a small, fun to drive car, I can not recommend the 124 Spider enough.

UPDATE:  After 19 months of ownership and 18,000 miles:  We have had ZERO issues with the car.  Well, not exactly true as we still sometimes struggle to find plausible reasons to take it out for yet another drive every day. PRO TIP:  If you ""accidently"" forget something at the store when you go, you get to go again - and take the long way, too. Seriously though, the 124 Spider is one of the most under-rated car values in the US marketplace today.

"
fiat,124-spider,2018,Tony, 01/08/2019,Very impressed!,5,"Update after 12 months per request from Edmunds-  The car continues to break in and now is much different and better than when I bought it. The exhaust sounds keeps getting better and engine performance has improved. Professional Reviewers would have a better viewpoint if they drove one that is broken in. Still is rock solid, not a single issue. The Recaro seats are very comfortable but it is still a tight cabin. I’m 5;8’ so it is fits me perfectly. I keep my cars in an air conditioned garage so that makes them better so that may help how this performs. I love this thing. My local Fiat dealer just closed so we have to wonder how long Fiat is for the USA. Thus, I’m glad I got this car while it is available. I also see some fully loaded Abarth versios that are very depreciated with very low miles so they are a steal for anyone. But because it seems Fiat in the USA is going away perhaps these will be harder to come by in the future so I’m glad I have one. This version is still very rare to see so it is nice to be driving something that is very different. 

Original review-

I’ve now owned and driven this car for 6 months. First of all this car is a blast to drive. I’ve owned a variety of sports cars and this car is a fun as any of them but more beautiful than almost anything out there. I have to pause every time I walk up to it. What a design job!  Pictures of it don’t do it justice. It is odd how in person the nose looks much longer, bolder and sexier than any photos-I don’t know how that happens. 

Also, this car is rock solid. I didn’t expect that but I’ve also owned a Tacoma and this car feels as solid as that, which doesn’t seem to make sense. Absolutely nothing has failed on it so build quality seems very high which I wasn’t sure of when I bought it. 

 I rate the comfort high given what it is- a roadster. The top level trim seats are very comfortable. However, I don’t think the car is made for 4 hour drives. It is made for shorter drives or mountain foothills (l live on a curvy foothill) but I use it whenever I can for around town because it is simply so much fun to drive. I rated performance a 4/5 because it is true it could have more power but it is plenty for my needs. You can probably pass almost anyone if you want. The engine sound is fantastic. It took 2-3000 miles to break in but now broken in it it even more fun. It seems this car is a secret because it took me 6 months to see another one on the road and I live close to a Fiat dealer.

I look for any excuse to take my car out for a spin. I was looking for acceleration. It gets you passed other vehicles easily and does feel like you are going faster than you actually are.  Getting in and out of the car is much easier with door wide open, so consider where you park. I average 31-32 mpg on 89 or 91 fuel. Five full bags of groceries fit in the trunk.

I wanted a simple sports car that was fun to drive and had a decent clutch and 5 or 6 speed transmission with recaro seats and bun-warmers for starting out on cold days.  A good stereo was also on my list as well as bright headlights.  This thing met all those requirements and was available with adaptive headlights + a Bose 7 speaker stereo.  It has a good cruise control and I use it for a daily driver.  Will keep it, like all my cars, until I tire of looking at it - that is usually about 25 years.

Chose the Spider over the Miata MX5 entirely because of its retro body style (owned an Alfa in the 80's).  Someone tapped the rear end and had to take the car to Fiat (Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep, Ram) and Mazda dealer for body work.  When called to pick up the vehicle the repair work looked great (just a bumper cover and spoiler replacement) but key fobs no longer worked.  Dealer 'reprogrammed' (he claimed) but still did not work.  5 or 6 visits (including 2+ weeks in a dealer provided rental) the shop still has not rectified the problem.  They really can't figure out just what they have done to it.   Every time I have taken it in it comes back NOT repaired and w/ more problems (interior light/trunk light/avg MPG no longer works after visit before last).  I think the body shop left something unplugged but service is claiming some radio frequency hub.  Not satisfied at all w/ dealer.  Had to file GA Lemon Law hoping this will encourage somebody to rectify the problem.  I JUST WANT MY CAR back and in working order.  I'd buy another......my car is NOT a lemon - just the clowns working on it are a bit inept.  6 weeks into all this, btw.

The head-turning body styling screams ""Forza Italia!!!"" and the convertible is actually well insulated and easy to operate.  The acceleration, while not jarring, is brisk especially when in ""Sport Mode"".  And quite frankly, when the top is down, I really don't want to go too fast because I like to be seen in it.  And the Abarth trim exhaust has a wonderful throaty sound to it.  The Brembo brake option is wonderful. The Navigation option includes the Bose audio system and the headrest speakers; I'm glad chose it. The vehicle is very tight for a convertible, especially at this price, and the ride very comfortable. The 70% base Mazda gives me the feeling of reliability and craftsmanship and the 30% Fiat has added speaks to me of class, refinement and sexiness. And that for me is a perfect combination.

The Bose sound system is so much fun and loud enough cruising down the road with the top down.  I find the wind to be just right and just drove a 400 mile road trip from siesta key to my daughter's college in pure happiness. If you want something fun to drive, enjoy turning heads, driving something different from most cars driving by for a surprisingly fair price take one out for a test drive.

fiat,124-spider,2019,Jackson C., 03/28/2019,I love this car!,5,"We have an old Fiat 124 and always wanted a new one if they made one again.  What a great car this is. it is peppy and agile. It holds the road like nobody’s business. It have a great manual transmission and is a joy to drive. It is also just beautiful to look at. It is a fitting heir to our old 124. You will have a hard time finding a better roadster for the money!

fiat,124-spider,2019,TomBarnard1, 08/02/2019,Upgraded to a Fiat from a Porsche,5,"I owned and daily drove my Porsche Boxster for 6 years and loved the car. What I didn't love was the price of maintenance, parts, tires, and brakes. The Porsche was a great car, don't get me wrong, but with a Porsche, you are paying for the ability to do 165 mph and everything in the car is designed to that ability (meaning spec tires, brakes, etc. are $$$). And in six years of ownership, I took the car into triple digits only one single time. I paid those prices for a capability I'm never going to use. 

Meanwhile, this little 124 gives me just as much fun driving dynamic at speeds that won't land me in jail. And the expected maintenance costs should be next to nothing given so much of it under the skin is Mazda. It's nice to not have to spend so much energy worrying about my car ending up costing me more than I can afford to repair. 

One last thought. Before I owned my Porsche, I drove a Honda S2000. I never thought I'd drive a car with a manual transmission as enjoyable as the S2000. This Fiat comes really close. This is one of the best sticks I've ever driven at any price.

A couple dozen more horsepower would be nice but it makes up for it with it's cornering ability. My only real complaint is the lack of a telescoping steering column. 

2 year update......
Still absolutely love this car. Still get a ton of questions and compliments about it. The top had to be replaced after 25k miles due to a sagging headliner.  Was covered under warranty. Now, after an additional 5I miles, it needs replaced again for the same reason. Other than that, the only other issue is with the leather on the corner of the driver's seat. It has not worn well but should be covered under warranty as well.

fiat,124-spider,2020,ConundrumIV, 02/08/2020,Best kept secret,5,"1) The 6 speed manual is from the NC Mazda MX-5 Miata.
2) The only thing not Mazda is the Auto transmission and engine.
3) Its built by Mazda on the same assembly line as the ND MX-5 Miata.
4) Interior is more upscale than the ND MX-5 Miata. (Soft touch rubber, not hard plastic like the Miata)
5) A simple software flash and you have close if not over 200 hp.
6) Bought my 2017 for $18,000 with 2000 miles on it 3 years ago.
7) Better looking than Miata. 
8) Handles amazing!! (I've owned 6 miatas and still have a 94) 
9)Deeply discounted units can be had for thousands below retail.
10) No wind noise from window in your ear like the Miata. 
11) No problems or issues. 
12) Highly recommended!!! And I'm a 35 year Miata guy. 
Original NA 90-97 Miata still the best out there in my opinion. The Fiat 124 Spider is what the original NA Miata should have progressed into.

Brembo brakes,,,,,,European, seats Abarth manufactured and installed, upper strut bar, Abarth manufactured and installed,, sway bars Abarth manufactured and installed. The car is built own a Mazda chassis, arguably the best and lightest roadster chassis in the world. The rest of the car ? LOADED with high performance Italian components. And as for the body work. Sorry but the Pininfarina body work beats the Japanese sheet metal for looks and excitement. By far...chip this motor and put in a Goodwin exhaust and a Madness cold air intake and Diverter valve and you have rocket ship that will SMOKE a Miata w/o blinking.

fiat,124-spider,2020,Christopher Bradford, 09/02/2020,What a Blast to Drive!,5,"The 124 Abarth Spider is so much fun to drive!  Switch it in Sport mode and the 1.4 liter turbo takes off like a rocket.  It takes corners tight and and narrow. The 6 speed manual transmission is wonderful; short throw and solid feel.  For the money, this car is amazing!  My only issue is that it takes a bit of effort to enter and exit the cockpit, but once you’re in it fits like a glove with very comfortable microfiber and leather seats.  Interior storage is sparse (no map pockets) except for the generous locking glovebox between the seats. Overall it’s a blast to drive!

The suspension with Recaro seats is like a go cart around turns. It is seriously fun. For extra fun, get the Monza exhaust, it’s better to listen to than satellite or the radio. Did I say it turns heads? Get the heritage stripe. It is a matte black and cool to look at, especially in a white color model. This car will be a collector. I have youth turning heads, and if history proves to be true, this model will be a desirable ride now and 30 years from now.
"
fiat,124-spider,2020,Roth, 11/10/2020,What a head turner,5,"What is great-Hands down the drive is the BEST. This car is so much fun. Rarely a day passes when I am not asked what it is. The ride is surprisingly good for such a small car and being low to the ground. The exhaust package sounds great! Occasionally you get a mini backfire and it makes me smile. Fit and finish is very good. The top operation is so simple, flawless, and quick. The microphone is surprisingly accurate and head rest speakers are a big plus.

What is good (but could be better)-Overall the six speed is extremely smooth, occasionally downshifting to first can be difficult. Engine oil with the correct certifications can be difficult to find. Lastly the car has plenty of power, unfortunately it is not distributed evenly. So you will need more gas to get going than what you would expect. The Bose sound system is plenty loud, but the sound quality is sadly flat and the Bose system dont not have speed sensitive sound (that actually works).

What needs improvement- The technology in the car feels dated. Here are some examples: The Infotainment system and navigation can be a little slow.  Key-less entry requires a physical button press on the handle, rather than simply unlocking when you grab the door. Backup camera resolution is is not great or maybe it is the screen. Lane departure system is not an option. Windows lack auto up switch. Lastly, although it is quieter than the Miata, there is a lot of noise at highway speeds.

Overall I have absolutely no regrets. I enjoy this car every single day. I have no doubt I will own this car until it falls a part.

fiat,500,2012,jchasp59, 03/01/2012,Open Body Seams During Manufacture,3,"I bought my new, 2012 Fiat 500 Pop on 12/22/2011.
Three days after purchase, I noticed an interior water leak and returned the car to the dealer. The dealer found that the cause of the leaks were, ""body seams that were left open, unwelded and unpainted during manufacture.""
 Got the car back after 23 days in the shop.
That day, I noticed electrical problems and that the leak wasn't repaired. Returned it to the shop More open body seams were found around the windshield. I requested a replacement. Fiat agreed. The dealership acquired my replacement on 02/10/2012, but has yet to get it to me (03/01). My Fiat Case Manager is Kathy Nelson, but I have no way to contact her. I regret my purchase."
fiat,500,2012,N.L., 11/29/2015,I'm not sure if my story will have a happy ending,3,"As I write this, my car currently has just over 52,000 miles on it and just recently came off of warranty. It's a 2012 Pop 500, which is now three years old. Last January, I got in it to go to work one morning, and could not get it into gear. This baffled me, as it was perfectly fine the day before. Turns out, I had to have it towed to the dealership and they claimed that a bearing wore out in the clutch kit and an entirely new clutch kit had to be installed. At that time, the car was two - I've NEVER heard of such a thing and was horrified! The service manager was vary vague in answering any questions. Fast forward to this Holiday weekend...my daughter and I were headed out for breakfast in honor of my Birthday, when suddenly, the 'new' clutch blows in the middle of a busy city street, leaving us stranded with people honking and waving their arms madly behind us. This time, the car was stuck in first gear, the clutch would not engage and I was in a panic. We finally managed to push it out of traffic to a safe spot to wait for the tow truck. The kicker this time is that my beloved dealership, where I bought the car and have had it faithfully serviced for three years is closing it's doors on Monday!!! This left me having my car towed 15 miles south to a huge dealership that I've never dealt with before, whose online reviews for service are nothing short of appalling. 

Let me recap by saying that I thought I selected my car very carefully. I have absolutely loved an adored it, even though I've replaced both headlights (they are not cheap!) and tail lights and more hubcaps than I can count by now. I can live with those petty annoyances, but what really concerns me is that I have 16 months left to pay on this car, and the THIRD clutch is being installed this week. For the record, I baby my car, and most certainly do not beat up on my clutch. In fact, I'm hoping how someone can explain how a bearing gets sheared off, resulting in a brand new kit being installed, then the clutch plate gives way in the brand new kit, 10 months later. 

Looks like I'll be trading in my car as soon as it's paid off! I lack the words to express how incredibly disappointed I am. The WHOLE reason I bought a brand new car was so that I did not have to deal with maintenance problems like this. VERY, VERY POORLY DONE, FIAT!
"
fiat,500,2012,pandacar, 04/09/2015,Too many repairs - clutch failure not warrantied,3,"I want to love this car, but one of the main reasons I bought it was for its affordability and I haven't even had it 2 years and I'm already paying 10% of the original cost in repairs! I bought it one year used with 11,000 miles on it. It's now 28,000 at miles and it's had problems with everything from cosmetic issues like peeling paint, to an air bag sensor failure, to a very serious no-warning clutch failure (which was not covered under warranty after 15,000 miles). The clutch replacement at a FIAT dealer has taken 10 days so far and is costing a small fortune. It's a fun car but just not holding up! I always drove a Subaru or Toyota before and I think it may be time to go back. "
fiat,500,2012,Kellster07, 09/03/2015,2012 Fiat 500 pop,4,"I love my fiat its adorable inside and out and gets me where I want to go. Due to the wide trunk we are actually able to fit a lot in the back of my fiat with the back seats down including our lawn mower. I have had to replace my windshield several times due to rocks hitting the windshield while driving in highways due to fiat being so low to ground. I also think the windshield glass is not strong as the rocks were not too big and I was far from the trucks. Another issue I had was my hubcabs continuously fall off, I paid for two and then decided to stop paying for them and have had one missing for 9 months now as I refuse to pay for another. The clock in my car is always wrong, small detail yes but annoying, as I have fixed it to the correct time a dozen times and it weirdly keeps going back to 7 minutes behind schedule. The inside of the car is very hard to clean including the steering wheel and dashboard due to the texture and different finishes. It either doesnt clean it at all or leaves streaks, I have tried a bunch of different cleaning products at this point. The ride is beyond bumpy, my friends who have ridden in the car have stated that it feels like they are on a carnival ride. The back seats are not comfortable at all and not full side seats, so if you want that dont get a fiat. The front seat  surprisingly has a lot of leg room per my husband. The car is easy to drive and park and gets great gas mileage. I have people asking me about my car and peering in the window all the time. Its an adorable car and fun to drive but definitely has it drawbacks.

fiat,500,2012,Sherry Pierce, 11/25/2015,"Turn the ignition, nothing happens!",3,"My 2012 Fiat L was purchased new from dealer in late 2012.  Very glad it came with a 50,000 4 yr warranty as it spends a lot of time at the dealer getting ""fixed.""  After 3 attempts to correct issue with tire pressure light staying on, gave up on it and just disregard the light.  My car shut off while I was on the highway doing 55 so I felt blessed to have been able to get it to the shoulder.  I was an hour from home in Feb on a freezing day with an infant in the car, but when I my husband arrived the car started and he drove it home like nothing had happened.  Sixteen months later, the car died dead again while driving near the beach, this time I had AAA and had it towed to the dealer.  Gone nearly 2 weeks and they just replaced the alternator & battery.  After that the car would no longer start on first turn of ignition but roared to life on second try... but six weeks later would not start at all.  Almost 2 weeks at dealer as they replaced the starter.  Two months later, it still won't start on first turn of ignition and it has randomly refused to start at all 3 times in the past month.  If I move the shift, open/close door, step on brake and go thru antics it starts, usually after I have called AAA to come get me and have to call them back to cancel the tow.  I have had it.  Hope to have enough equity to trade by this coming Fall as the negatives are outdoing the positives at this point.  I do love the look, the size and the gas mileage but once my warranty is over, this is NOT a car I want to keep due to scary maintenance costs.

fiat,500,2012,CG13, 08/05/2015,Can't Wait To Get Rid Of It!,2,"I've had this car for three years and have put 20,000 miles on it. Bought it because it was adorable, inexpensive, and great for my city-street/low-speed commute (which is now a freeway commute). Here is my take on the car:

The GOOD: Cute as heck. Verde Chiaro color still turns heads. Good little car for putting around town (grocery-getter) on city streets. Brakes are responsive. Storage space in the car is about what you expect - not a lot of room but with a little bit of tetris skills you can fit a lot. Decent gas mileage (I expected better for a car so small).

The BAD: I fear for my life on the freeway - no joke - and I am a very good driver who has never had an accident. Blind spots galore! Acceleration is extremely unreliable - sometimes you give it gas and it reluctantly goes slowly, other times the engine revs but it sits there... So if you need to make an evasive maneuver that requires accelerating, hit the gas and hope for the best. Engine noise gives me a headache. Interior shows scratches easily. My tire pressure monitor sensor stopped working at 15k (I haven't the time during the week to have it taken care of since the dealer won't do anything other than oil changes on Saturdays). My boyfriend said it's like a beer can on wheels and worries about my safety every day. Must use 91 octane or better gas for best performance. Doesn't always start on the first turn (Fiat said this is normal for this engine - ???).

I foolishly accepted a lease term longer than I wanted and am almost done but am seriously considering eating the penalties for turning it in early. Especially since it looks like it is prone to having more mechanical issues that I would be responsible for.

Since day 1, the dashboard isn't happy unless there is an indicator light on! It's always something wrong with the car, things that should hardly ever go wrong. The headlamps are always needing repair. It's a three year old car and already I've had the engine worked on 3 times, all lights replaced, a new airconditioner put in, the starter went out and that was over $500.00 in repairs, and most recently the gear switch cord broke...another $500.00 repair. I'm afraid to drive it and unfortunately I still have 2-3 years of payments to make on this car. I'm so very sad I trusted the good reviews and the commercials saying how great the car is. As far as fuel consumption..I pay just as much as if I had a larger car. I bought the car to help save money, help support dealers in in America and to have an economical car while I'm going through a low paying job transition and it has made me late with all my bills because of always needing repairs. I need a miracle to get me out of this car. so disappointed. I'm in tears writing this review.

fiat,500,2012,C@, 01/14/2016,"Originally Excited, Now Regretting Purchase",3,"2012 Fiat:  43,208 miles - Automatic Trans.
Purchased July/August 2014 from a seedy local dealership whom can't be held accountable for this ""Lemon"".  

It drives GREAT, when it's working but I live in the U.P. of Michigan.  Hard winters are common and the car doesn't have much clearance (which I knew purchasing the car and wasn't worried).  However, the digital displays do not work after 20 degrees (and in the winter that is normally -20 degrees).  25 minutes is usually how long i had to run the car to warm up the car enough for the digital displays to work properly (which wouldn't be bad except the accurate speedometer is digital).   

When I first logged on to their online service/maintenance report- I had seen that it was in for electrical work (I believe) twice, and did not think anything of it at the time.  However, around Thanksgiving of that same year I had to send my car to the car dealership in Traverse City for work to be done.  I did not get my car back until late December 2015 because the parts were out of stock.  The customer service department was very nice about the delay, and towing to the customer service department was paid by the Fiat brand because it was under warranty (I paid for bridge tolls $50.00).  I had to make arrangements to get a ride to Traverse City to pick up my car because they were going to charge me to bring it back. 

The dealership in this area that sold me the car, Fernelius Hyundai, would not help me in the slightest besides giving me a lender car for three days around Thanksgiving- they said it was my problem and I should be thankful for their generosity. 

When I received my car it worked fine, but then in February of 2015 the same thing happened again.  I received free towing to Traverse City, and I had to pay bridge tolls again.  This time customer service in Traverse City said they couldn't find the problem, but it seemed to be working fine (my theory was that since it is warmer in Traverse City they didn't have the same issue). 

Now it is January 2016, we had a warmer than normal winter.  AGAIN, I have the same problem with my Fiat.  I again will have to send it down to Traverse City to get it worked on, however, I don't believe it will fall under the 4 year warranty/50,000 miles.  This means I will probably have to pay for the towing and bridge tolls out of pocket.

I cannot in good mind sell my car.

I believe Fernelius Hyundai knew of these problems. 
I no longer have access to the previous service records on my car that I can tell.  I believe I have no protection in this but want to try. 
I can't believe there isn't a recall on my 2012 Fiat after having the same problem YEARLY.

I was willing to tolerate that since it's still under warranty, until the clutch ""wore out"". I've been driving a stick for 30+ years and have never worn out a clutch, so, in spite of what Fiat customer ""care"" said, it was not caused by my lousy driving. Although the rest of the car is still under warranty, the clutch is a wear item and is not covered. My car suddenly was undriveable (a potential safety issue), it was stranded 200 miles from my home, it cost $1200 out of my pocket to repair and over $300 in rental car fees to get home and then get back to pick up the car. This at less then 40K miles. "
fiat,500,2012,KenN, 01/24/2016,Coming up on 4 yrs of ownership,3,"Love the car, but hate the quality - and depreciation.  Purchased new for HS graduate in May 2012.  Rear bumper reflector just dropped off randomly - covered under warranty.  Shift knob top broke off - covered under warranty.  Steering clunk - tightened but not replaced with correct new intermediate shaft under warranty - clunk is back, but now 2 thousand miles out of warranty.  Arm rest broke - cushion fell off - fixed my self with gorilla glue.  Sun roof does not work - and pealed paint on strip in front of sun roof ( for over 20 months ) - but out of warranty - as I had no access to car since daughter had it at college.  I am deathly afraid the clutch will die per other reviews - we have 54000 miles on the car.  I do my own oil and filter changes as dealership service shop is only open during week and my daughter only comes home on weekends.  

Having said all that - the car is fun to drive with great brakes and decent enough acceleration for a guy who grew up in a time when zero to 60 in 10 seconds was considered fast.  I asked dealership to make me an offer for trade in to purchase a used car off the lot ( Korean or Japanese ) - and even they don't want the car.  NO offer.  Paid 21K for it and now worth less than 7 K I expect for trade in.  The Bose stereo is awesome.   Gas mileage driving highway is above 38 mpg at 75 mph, so decent - but bigger cars get that now days.  Would I buy again - no - way - ... will I keep it - probably will take it over and keep as 3rd car.

I'm 6 foot 2 and just barely stay under the (broken) sunroof - so I can live with it - driving position is strange, but I am used to it.  I like the car - I hate the quality and/or lack of responsibility by Fiat / Chrysler for standing behind the product for the following issues - Steering rack clunk / Paint peeling / arm rest - can't comment on the Sun Roof other than I read it was glued in from the interior and there is no way I'm paying for that repair.

fiat,500,2012,Seth Simon, 03/14/2016,There are no boring trips in an Abarth!,5,"This is a niche car and not for everyone, and that's why it's special. A Camry or an Accord are for everyone, and when you make something to please as many people as possible you end up with middle of the road blandness. That's great for some, not for Abarth owners. 

This is a performance car based on a relatively humble small European city car, originally designed for dense urban areas. So, yeah, if you have 5 kids and two dogs, guess what? It's not a car for you. If you appreciate efficiency of space, fuel and technology, are concerned about your footprint on the planet but really like to drive, then an Abarth may be for you. It oozes character, it sounds fantastic and I love that it doesn't look like it's angry and wants to kill you, like so many other cars on the market. 

It's actually pretty comfortable for long trips, and despite its compact exterior dimensions, it has a lot of space, more than a Mini. I'm 5'-10"" and 190lbs and I can sit comfortably in the rear seat behind myself. It's easy to park and cheap to fill the tank, and no one gets annoyed at you when you pass them. Try doing that in a BMW or Mercedes.

I considered a Ford Fiesta ST, but was turned off by the four door-only body style, and although objectively it was a tad more refined than the Abarth in some areas, it just didn't feel special, and certainly wasn't as much fun to drive. 

The quality of materials is not on par with say, a Lexus, but then it doesn't cost Lexus money. I've had mine for two years and the only issues I've had were a burned out light bulb in the cruise control switch and a faulty tire pressure monitoring sensor. Nothing squeaks or rattles. Overall, I've been very very happy with this car.

*Update 5 years into ownership:

Still have it; was thinking about getting something else but it's paid for and it's been very dependable, so keeping it and tuning it. Love this car!

Update: 6 years into ownership:

A couple of minor squeaks developed. One is in the rear suspension, and my mechanic took care of it by loosening the bolts securing the rear anti-roll bar, spraying them w silicone and re tightening them to the correct specs. 

The door panels also squeak, not loudly, but noticeable enough to be slightly annoying. I've solved it by spraying silicone grease behind the door panels. It lasts for a three months or so. 

I've had to replace the original Pirelli P Zeros, which we just OK, so I went w bigger diameter wheels and wider tires, which made a huge difference in grip and stability in high speed corners. I recommend 205 /17s.

I've had to replace tires, brake pads, spark-plugs and the usual filters, but nothing else. Looking at a bigger sport sedan, but keeping the Abarth regardless. Still gives me joy every time the rorty exhaust comes to life.

fiat,500,2012,cacplanor, 11/18/2014,Not good,1,"2013 Sport purchased new now with 34K. Same problems many others are facing. Starting stumble, clunks heard and felt through steering system, suspension bumpers, eating tires once a year! Its nice to look at and fun to drive but that's about it. Run away if you appreciate what a ""good"" car is. Chrystler doesn't care if your car is broken, they'll tell you it's all ""normal"". You know, that ""normal"" clunk in the steering. The same clunk which would have stopped you/me from buying the car if a new one made it! Mine had that ""norma""l clunk after only 6K miles. Thanks for that screw Chrysler, I won't soon forget it! Your cars suck and Uncle Sam should've let fail like you deserved. 

Got worse! Clutch pressure plate springs failed at 59k. Fiat considers this a wearable item only covered by a 1 year, 12k mile warranty. All other clutch parts are un-worn. Disc looks new! Fiat demies any known issues with these pressure plates, yet many 5 speed owners are in this boat, weird!?! Garbage car from a garbage brand. Traded in at a HUGE loss after only 3 years. $14,000 in depreciation.

I would NEVER buy another Fiat. If they were the last car company on earth,, I'd ride a bike.

fiat,500,2012,rtwolfe, 10/09/2011,500 Pop Manual - Fast Car and Love it,5,"My first car was an MGB and I loved it. I feel the exact same way about this car.
I smile to and from work every day.
Also, it WILL go fast but you have to drive it like an Italian.
Here's what it takes. 
1. Manual Transmission - Auto is not quick
2. Sport button on
3. Shift at high RPMs - 4000 to 6500
4. High Octane Premium Gas - BP 93 works
5. Mobile 1 oil-makes Multivalve engine run better
6. High Flow Drop In air filter - check 500madness

Other than the transmission, this set of small changes made a huge difference in how the car responds.
It flys.
Also, with Sport on, the steering is crisp and the throttle is quick.
Take a test drive. You will love it too."

I had A Mini Clubman that was being fixed after an accident.
When I got the news that the Mini was being totaled there was no hesitation. I was hooked.
I had my seats upgraded to red leather (with black tops)
and had a black stripe put on the on side doors.
It looks adorable and hot!!
Still waiting for the black and white checkered graffic for the roof.
This isn't Fiat's fault 3M is having production troubles.

I bought the 5 speed manual.
I average 40 mpg(combined) and I use regular gas.
Don't waste your money on premium.

No issues.
Car feels like a much more expensive car, all around.
The car has plenty of pickup and flys on the highway.
The convertible is very quiet.

The fiat is quieter than a 2005 Honda s2000 that I bought new.
Looking at the car you would never think it will fit 4 people, but it does.
Brakes are great as is the handling.
If you buy it, you won't be disappointed.

While it looked cool and was extremely fun to drive, I quickly learned to loathe the car. Two steering arms and one master control module later (car had less than 20,000 miles on it), I looked for any way to unload this car without taking a huge loss. In addition to these issues, the backseat began to come apart at 12,000 miles (and rarely did I have anyone sit in the back). The engine block heater worked wonderfully but it began to malfunction and send error codes to the main computer. I was calling the dealer (90 miles away) for service every few weeks. Finally, at 24,500 miles, I called it quits."
fiat,500,2012,Sue G, 02/02/2016,Don't buy a Fiat,2,"Don't buy a Fiat because they don't stand behind their products!!!!! I purchased a used 2012 Fiat Pop May of 2014. In June of 2014 it needed a new purge valve solenoid and had a rotted transmission ground strap. The vehicle at that time had 54,274 miles on it. It had to go to the dealership in Johnston RI to be repaired. In December 2015 I had to replace a broken motor mount. My mechanic also stated that the control arm needs to be replaced. He called the dealership in Johnston RI and was told the parts on the 2012 control arm had been replaced with what the 2013 Fiat has because of poor engineering and that we would have to buy 2 lower ball joints, axles and knuckle bearings. The cost 1,800 not including labor. He asked if it was a recall and was told it was not. They advised him that if the vehicle was still under warranty and under 60,000 miles they would cover it. My anger comes from that vehicle would have been covered had the dealership done the right thing when the car was there in 2014. They knew at that time those parts were faulty. January I broke down and needed to be towed because of the Alternator and battery. February I need a thermostat, sensor and housing. What next???? I called Fiat to complain and all they could say over and over again “The cost of parts denied and the vehicle is out of warranty””!!!! I'm not asking about reimbursement on all the other repairs. They just need to do the right thing and stand behind the faulty parts when they knew it was an issue. Not to mention you can only get the parts from the dealership and they are rude and difficult to deal with. The cost I just shelled out for the alternator 389.70 and battery 155.69. Total for that repair with labor 741.98. I purchased the vehicle for 9,000 after my trade in. I am so angry I just want to get rid of this vehicle but can’t. I still owe 6,000 on it and when I looked up the Kelly blue book the car is worth 3,000. All I want is for them to repair this control arm issue with no cost to me and they won’t!!!!! Learn from me and before you buy do lots of research. The parts are very expensive and the dealership and customer service are sneaky and very rude to deal with.

1100 miles on it.
No issues other than the fact that the door panels are made of cheap plastic and will scratch easily.

Combined mpg so far is 34.
Not great but better the the Miata we sold.
Our 500 with manual trans. can get 40 on the Highway.
Hilly here in Western Washington State which may be dropping the combined mpg down.

Feel we got a fair deal from Fiat of Tacoma...Would work with them again.

The added cold air intake and reverse exhaust add to the fun factor.

Highly recommend this car.

When I traded it the following repairs were required. Air conditioning not working, front end repairs for $1600.
Leaking heater core, high beams that won't go to low. Brake power unit for $900.
Paid 18000 and got 8000 on trade after 16 months and 85000 klm.
MY dealer experience was awful.

Driver arm rest came apart under warranty but the first repair disabled the seats ability to move forward by pulling on seat back release handle and it took them several months and 4 returns for repair until they figured it out. The original battery suddenly went dead with no warning just past warranty leaving us stranded and in need of a road side service call and new battery. Most costly was main computer malfunction at 62,000 miles out of warranty at a cost of over $700.00 and still making payments on original car loan and this major problem, the problems was the headlights would not turn off, not even with switched to off nor by shutting off car, had to unplug headlights. The new computer is warrantied for just one year. At the same time as the computer going out the service department stated the steering was in need of repair at a cost of nearly $300, at this time I have yet to repair the steering and am driving it as is since the service person said it wouldn't keep me from safe driving.

Poor customer service including refusal to give reasoning in writing, an e-mail address and also to give me the persons last name that denied minor repair.

Requested an appeal and denied...told she was the final say and was speaking for FIAT.

I just traded in my 08 Mini for the Fiat 500 Sport.
I live in Houston, and do a lot of running around the city.
It's peppy, quick, and easy to drive and park.
If you enjoy a smaller ride, you should seriously consider purchasing a Fiat.
I test drove the manual and automatic through city streets and on the freeways.
I felt that the manual had much more power and pep.
You have to know when to downshift to maximize your driving potential.
For the price, you definitely wont find anything remotely close.
I miss the speed of my Mini, but not the overpriced maintenance and heavy ride."
fiat,500,2012,Maureen M, 08/11/2015,Should have known better than to buy a Fiat,3,"I bought my 2012 Fiat 500 Pop used. This was 2 years ago and it had 36,000 miles on it. (Found out it had been a former rental car...in Las Vegas). The only reason I chose this one was it was the only used automatic they had (I can drive a manual but in L.A. I choose not to).  Electrical problems from the start. Warning lights always coming on (Check engine). Half the time they couldn't say what was wrong. For a couple months the car went to service every other week. Finally got that to stop then one day I turn on the car and the mileage was blinking. Again to the shop for resetting. I took my car in for an oil change a couple weeks ago and was told it had a leak (somewhere where they needed to drop out the engine). $89 for parts. Over $1k for labor. (Not had it done). This past Friday I pushed the button to lower my drivers window and heard a thunk. Window dropped an inch and has stayed there. Getting it fixed today. Thankfully (without being consulted when I bought the car) I somehow ended up with the extended warranty - Maximum Care. So the window will be just $100 (deductible). Going to find out if the oil leak is covered as well. 

I wanted to trade in the car for a new 500L since they contacted me looking for 2012 Pops. Too much negative equity. Well no kidding. This thing had negative equity when I bought it. Kicking myself for not buying the brand new Toyota Prius C that I test drove at another dealership. As soon as I can this car is gone!

fiat,500,2012,Henry Zbyszynski, 12/08/2015,The City car,5,"This car was designed to be in a city. The city mpg was always over 22 and the highway went as high as 40. Highway driving was fine with the acceleration of the manual gearbox allowing me to merge into traffic going 60+ mph. I was comfortable driving at 72 mph.Most of my driving was in the Boston area and traversing the river on a high bridge gave me no difficulty in a cross wind.  The back seat was occasional used (sometime by me) by adults with no difficulty as long as the passenger seat was move forward a little. With the back seat  folded down and access through the hatchback made this a useful vehicle. I always got a lot of attention in a parking lot.

fiat,500,2012,Brad Johnson, 05/31/2016,Sporty little car with a big personality!,5,"I was in the market to buy a car for my son, a high school senior who will be college-bound next year and in need of good, reliable, safe wheels under him. The Fiat 500c seemed the perfect fit, literally - my son is  6' 5"" and he slipped right in to the driver's seat with ease. There was plenty of head and leg room, once the tilt wheel and seat were adjusted. This car handles extremely well and is very tight on turns. What surprised me was the amount of interior space - the outside appearance is deceiving, as once you get inside, it is a well distributed area for 4 people.  Equally so is the trunk space, which provides a deep, larger-than-expected compartment for all kinds of storage.  Even better is the feature of the split rear seat, which folds down and allows for larger items to fit from the folded down seat to the trunk space.  Very smooth ride - takes those bumps in the road really well which reflects a good suspension system. Plus, it's a convertible !!  What's better than that?  Although I have firmly told my son that he is not to put the top down and stand up while driving, with his feet on the wheel....!   Also comes with some nice options like a 7-speaker Bose sound system, fog lights, hands-free Blue-tooth phone system, heated seats and special chrome trim that comes with the ""Lounge"" (high end) model.  It is a great little car that is super on gas and a blast to drive - my son loves it.  Life is too short, and for a car in this price range, loosen up and go grab some fun.  You won't be sorry!

fiat,500,2012,scottishere, 11/07/2011,Loving the Fiat!,4,"I actually got a Pop with the automatic transmission. This car is fun to drive and definitely gets noticed on the freeways. It definitely does not feel like a cheap car. It's well-built and solid on the road. I traded in a mid-sized sedan for my Fiat, so I expected a big adjustment. The car doesn't feel tiny inside. I have lots of head room (I didn't get the sunroof) and I've been able to find a comfortable driving position. You sit high in this car. It's not a road-burner, but it scoots along pretty well. The SPORT option firms up the steering and adjusts the way the 6-speed transmission shifts gears."

It was there for 2 months, I asked them finally for replacement (lemon law, which my car, which was sadly the case) so they dragged their feet for another month, plus charged me for mileage on the poor car they sold me. It was extortion, but after 3 months I paid it just to get a car....I don't think the service dept was at fault, they simply couldn't figure out what's wrong, but the dealer didn't help us at all, and Chrysler was even worse."
fiat,500,2012,shabba2, 10/03/2012,The Manny Pacquiao of the car world,4,"Easily the best decision I've ever made on an impulse. While looking at the Sport model, this Abarth was left behind by the original buyer. I snapped it up as I overheard him declining to buy it after ordering it. Let's see, this car goes like stink, gets phenomenal gas mileage (I'm averaging 38 on the highway at 75 mph), looks like nothing else, is built well, is very uncommon, is surprisingly comfortable on any sort of trip, has standard options that most cars would not in this price range, has an exhaust that makes a Ferrari jealous, and it's priced perfectly. Abarth is like the Carroll Shelby of the 500 world. They took something that was nearly perfect and made it perfect. "
fiat,500,2012,toaot500, 06/24/2011,Texas 500,4,"I ve had my car for about a month and I am enamored with it! It drives like a much sportier and expensive car you feel the bumps but only slightly most of it is absorbed. I cant tell you how much I love the way the interior looks like it came from a Maserati. I ve had alot of cars in the past but this one is actually my favorite so far. It may not be the fastest on the road but you never get the impression that its not. I was going for the Sport model because I liked the wheels and the body kit but the differences, between it and the Pop are minimal in performance (I've test driven both in a manual). Both have a sport button like the Mini that make the small 1.4l come alive. GAS SAVER!"
fiat,500,2012,Michelle Walsh, 12/03/2015,"I Hate to Say It, But...",3,"As much as I love it, it's got to go.

Bought used with about 40K miles on it. It's fun to drive, gets great mileage, and I had no complaints until I went to have the oil changed and the mechanic told me there were metal particles in the oil, and I shouldn't be driving it. I bought it from CarMax, who have been wonderful about dealing with this: ended up having to replace the engine (no cost to me), but when the car came back after being gone for a month, the antennae had been broken off (and not replaced) and one of my hubcaps was missing (again, CarMax is being great about repair/replacement).

Came out a week ago to drive to church, and the driver's side door handle came off in my hand. Not a big thing, but a) I live in Wisconsin, where it gets pretty cold, and it was very temperate the night before-not like it was well below freezing and therefore brittle, and b) This car doesn't even have 50,000 miles on it yet.

I'm now wondering ""what next"" every time I get in the car to drive it. It makes me sad, because I've really loved this car. Too bad Fiat can't make something more reliable...

fiat,500,2012,Madri, 08/07/2016,Looks aren't everything...,1,"I purchased the car in 2012, brand-new,and wish I hadn't.  First off, the car  randomly powered off (the engine stopped, all the lights turned off, it just turned off!)  well making a slight left turn on a very hot day. I went to the mechanic they said it was a fluke. Next,  the car  light turned on but the car wouldn't, the engine light all of the dashboard lights turned on, but the car wouldn't start. We managed to get the car running, drove 30 miles to the dealer where we purchased this Fiat (in Ontario California),  and ritual by the mechanics to leave it overnight so they can check it out. Four days later  The dealer calls us and tells us on the car needed was a new battery (the car was still under warranty, and the battery was covered). Shortly thereafter (our warranty expired), The dashboard lights will turn on and the car had trouble starting. It was mellow at first, taking a couple of key turns to get the car running...until one day the car just stopped running. We got it to the mechanic,  this time we went to the dealership in Riverside, and they told us there was a leak, and it was dripping on the starter. They let us know it would be OK but that we needed to take care of the leak and possibly get a new starter. We drove the car home, less than 10 miles, and it completely stopped running.  Now we have to take it to get towed to the dealer, pay close to $1200 to get it fixed (and that's if they don't find any other crazy thing going on with the stupid car). Every time I see a Fiat in the freeway or on the street, I get a stomachache. This is the most unreliable car ever.

The 500 Pop is surprisingly powerful off the line, shifts smoothly, rides quietly even at 85-90 MPH, and gets great MPG. It is more roomy and comfortable up front than expected.

I got 5 replacements (at different times) from the dealership when I was under warrantee, but since that has ended I have been driving two hubcaps short for over 15,000 miles.  I hope to find some replacements soon, but since 2 of my 5 replaced FIAT hubcaps have fallen off a second time I plan to buy another brand to make it worth the money.  Other than the hubcaps I am very happy with my FIAT and it has been keeping up with my long weekends very well.

fiat,500,2012,Star, 03/01/2016,Never Buy a Fiat! Worst Investment,1,"Good afternoon all,

To anyone reading this I hope this review helps you in not repeating the same mistake I have made with this affiliation. Although Fiats are cute in shape there are so many future faults. I currently own a 2012 Fiat 500c Lounge. When I purchased my car Certified Pre-owned at 23k miles I was provided with a car report which only stated car went in for routine maintenance. Fast forward to about 10k miles later I have to get a new battery, tune up etc. I thought nothing of it. I am currently at 58k miles and 8k out of warranty and my transmission light comes on randomly one day stating ""check transmission - see handbook"". I contacted the Fiat customer service (1-888.242.6342 spoke with Robin, Brenda, Mercedes & Josh -Total Calls 8) to see if they could assist with any repairs. They advised me my car history states my fiat has been sent in twice for a new radiator and once for sunroof repair (No wonder previous owner traded it in. A new radiator was installed first 2k miles no accidents just manufacture faults. I had NO prior knowledge of this issue it was never reported nor communicated to me when purchasing). Brenda, then stated they would need it to be diagnoses first to see what they can do. However, in order to do so I would need to take it into the fiat studio etc. Fiat Studio address: 196 South Dupont Highway Newcastle, DE phone no: 3023231666 service advisor: Tony - not helpful had no clue what was going on just guessing games. I was charged a total of $460 just for them to tell me an incomplete, inconsistent diagnosis (Diagnosis code P0741 had been provided to them at drop off before any work was performed - Tony said that was not helpful could mean anything. (Diagnosis means: Torque Converter Clutch Circuit Performance or Stuck Off). Since Fiat customer service said they needed additional details I told ""Tony the unhelpful"" he would need to provide additional details which is why my initial price sky rocketed from $99.95 (because I had a coupon original price $115.97) to $460. The only diagnosis I was provided was that it was a mechanical issue and repairs would be $5,975 (no lie I will never forget this number). 

In order to get a better understanding because I am a female and cars aren't my forte'. I asked ""Tony the Unhelpful"" what can cause these kinds of issues? He stated its a computer issue and would need rewiring. I provide this feedback to Fiat customer service  who now state since I am out of warranty theres nothing they can do. I understand that, however they should've advised me that before I went ahead and authorized Tony to do absolutely nothing but fiddle around with gadgets? The customer service gave me the impression I would be covered. I have begged, pleaded, cried, went to FCA customer service only to be directed back to Fiat customer service. I even asked that they at least cover half of the diagnosis due to useless customer service as well as mechanical faults. They continuously stated ""no"". In the mist of all of this I still remained optimistic. I continuously attempted to find the root to this problem. I thought maybe this could've have been due to water. I then contacted my insurance company who then performed an extensive investigation and stated after careful review there was no evidence of water damages - claim denied. I contacted the Fiat to advise them of this and also advise that I was told ""this is a mechanical issue"". Fiat Customer Service then states ""Carmen Chrysler Jeep Dodge"" told them my car was ""maintained poorly and it was water damaged"". (My car has a low tire thread on left side everything else is in great shape I promise). I advise the rep of this and also advise her there were no signs of water damages after my insurance performed their investigation. She then contacts shop to verify they then agree that yes in fact the only thing is the tire and confirm no
 water damage. Fiat still advises me there still nothing they can do since I am out of warranty. They advised that it was my fault since the tire is low it impacted my transmission. I am perfectly fine with that response. I will take full responsibility if that was indeed the case however, that was NOT the case!! After further research and second opinion from AAMCO turns out it was a system issue / computer issue - Mechanical failure the tires had absolutely NOTHING to do with this mechanical failure in fact AAMCO was $300+ cheaper (they waive diagnostic fee if you repair issue). This was all caused by a fault in the transmission so to wrap this review up my Fiat was a complete LEMON when it was first installed. I was lied to upon purchase information was never placed on carfax if it had been I would have NEVER joined the Fiat family because this is a common issue that I had no idea about until now. 

In conclusion, I would advise anyone seeking a fiat or even going for servicing at this location especially females to look elsewhere. For interested fiat lookers look elsewhere bad c

fiat,500,2012,740driver, 12/09/2011,Cheerful fun,4,"For years I considered buying a Mini Cooper but every time I drove one the rough ride and heavy steering made me walk away.
The Fiat is much more civilized, especially on bumpy city streets in places like Washington, DC.
 The steering is light, making the car feel lighter and more agile than the Mini.
With the ivory colored steering wheel, seat trim and headliner the Fiat is a delightful place to be.
 For me, the cheerfulness of the Fiat sold me over the aggressiveness of the Mini."

The soundtrack from the exhaust is phenomenal, has to be the best stock soundtrack out there. Fuel mileage is consistently 33-34mpg. I use premium seeing as it's turbo charged. My Prima averaged 36-38 mpg. Love driving this car. It's a blast. Looking forward to the Abarth convertible!"
fiat,500,2012,robhmass, 09/13/2013,One of the best I've ever owned,4,"Bought mine with optional alloy wheels, sunroof, and a couple of other options in April 2012. Got a great price. Had the car now for 17 months & have driven 38,000 miles with no mechanical problems.
There was a service bulletin recall concerning ungrounded starter bolts which the dealership fixed promptly along with a blown bi-halogen headlight(probably related to the ungrounded starter bolts). However, service tech did not unhook the battery while replacing starter bolts and shorted out the climate control panel. So, now, the car is back @ the dealer to replace this. Dealer did give a loaner.
Absolutely no other issues. Car is great on gas(38-40mpg mostly highway) and fun, fun to drive. "
fiat,500,2012,Dave Condon, 09/06/2015,Urban Vehicle,2,"I live in the Seattle area which means tight parking spaces and little maneuvering room. 
The Fiat 500 is an urban vehicle by definition. It is half the size and weight of a Ford F 150. 
The Fiat 500 works good for its design purpose. The five speed transmission (manual) is as smooth shifting as they come.
I have had a speaker blow out in one of the doors. The Blue and Me full functions are a joke as the program only works for Microsoft phones.  Visibility is excellent.  The doors are very wide making getting in and out easy. And finally, the car always has a smile on the grill.
I notice time and again people smiling back at the car and children turning around for a second look. The Fiat 500 is fun to drive.
UPDATE: While getting my oil changed at the Fiat dealer a red with bright green wheels Fiat Pop 500 came into the service center. The owner needed a new wiper blade. His car had 123,000 miles on it with no major problems.
--> At 19000 miles transmission pressure plate and transmission synchro started to fail and I got a factory recall notice for a problem related to clutch failures. My Fiat 500 Pop was a cute car but I traded it. I replaced it with a 2016 KIA Rio and a 100000 mile, 10 year warranty.  My Fiat days are over.<--
Safety: The little Fiat places the vehicle occupants in serious danger in a rear end collision as there is nothing to crumple. The little Fiat is cute but with all the distracted cell phone drivers
on the road, a rear end hit is a high probability.

fiat,500,2012,Kieza C., 02/15/2018,Cute is never enough,2,"I bought this car because my aunt had one and because it was so cute. This car has broken more times than my previous car which had almost 200,000 miles on it, I owned that one for 8 years and I've had the Fiat for 5. I did all of the scheduled maintenance, even after my warranty ran out. I have had to replace...the oil pressure sensor, the throttle position sensor, the thermostat, the alternator, the windshield wash reservoir, and I'm on my second replacement O2 sensor.  Inside the cable that moves the front passenger seat up and forward at the same time didn't last the first year, and I don't have kids so it was used that often. The fuses for the climate controller lighting have been replaced several times. The daytime running lights are nearly impossible to get to to replace the bulbs. The holders for the felt covered section that covers the cargo area broke within the first few months.  The car handles really well in the snow though, when it can get out of it's own way. It's annoying that you can't open the back hatch unless you unlock it with the keyfob, There's no button inside the car and no keyhole outside. If you get out of your car and run around to the back to get something you have to shut the car off to unlock the back hatch. Although it is nice that it's set up so you virtually cannot lock your keys in the car. The keyfob mangles really easily, like just from regular use. Right now we are trying to figure out why nothing happens when I put the pedal to the floor uphill on the highway. Oh and if your thermostat goes the car will try to kill you by registering an overheat that isn't happening which throttles the engine back without warning. Then after it has it's fit everything goes back to normal. Lastly the repair costs will put you in the poor house and dealer parts are almost always on back order.

fiat,500,2012,E. Howard, 11/21/2019,"R.I.P., Francesco!",5,"After driving one in Tuscany, when they arrived stateside, I had to buy! I found my perfect match, a pearl white with beautiful tan and ivory leather, a Lounge. It had 21000 miles on it.

 I drove Francesco with pride and enthusiasm, even after we moved, and the nearest dealer was 50 miles away. We were unique, and people were intrigued to see. 

I made several multi state road trips, and always felt safe and comfortable. There were never any service problems. The battery and tires were replaced, but never needed new brake pads. Headlamps, because I always drove with them on to be more visible were replaced a few times. 

Then, the unthinkable happened. We had a head on collision on a two lane county road. Combined total speed I believe was around 70mph. Francesco ricocheted backwards around 70 feet, and stopped in a culvert. 

All the airbags deployed. I suffered bruises to my wrists, and my right leg. My sternum is bruised, and three weeks later, breathing can still be painful. But, the engine compartment kept its integrity, and there was no intrusion into the passenger cabin at all! 

I will grieve for Francesco Fiat. I had him for six great years. He had 93,000 miles on him, at the end, I had intended to probably double that! Every time I drove that car, I would smile, and say, once, I was in Italy....

fiat,500,2012,Chelsea, 01/13/2017,Love it so far!,4,"I fell in love with Fiats after my trip to Italy and have wanted one ever since. After being super unhappy with Honda, I traded in for a Fiat. As a college student who works a lot and commutes, I put a lot of miles on my cars, relatively quickly. I've had my Fiat for nearly a year and have put on about 10,000 miles on it (now has about 50k miles) and absolutely no problems so far. I don't think it's THAT comfortable of a ride, but it's not uncomfortable. I feel safe in it. It's very responsive. Stereo sounds good. I was really looking for something cost effective and it fits the bill. It costs $15-20 to fill my gas tank which I love. The only issues I have with it are minor. The bluetooth button is annoying, I don't use it and my hand always seems to hit it while steering. And the blinker is a little wonky. I'll have my blinker going left or right, take my turn, and many times it wont turn off so I'll manually put it in the middle to stop blinking, but instead, the opposite blinker goes off. I don't know if it's just my car or a known problem, but it's a pretty minor complaint. I just feel like anyone driving behind me probably thinks I'm crazy when I have my left blinker on, then right after my right blinker may turn on until I can get it to stop blinking. Otherwise, great little car with a lot more space than it looks like from the outside. I love throwing the backseats down and having tons of room. A lot of people stare at it wherever I am because there aren't a whole ton of Fiats around, which is cool. Great commuter car, I truly enjoy it and would recommend it.

fiat,500,2012,Valbowski, 01/12/2018,Extra warranty takes me to 1M miles!,4,"This car has been driven nearly 7 days a week almost every week, for 5.5 years.  Once a year, an oil change is called for, the car will show the warning for that when it is time.  We put a little over 8K miles on it per year, and as this writing, we are at 44K.  This is a base model, no special wheels, just a basic pop.  Aside from once a year oil changes, and scheduled maintenance, the following things have required repair - 1) the wiring harness that connects all things powered to the hatchback had to be replaced.  2) the fan switch for the heating/cooling needed to be replaced 3) and the rear oil seal on the engine began a tiny drip, which was deemed necessary to be replaced.  All of this would have fallen outside of the warranty, but I purchased the 1M mile bumper to bumper warranty.  Per visit, with the extra warranty, there is a $100 plus tax fee.  The above repairs, if I had not had the warranty, would have almost equaled the cost of the warranty!!!  So, since we drive the wheels off of cars, we will be in great shape going forward.  Really, get an additional warranty with your purchase if it is possible.  On another topic, some observations.  I am a big guy, I fill up the front seat, but this is not uncomfortable and I have driven it as far as 10 hours in one day with no suffering or ill effects.  The handling of the vehicle in snow, ice or rain is phenomenal for a small car.  Phenomenal.  I use the auto shift and move from one gear to the other myself right at 2400 rpm.  This gets you the best gas mileage.  Summer, air on, 32+/42+, fall and spring is 33+/45, dead of winter, as in under 15 degrees day after day, 31.6/42.  My drive is boring so I keep myself occupied with mpg games and metal music.  If you look at the maintenance schedule you will notice that very little needs be done, and the maintenance is very far apart too.  Love that.  To fill it up is around $20-22+.  So low.  Forget fuel cells.  Forget battery powered vehicles too.  Sit down and calculate it all, as I did, and the cost per month is almost the lowest of any car on the market.  Change the air filter once a year, don’t bother with high octane fuel, as I tested that and the economy and performance were unchanged, and buy the car.  Surprisingly, when the seats are folded forward in the rear, the car can hold a week’s worth of groceries back there!  It is really large back there I am serious.  However, if you have to people in the backseats, think again!  Short trips, sure.  But that is it.  It looks great, is fun to drive, and has tons of airbags, of course ABS and the electronic wheel control system, so there.  Not perfect, certainly not for everyone, but the fuel economy, the safety, stopping power, and the HUGE warranty make this a pick that works for me and my wife.
*Update 1.12.19
We drive this car 7 days a week nearly.  The other day, the driver's side door handle fell off.  Not covered under warranty.  That is a new one.  Not long after I saw a Fiat on the road with the passenger's side door handle hanging half off.  Weird.
Passed 50K miles a few weeks ago.  Put on first set of new tires aside from the originals.  Still no problems other than above.
*Update 7.14.19
Seems that synthetic oil makes some difference for gas mileage.   Worth it for that and longevity of the engine as well.  The steel wheels have been found to be weak and easily bent when potholes are hit. Never experienced that on a car before, as usually the wheels can take the hits.  Still has not had any other repairs other than what was mentioned above.  Keep up with the maintenance and not only will this car be reliable, but according to my calculations, this is probably the least expensive car, all things considered that you can own, either in 2012 or 2019!

fiat,500,2012,Anthony, 01/30/2018,Love my Fiat 500 C Pop,5,"I have owned several Fiats through the years and i can honestly say, they are misunderstood. I have had a 1974 124 Sport, which was fun as could be to drive. I owned a 1980 Fiat 2000 Spider convertible ( also known as a 124). That was  a blast to drive. I went through a midlife crisis and got another 1981 Fiat Spider convertible, this will always put a smile on your face, something about the top down and the wind in your hair and face. Forward to the 2012 Fiat 500C Pop, what a great design to put a cloth retractable top inside the roof pillars, much safer and way cooler. The car rides and feels like a big car, it is very solid and sure footed. I am 6 foot 1 and have plenty of room and I find the front seating extremely roomy and comfortable. I always sit in the back whenever i purchase a vehicle to see how much headroom and legroom my less fortunate passengers will have. While i am an empty nester, i tend to flop the rear seats down and create a nice little cargo hauling area that is very practical for hauling my two dogs around or for groceries. I bought my car used with 20,000 miles on it in 2014, i have since put 60,000 miles with regular oil changes and tire rotations. i have changed my own spark plugs twice, which is fairly simple, as is changing the air filter and cabin filter.  I purchased an aftermarket warranty, but I have never needed to use it. There was a recall on a manual clutch spring replacement, where they also have to replace the brake sensor, but that was covered under the recall. I am sad that the cars do not hold their resale value, but I believe that the 500 C model was done correctly. I know there have been alot of complaints with the 500 L 4 door, but that is a different engine and model altogether. I love my 500C Pop convertible manual transmission. If you dont know about manual transmissions, they are the best kept secret. They are a lot more fun to drive. You are more involved with the driving experience and that is what you are doing driving! therefore one tends to pay more attention. I spoke with a used car salesman recently and he stated that he specifically bought a manual transmission vehicle for his daughter.... Because she would not be able to text and drive!  She was initially upset.. but she thanked him later for this. Something to think about. I have had my Fiat up to 101 MPH and it rides the same at all speeds, 50-70 is the perfect speed for this vehicle, I cant stress enough ,  the big car feel. This is something American cars are getting better at, but I honestly do not know if I will ever buy American. I have owned several German cars and brands and there is nothing quite like their feel for the road, however reliablity and parts and pricing is a different story.  I have owned Japanese and Korean and found them to be the most reliable. To make a long story short, on a beautiful day with the top down and a nice day trip planned with you and that special someone, I highly reccomend that you take the route less traveled in the vehicle (Fiat 500C Pop, Manual) less driven. You will not be disappointed. Just do your homework and check the car fax maintenance records.  Good solid car, great gas mileage, unlimited smiles and Italian sexy.

fiat,500,2012,Joshua McDonald, 12/18/2015,Great car with a lot of small issues,2,"Would be a great car if the interior quality was a little better, if you get the convertible then be aware that the light color headliner suffers from discoloration in the rear and that Fiat and the dealers will not correct the issue, instead blaming it on dust that gets on the interior. You will be going to the shop for small things and they will add up over time.

fiat,500,2012,winthrop53@gmail.com, 08/24/2015,Trading in,2,"I got a letter for a blow out sale so I drove my Fiat to the dealership and I was fortunately able to get a new loan for a 500L.  I got a great deal on the new car but the trade in on my 2012 Fiat Pop was really low due to issues pertaining to the clutch and the engine noise.  After reading some other reviews I am apparently not the only one with these issues.  Someone else had to get a new clutch under 40,000 and mine has only 34,000. Also another review complained about changing spark plugs and their costs at an early mileage. I just had to replace mine. The engine noise just got so loud in the last few months - out of nowhere.  Service kept telling me it is a Fiat.? Again in another review the engine noise gave them a headache. Then there is the electrical.  Tire monitor light went on after 15,000, some sort of electrical problem.  I had the same problem mentioned in a review. I was constantly checking my air pressure.  Service couldn't help. They just would check the air pressure and say it is fine.  I had to replace both headlights at 34,000, also mentioned in another review and of course replacing the hub caps two or three times a year at $55.00 a piece.  Hope I have better luck with the 500L. Risky getting another Fiat but financially  I was stuck due to low trade in value.

With the manual transmission have more then enough power to run 80-90 plus on highways.Juke in and out of traffic and can park it anywhere with the keys in it because nobody knows how to drive a manual and it’s too small to be stolen.

The 500 sport is a winner for me.
Very reliable, very peppy & fun to drive, very economical, and very beautiful.
I get 44 mpg on highway drives with the A/C on...this car easily exceeds the EPA rating for highway milage.
Driving in the city is closer to the EPA rating (30-32 mpg in true bumper to bumper city driving).
Even though I did not have a big budget, I am very happy I bought the Sport with a few options (18,600) and not the Pop.
The sport has exceptionally comfortable seats and adds so much extra equipment for a small premium that it was worth getting over the Pop...I strongly recommend this car to everyone who admires it."
fiat,500,2012,D. Brochu, 12/23/2018,7 Years in and here are the list of problems:,1,"Stay away from the Fiat brand. They were given the opportunity to enter the market and back their brand and they have failed miserably.  I purchased a new 2012 Fiat 500 Sport in July 2011.  The instrument cluster failed immediately and needed to be replaced.  The car was kept for a week and Fiat refused to provide a loner.  The rear license plate light failed and Fiat never issued a recall for this known issue.  The sunroof has failed (will not open or close - fuse is fine). The door handle pulled off the door and needed to be replaced (plastic garbage). The car intermittently will not crank - fortunately it's a standard and I can push start the POS. The cruise control intermittently will not function. The digital clock is fast (yeah, in the 21st century they can't even get that right). I've kept records showing that the car has been brought in for all scheduled maintenance.  As of 85K miles, in addition to scheduled maintenance, I have had to replace the wheel bearings. Shift boot rips because the geniuses who thought fastening the top with a ty-wrap did not consider the sharp edge left behind which would eventually rip through the shift boot.  Driver's side seat cover ripped at about 15K miles (I weigh 160 lbs). NOTE: Performance sub categories available were all checked OK with the main category - 1 star because all sub categories are CONTINGENT ON THE CAR STARTING.  I've recorded all of the telephone calls with Fiat's incompetent customer service group and the attitude from the folks at the other end of the line is laughable.  Contrast Fiat's brand with my 2001 Ford Ranger that starts EVERY TIME and has been worth every penny. Bottom line is - if you're going to purchase a Fiat you're going to need to purchase a spare vehicle.

I had read that the manual gets better MPG, so took the time to learn manual (automatic drive is like spellcheck, no one 27 and under has ever had to live without it). The clutch on this car is incredibly light, but once you get used to it, is a total blast. The base model comes with a lot of standard features, and the blue&me system is fantastic. The car turns on a dime, and for having such a small engine is actually really zippy. Even though its tiny, it feels spacious- my 'big man' friends have no problem getting in and out of the car.

It's comfortable, and Mr. 6'2"" CAN fit into the pax seat.

fiat,500,2012,Abigail, 05/15/2017,Looks aren't everything,2,"I bought this car used at two years old with 24,000 miles. The car runs well and has not given me any engine trouble thus far. The problem with this car is that it is cheaply made. For example the first to happen was that the plastic hubcaps broke off and rolled away while I was driving it and all in a short period of time from one another. The rear view mirror started wobbling and bobbing while I was driving. We've now had to rig it to stay still. I won't touch it in fear that it will brake. The armrest has zip ties holding it in place. The ""leather"" thing to the shifter is not attached to the base anymore. And the worst thing is that the front vents to the air conditioner do not work anymore. It is like they're blocked. We have that rigged, as well, to have some air conditioning considering we live in the desert. To add to the vents not working the instrumentation for the air conditioning is faulty and now only has a choice of 2 speeds (1 and 3) and off. I cannot wait to get rid of this vehicle,  but I will be upside down on it when I trade it in because what I owe is more than what it is worth.

Set your expectations low, the interior is not primo, but if that's what you want then save up for something more upscale.  The interior has some character but is definitely basic.  The seats are sporty and the fabric feels robust.  Racing Stripes, Racing stripes!  How did they get inside my car again?  The seats have a single red stripe going longways, I'll keep em.  I use this car to commute through city streets and park it on the curb.  Those big rims will get scratched, hail will damage the steel roof and eventually someone will drive their car into my car followed by driving their car away.  Such is life.  This is a more fragile car than anything I've had, the intercoolers are in the edges of the front bumper, meaning a fender bender will cost f$ht dollars.  The brake calipers are within fingers reach of any passerby.  Putting new tires on will scratch the rims very badly if you don't go out of your way to find a specialty shop.  All that aside, this car rocks.  It makes a unique exhaust sound, seems like it has never made the same sound twice.  whirrrrr, whistle, growl, pop burble.  Rippin through the corners and being a tiny car, 5 speed rowing and being such an unconventional car.

Headlights went out, cost over $800.00 to repair, had to replace some electrical board. License plate light is out , cost over 300.00 to replace. Manual transmission it is hard to shift. There was a recall still hard to shift. Had to replace the stick shift boot because the base came a part.  And, the thing about the stick shift boot is it was replaced with a a very nice high quality boot that I had to pay for. Now at 77,000 miles the left boot is torn another $800.00 plus to replace. I have had more issues with this car but don’t have time to keep going. This car is of poor quality. Everything is put together with plastic clips.  My suggestion, find another cute car. Fiat sales are down, and the reason is this car is a piece of junk! Don’t waste your time.

fiat,500,2012,No, 10/01/2019,No recall repairs,1,"My 2012 fiat 500 pop has had many recalls since it's wheels hit the streets. Early September of 2019, driving down the road to get my child from school, my clutch petal sticks to floorboard, I managed to get it back up, pop the car in Neutral, and try to shift it into first, WHILE IN MOVING TRAFFIC!. I get it to the school, and once again the petal goes to the floorboard, only this time I had the option to get into a parking spot, and quick.. I'm  trying to get the petal off the floorboard, car is in natural, and all of a sudden my car had a nasty rubber/plastic smell. I completely turn off the car, proceeding to get my daughter from school. Apon further investigation thanks to Google, I come across a few recalls, one which was still open, sounded like everything that just happened. The car sat at the school for 24 hours until late I could get arrangements on where it was going and what the cost to get it there was going to be. We get the okay to have it sit in ""carmax"" whom I purchased the car from, for 72 hours with a parking pass. The following day, I get information about Stateline Maserati in Fort Mill N.c would take the vehicle and run a recall diagnosis to see if it was covered for the recall. ""Ashley"" tells me, they will look at it, reimburse my towing and cover a loaner, IF it is covered by the recall. So I get it there, 99.00 flat for a tow, no I don't have AAA, or an extended warranty. And my Case worker, not ""Ashley"" ""Rebecca "" tells me I was given false information, they will cover loaner and tow BUT tow has togo through Fiat, and a loaner is only covered for the first 24hrs. I pay for anything there after. Depending on ""what they gave me"" ranging from 30 to 50 a day.... I denied any loaners because it's a Friday, so my cat is going to sit till Monday, I now have a 200$ rental if I had taken it. So no.. so after they call me at 3:38 pm Monday afternoon, "" Rebecca"" proceeds to tell me that "" The recall states for a missing component to be installed onto the clutch/ and or clutch petal, therefore since my clutch and clutch petal is the issue, it is not covered by the recall. I called her bluff, and stated to her, that's not correct, the current recalled as of 2016 FCA stated it was a clutch petdal assembly pedal  travel limiter and a clutch  pedal switch.  After telling me no, that's not what it states, I told her I would call fiat and ask them to call there office, so on September 25th I called fiat, a day after the dealership, and told fiat the same issue, they gladly opened a claim... NEVER GOT BACK TO ME. So here it is the 30th of September and I've had to do all the calling to relieve any answers. No fiat will not repair the recall, and I quote, under the dealership diagnosis they ran, we spoke to a manager at that location about your vehicle and he stated the clutch is covered with the recall, but they believe the clutch went out first, so you'll have to replace the clutch before they will fix your recall... my answer, WHAT? so I've been waiting on a phone call from fiat, and or the dealership to call me back regarding MY CAR and I have to call 5 days later to find out this information? When was this information stated? She replied, the 25th ma'm.. COOL. So tell me how they ""detected"" my clutch went out first? As I was driving down the road and my pedal sticks to the floorboard, making it impossible for me to maintain the proper speed or Matlin a safe way to get off the road, No? The clutch went out after... Needless to say, fiat wants to own up to NO OWNERSHIP  of the recall. So I either have to surrender my vehicle, or get it appraised as it, and HOPE I get another vehicle in return... going on 3 weeks, and fiat can not tell me anything, other than, we see here we sent out recall letters? Okay, I haven't gotten one, can you fax or mail me the last one on record to the last known mailing address to see if
 that's even the correct mailing address that was on file the last time it was sent out?? No she couldn't do that either, because apparently the systems don't allow them to. It's horse crap! Now I owe another tow bill, to get it towed to its next destination, 3 weeks with no car, left me 2 days with no work, no help, and fiat telling me what actually happened when in fact I was the one behind the wheel hoping I don't die before I get my child from school. I will never in the history of never ever give fiat a 5 star rating. It doesn't even being in the 1 star radios. Thanks fiat!

All I can say that's truly unfortunate . So far my car has been running strong I drive my fiat daily commuting to work 60 miles every day. I take my car to my mechanic for its regular oil changes he also  lubes and looks over everything and every time I go to pick up my car he lets me know that everything looks good. Nothing to be concerned about. For those who take their car to the dealership and have had bad experience you're better off going to your own mechanic you trust. I have  the best mechanic .

fiat,500,2012,George, 10/25/2015,Still a Wonderful little car.,5,"Look if you want a big roomy car buy somethin else! If you want a fun, decent handling & very quick car get the Abarth. Took mine from Idaho to California & back. Lots of freeway travel. It was great. If your between 5' 9"" & 6' and of normal weight then its quite comfortable. Had minor issue with fuel vacuum line. Check engine light comes on. Took to dealership enroute.  Was diagnosed, reset. Was warned might come on again. It did. Took to home dealership. Was taken care of. You cannot compare this car to other outside its segment. So, for all the people that complain about how small it is and that its not safe on the freeway, then why did you buy one. Means that you didn't check it out to see if it met your needs. DUH. As for me I love this little Abarth. By the way I suggest buying into MOpar's extended warrenty IS A GOOD INVESTMENT. If your concern is everything falls apart after factory warrenty expires. Most car's do have issues here or there. Why do u think the manufactured brands only go so far with their warranties. side skirts detachment  had become an issue. Fiat took care of problem. Still think it is more fun & better than Cooper S Clubman I had. Seats way more comfortable.  Handles better. Sounds great. Everything remains the same as it maintains the fun factor. Performance  has actually increased ! No additional issues with side skirts. Looking at the 500X to replace my old ML55 AMG

fiat,500,2012,Kathy Upton, 01/05/2017,What a Gem!,5,"I bought my 2012 Fiat with a standard transmission to make a 120 mile round trip daily. The ONLY complaint I have, is the comfort of the seat after extended driving. Of course this could be due to my age, but I'm going to blame it on the length of the seat. The only work I have had to do on the car is the standard oil changes (get ramps, you'll need them to get under this car), new tires and the license plate light went out. That was fairly costly, as you can't just replace the bulb. The entire handle had to be replaced.  I am on the 3rd set of tires as the rear tires seem to bubble. I'm getting about 50K out of a set. I don't rotate them the way I should though, so I'm going to try that with this set. The car is holding up great. I had to replace the battery at 140K. The only issue with this, was there was no warning that the battery was failing. When it went I was at the store, came out and the car wouldn't start, wouldn't jump, couldn't even pop the clutch to start so it had to be towed. :(  I still love this car and if you can find one that is a manual and still boasts this type of MPG...snag it. Resell value is super low, but who cares? 
run it till it's dead and start over. :)
UPDATE: 2109. I hit a deer in April and totaled my Fiat. I had 175K miles. SO Sad! But I bought a 2015 Fiat and so far, so good!

fiat,500,2012,Ed the Fiat Owner, 09/06/2017,"Endearing, comfortable, reliable yet quirky",5,"This purchase was for fun, a cheeky weekend companion with a full-length cloth sunroof. Yet after 8+ years, my 500c is incredibly convenient when hunting for a parking spot hunt or for an urban commute. Heated leather seats are still firm and comfortable, its good sound system and Sport driving mode make it more playful. Top open, it makes me smile every time. The multiple positions for the top allows me to decide how much nature comes in. Exterior sounds are quite muted when the insulated top is closed, and it's remained secure and waterproof. The trunk opening is narrow, but reasonably sized for groceries or gym bags. The engine still growls in an agricultural way, but it scoots along. Fog lights are helpful, and the A/C is effective, though the compressor needed to be replaced and the fan speed seems to be less forceful. Gas mileage depends on driving style, and top-down visibility is poor, since backup cameras didn't show up until a few years later. Switchgear puts style over ergonomics, but I love the use of color and materials. The plastic door panels feel cheap and show scuff marks. My only issues in eight years besides the A/C compressor: some light bulb replacements, a new battery and tires, 2 resets of the top mechanism (fixed using the description in the manual), a squeaky seat frame, and a low front end that scrapes on some speed bumps. Overall, fewer trips to the dealer than my Honda and Toyota! It still looks good and runs well.

It is quite literally impossible to be sad in this car. With a manual around the city it's the perfect car! Fun to drive, and as long as you're not afraid to rev the engine, it's peppy too. Great interior style is combined with very surprising space. My head hits in the back (6'0""), but the leg room is amazing for what it is.

That being said, You should know that the center arm rest is ridiculously weak and should be removed before you break it. You should know how to drive it. The 5sp manual transmission in regular mode or sport mode is smooth. To make this car go you have to up the revs to 5700 rpm or 6000 rpm in lower gears to get running up to speed on the highway. However, the MPG is a little disappointing. I haven't seen 40mpg, but I ride it hard. Tall people can drive this car but tall people in the back is tough.

On the Interstates, it feels like the Fiat 500 could be run over by any compact American car.  The ride was rough and noisy.    I've been told that some people love them......but I think it's a standard answer for those who already have them.   I was teased by acquaintances who suggested I put the Fiat in the back of their car.    My wife, me and two suitcases were hard to squeeze into it!   Terrible car....and without a doubt the worst car I've ever rented.  Complaints to Enterprise went nowhere....only questions.   My objective would be to keep the Fiat off American roads.

The gas mileage is not what is advertised, the interior design is horrible, no center console, the visors do not even come close to protecting your face, the heat/ac when set on your feet blows directly, about 1/2"" from your driving ankle so it either burns your ankle or freezes it.
And do not let the wind blow at all because you cannot hold the car on the roadway.

fiat,500,2012,Joel, 10/12/2017,A smile that lasts a lifetime,5,"First off, my car was purchased on a whim I didn’t do any research before buying it. I didn’t need the car as I already had an suv. I was bored one day drove down to the Fiat store and the rest is history. I bought a 2015 brown fiat 500 pop. 101 hp, now it does feel underpowered in automatic mode, but I drive it in the manual mode all the time and I get better response time. So I think 101hp is manageable. I commute between towns which is about 90 miles one way. I average 36mpg on the commute! Bout $20-25 fills the tank which gets me about 364 miles give or take. The engine is stock for now, I am playing with the idea of trading it in for an Abarth. However, for what the pop offers, it’s a solid car! I use the pump under the drivers seat all the time to fill my tires with air, I love the convenience of this on board pump. Blue tooth is very handy to have when driving. I feel safe driving the car, it handles turns like a go cart! Plenty of storage with the back seat down. I fit a 55” tv in it once for a local move I made, desperate times call for desperate measures! Cup holders are a bit annoying, but it’s a small car, so I guess this is the best I’ll get out of the car. Vehicle is cheap on repairs! If your mechanically inclined like me, you can save money doing things yourself. I get comments all the time, regarding how cute it looks, or how does it handle, is it good on gas? I would for sure buy the car again! I have not been stranded once other than to replace the battery. Ac blows cold and quick, it does help to have tinted windows. I also have a VW Golf TDI, which our performs my fiat, and gets better mpg, but whenever I drive my fiat there is just this smile I get  that’s lasts a lifetime!

Yes, there's been some little minor issues like the arm rest cushion coming off and having to replace the hatch handle, but nothing major.  No electrical problems, never had a check engine light.  Brakes are awesome and it's so easy on tires.  (more than 50%tread on the tires it came with)   I did just replace the battery at 86K, but she starts on a dime and runs like shes still new.  Of course, I maintenance regularly, use Amsoil, and run non-ethanol gasoline when I can.  She averages just over 40mpg.   It's been the most reliable, problem-free, lowest cost car to maintain I've ever owned and I've been driving for 44 years. "
fiat,500,2013,Scott W, 08/05/2015,Terrific Car,5,"I have held off on writing my review for a couple of years (so my car is actually a '13) in order to see how it fared over time. I don't think they have made many changes since them to the Abarth. I did not give it a poor rating on things like ride quality and storage simply because the car is great for what it is. The ride quality is very stiff due to the sport suspension, as is the steering. It's what I wanted and what I expected, so it has not disappointed me in these regards. It is also noisy due to the awesome exhaust (which one dealer told me is made by Ferrari).   My only ""poor"" rating is on the visibility. Even looking out the front you have to be vigilant. There just isn't a lot of clarity no matter how you slice it.  Two other things I do not like:  no Bluetooth connect from phone to audio (unless calling someone) so if you want to listen to Pandora, you have to have cords. This is probably not the case if you get the navigation package. The other thing I do not like: terrible turning radius! Crazy. Feels like driving a boat when trying for a tight turn. 
These things being said, I thought that when I bought this car I would get tired of it after two months. It's loud, fun, stiff, small, fast, manual. I got it on lease for three years, so it was a gamble. Well, I have not tired of it at all. It has been great. You will get close to 40 mpg on the highway, and I average about 30 in mixed city driving. Also, I fit a Laz-y-Boy in the back! (Only because you can separate the seat from the back  with a Laz-y-Boy.) This is not a super fast car, but it FEELS super fast and it is a blast to rocket around. I will say that the turbo lag is a bit much. I hear that it is not so obvious in the automatic transmission. 
Also, Fiat often offers some great deals. I got this as a lease so had to pay the list price. The same car was on sale for about $4,000 less when purchasing. So leasing may not be the most economical choice. 
I have noticed that a lot of American reviewers are pretty hard on Fiat. I don't know why. Consumer Reports rates them with awful reliability yet I have not had a single issue. I test drove the VW GTI, and that is a great car, but a whole different animal. The GTI is faster, way more refined in terms of ride quality, but the Abarth feels like it is made for rallycross and wants to chew something up. It is just bursting to go when you put it in sport mode.  You can only get a sense of the Abarth by driving it and really pushing the pedal. Again, I'm not sure why it doesn't get amazing reviews, but I am not a car expert.  One person described the driving experience as ""driving an angry hornet.""  That is right on.
On the highway, it holds very firm. I have driven it fair distances and been very comfortable, but again, it is quite loud. 
I would seriously consider getting another Abarth when my lease is up in 2016, but the girlfriend is not in favor. She says it makes her dizzy and it is too loud for us to talk on a road trip. Also, the racing seats are not conducive to her reclining to take a snooze while I drive. So....a word to the wise. 
In a nutshell, if you test drive this car and finish by getting out and telling yourself you feel like you just got out of a cocktail shaker, this may not be the car for you. If, on the other hand, you get out and you find yourself eager for more, then you know you have found your next car. It will not disappoint.

fiat,500,2013,sruczko, 01/27/2013,From Pop to Abarth,4,"My 2012 Pop was a wonderful car and I enjoyed getting into it every day but I knew in the back of my mind that an Abarth would eventually end up in my garage. I waited for the 2013 model to arrive and then I went for a test drive - don't do this unless you are ready to buy one. The Abarth is everything I liked about the Pop raised to the tenth power. Comparing the Abarth to the Pop is like comparing an Alpina to a base 3 series BMW - you know the cars are related,
but so many components have been upgraded that it is a completely different car. If you appreciate what FIAT has accomplished with the 500 you are going to love the Abarth."

It's retro styling is so fun--it makes me smile every time I see it.
I love the manual transmission; it is fun to drive and very fuel efficient.
I average 36.5 mpg combined, and reached 44mpg using premium gas on a highway only trip.
I am still evaluating using premium gas in town, but performance is definitely worth it for a highway trip.
The seats are comfortable, and I love all the manual climate control.
The bluetooth works well from both front seats.
The standard audio system is really good and versatile.
There is good headroom without a sunroof for taller drivers."
fiat,500,2013,Rick, 09/07/2016,Awesome car that will surprise & make you smile!!!,5,"I test drove many cars looking for a cost effective economical car that would be a fun everyday driver while still be great on gas.  I test drove a Mini Cooper S convertible for 7 days and found it to be a noisy cheap car that really felt like a poorly built cheap car (shame on you BMW).  I looked at the beetle (just ok), focus (awful style), fiesta (nothing more to say), and many more, but just could not find the fun factor I wanted.  Then I happened upon a Fiat Abarth 500C and thought that looked interesting.  I test drove it ... and wow ... it was incredible.  It was perfect!  It had the fun factor with the exhaust note, convertible, 5-speed, and the power is great.  It also gets great gas mileage, low insurance cost, can seat 4 (yes the back seats are small but work just fine), feels solid/stable, and best of all a low mileage used car can be found for under 19k ... and then I find that the warranty is 4 years/50k ... Bonus!  I have since put over 25000 trouble free miles on this car including a couple of long distance trips.  This car never fails to make me smile and always a willing partner to have some fun.  On top of that, I get many comments on how nice the car looks because it is a limited edition Abarth 500c.  For 2013 there were only 250 imported to the USA ... so it is extremely rare to even see another one.  LOVE my car!

fiat,500,2013,mefitzpat, 11/10/2013,A Very Happy Experience,5,"I have now had the Fiat for 30 months. I still love the car. I have had no problems with it,  and the dealership where I bought it gives great service. The only complaint that I have is that with the stock tires, that it does not do well in deep snow. This is only a problem on my street which is not plowed.
If Fiat sold the awd 500x with the  six speed in the US, I would buy one.
After having had my Fiat 500 for two months, I feel that I know the car well, and can comment on it.
This car replaced a turbo diesel car, so needing fast acceleration was not a requirement. The first week of ownership, I put mine and my wife's road bikes on the back and took off on a thousand mile drive to participate in a week long bike ride in Northern Idaho. We had to cross the continental divide, and drive over many types of roads. This car has extremely comfortable seats, and except for the extreme climbs, has enough power. We averaged 35 mpg, for the trip. Since then, it is averaging 35-39 mpg with mostly city driving. We have had no problems, great a/c, and no rattles. Love this CAR

It rocks , fun , fast , stable, quiet , I've owned one of just about everything over the years from Pintos to Porsches , literally. This is hands down one of my favorites. My only complaint is that the turbo doesn't come in ANY color I want!
after 11,000 miles in just under 3 months not a single problem , rattle , or squeak . Maybe I bite the bullet and go for an Orange Turbo at the end of the year, anything but silver or grey . I'm sick of seeing silver cars ."
fiat,500,2013,holmgren, 01/17/2015,Great niche car...think before you buy,4,"Up front I'll say that I love this car and it is great for my needs.  But this is absolutely a niche vehicle that is lots of fun as a run-about but gives up a lot in utility/flexibility.  There is no way I would have bought this as an only car in the household--something like a GTI would make way more sense or a Focus ST if you wanted more edginess.  That said, I felt the Abarth had way more character, was more fun, and was more unique for a hot hatch.  It feels a more raw and simple than the competition--which I like.  It gets me to work every day, puts a smile on my face when I drive it, gets good gas mileage, and for short trips fits a family of three and groceries for a couple of days."
fiat,500,2013,Michael Gagliano, 03/14/2015,Italian Tardis,5,"I bought a used 2013 with 7k miles and an automatic transmission and use it as our ""fun"" car for my daily work commute. We've got 4 kids and our other car is a minivan so this Fiat is a much needed injection of small car sprightliness and tossable fun.  Great commuter car.  I am amazed at how much ""bigger on the inside"" (for the Dr Who fans) it feels compared to how it looks from outside.  Perhaps it's the tallness of the cabin but the front 2 seats are plenty big for adults, comfortable and well supported. Plus I just like that it's small.  I've owned an SUV and it always felt like I was carrying around a bunch of extra space back there.  Not so with this. "

By that time I had owned a very used 128 wagon, a new X-1/9 and then a new 131 Brava.


Each one a wonderful little car....as long as you loved sporting little Italian designed automobiles.

I did, and I do, so I was thrilled when Fiat returned to our market.
Then, when they tossed in the Abarth engineering along with a Turbo and strengthened trans, equal length half-shafts etc.
 I knew I was going to own a Fiat again.
Hooray, because I own one now.

This Abarth is truly a fun car to drive.
Sure, it has quirks, but like Fiats of old, they are endearing to a ""Driver"". "

And I've owned Dodge Vipers, Corvettes, AC Cobras, Honda S2000's, Mazda Miatas, GM Kappa convertibles.     I have the optional forged wheels with summer tires.  Handling is unbelievable.  I can stay with anything on a country road.   Sound is unbelievable.  It comes from the factory with no muffler!   Visibility is great.    Sunroof is large and far enough forward that you can see the sky.   Plenty of power.   It goes 140 mph.   Roomy, huge storage with the rear seats folded down.  I have the optional leather interior and it rivals premium luxury cars.   Bright, airy, a really great place to spend time.   I've owned the car seven years and had zero service issues.   Highly recommended.  Recently added K and N cold air intake, Madness 500 ECU module, and Magnaflow exhaust.   Probably added 40 hp.   It flies now.  Get one while you still can.

The wife is 5'2"" and I am 5'11"".  We both fit comfortably whether driving or riding.  The wife is the primary driver and loves everything about this car, the look (with the chrome appearance package) the acceleration (with the manual), the ride comfort (with the leather seating), the upright seating position for a great all around view, and the wonderful handling.  The Sport model is the Fiat 500 to get.  The Sport model offers much better handling than the Pop model, but does not diminish ride comfort, especially when the leather seating upgrade is included. Also, huge difference with ""stick"" vs ""auto""."
fiat,500,2013,sruczko, 03/01/2013,Ask the man who has owned all three...,4,"I never thought I'd be writing this review, but I am. I traded my 2012 Pop (which I loved) for a 2013 Abarth, figuring more is always better. In my case, this turned out not to be true. The Abarth is a very cool car, but in real world daily driving it was just too much for this old guy. The heavy controls, harsh ride (on the optional 17 inch wheels), and painful seats did me in and I traded it for a 2013 Sport after a brief ownership experience. The Sport works better as a real world daily driver and has more than enough upgrades to justify picking it over a Pop. I'm very pleased with my decision."
fiat,500,2013,charles hall, 11/19/2016,Stylish convertible with novel top,5,"I bought this car used two years ago. It had about 15k miles on it but the price was GREAT. I guess that's a caution if you plan to buy a new Fiat, but I got virtually a new car for under  $11K. I thought I wanted a used Miata but when I test drove the Fiat I knew that was the one for me. Not as sporty a driving experience perhaps, but a helluva lot more fun. The top can be stopped at any stage of opening, but has 2 built-in detents in addition to fully open. 1st position is basically a sunroof, second is as open as you can get without affecting rearward visibility, fully down is the quietest but like an old VW bug the folded down top is in the way of rear vision. Not really an issue out on the road but not the best idea in a parking lot environment. Styling is charming, capturing the retro feel but also seeming practical and logical for modern driving. My city driving in Sport mode yields about 36MPG. Also note that the storage capacity is quite limited compared to the non-convertible which has a full hatch. The convertible has a small trunk lid not a hatch. So I don't think this could be a grownup's only vehicle, but it's a blast to drive and every time I look at it or meet one on the road I feel happy! Reliability has been excellent. Only trips to dealer are for recalls and to add a conventional spare tire. Service here at Hendrick Dodge in Cary, NC has been excellent.
November 2017 Update: The car continues to be fun to drive and I have had no reliability issues whatsoever. I have yet to see another convertible I'd prefer.
May 2018 Update: Changed the spark plugs at 30K miles. Still runs great and love the car.

fiat,500,2013,rreichar, 12/09/2012,Hardcore Hatchback!,4,"Fiat was a sponsor of the US Grand Prix in Austin and had some Abarths on display. I really liked the look of the thing. Nice interior but not as quirky as a Mini Cooper.
For such a tiny car it just looked mean. A week later I test drove one. I decided that buying the car just didn't make sense for me. A week later I bought one. Sense had nothing to do with it. This car is loud, raw and rides like an ox cart. It is also FUN! I traded in the best car I ever owned, a 2012 VW Jetta Sportwagen TDI, that averaged 40 mpg. The Abarth seats look great but hurt my back. The shifter is rubbery. It could use a sixth gear. It only holds 10 gallons of gas. Go drive one. You will either get it or not...."

 Got a great deal on a 2012 Pop, wanted a 2012 Sport, ut they didnot have any left.
I had the car for little over a month.
It is fun to drive, with the 5 speed, I would not get the automatic if you are buying one with base engine.

I was very pleased with my 500 Sport (35000 mi) but longed for a bit more 'oomph' to play with. It's handling and overall demeanor was really good and involving but getting up to speed was lacking. Enter the Abarth. As someone else stated in a previous review, the many changes made to the car to cope with the added power turned it into a different animal. The power is there, the steering more direct, the brakes (helped by the 17""tires) are like hitting a wall, the shifting is more direct and positive. Short of driving a race kart on the streets, this is 'it'. You just have to hear the engine fire up. Love it! "

Great value, provided you don't pay the MSRP (I got mine (with 3 year tire insurance - which I already used once for a repair) for 19K US$ + tax with end of year discounts of 6K.)
Was considering other small/light 'fun' cars such as the Mini/Mazda Mx5/BRZ-FRS, but for similar performance/features it would be 10K more, anyway, I just kind of fell in love with it after a test drive.
With the 17-inch wheels and P-zero tires this light weight car feels fast and nimble, not always stable on the edge. Provided you keep it in the mid-rev range the torque is strong and turbo lag is not an issue. 

Update: now at 22,000 miles/3 years later.. still a lot a fun to commute with - still puts a smile on my face.. - added a GoPedal (major improvement to response/lag), Craven Speed Short shift kit (feels much better than stock shifter long throw), a Madness high-flow intake (actually made some difference to holding boost and also the turbo sound)...... tiring for long drives such as San Jose to LA - no telescoping steering/high seats..   still love this car.. concerned about the San Jose dealership closing..  so far it's been reliable (even though I drive like I stole it (when alone - when very little traffic/clear road ahead/back-roads)) - except some minor interior back-light issue on the air controls - fixed under warranty.

 I'm impressed and very excited.

After researching many used cars and new I was thrilled to pay $15,560 out-the-door for a new car with 4 year warranty, comfortable ride, fun ride, cruise control, power windows, usb, bluetooth...
 It does great on freeways and curvy roads.
The Sport button is especially fun on the curvy roads.
Parking and maneuvering is great.
 Excellent gas mileage - exceeds the 31-40 mpg ratings.

fiat,500,2013,Mike S, 08/03/2017,"Fun, Fuel Efficient and safe",4,"UPDATE: I've become a little less pleased with this car, at 67000 on the clock, an oil leak has developed, half of the instrument panel lights don't work and the odometer blinks
And I don't have a clue what that's supposed to mean. The driver side seatbelt doesn't retract anymore and the hatch handle cover fell off. I knew it was a Fiat, but I expected they would have fixed their reputation on their 2nd attempt to make it in the USA.

When my wife's' Hyundai blew up after a timing belt failure. We looked around at several sub compact cars that that she could drive confidently. When we tried the Fiat, we walked away from the dealer because the salesman tried to sell us one with a sunroof and I did not fit at all due to the decreased headroom. We later tried a standard pop and I fit perfect. The little Fiat was available in Green which was the wife's most important feature . Safety was mine. It has traction control, 5 airbags, anti lock brakes and great safety ratings. We were rear ended by a impaired driver on the highway and the traction control saved us from a potentially  horrible situation. 6 months later a guy in a mustang ran a red light and smashed into the side..(Southern California Drivers) Both times were minor injuries although I was banged up a bit in the rear end collision. It gets about 30 - 40 MPG with the automatic and is a great value. I would advise anyone NOT TO GET WHEEL COVERS and step up and get aluminum wheels or zip tie those caps to the wheel as they always FALL OFF. irritating....

fiat,500,2013,John Schmitt, 09/30/2015,I still love my fiat,5,"I bought my Fiat in January of 2014 and have put just over 22,000 miles on it.  I love the drop top which I can drop going up to 50 mph and my gas mileage is at 40.2-I drive 30% city and 70% road.  I live in the upper Great Lakes and this little bulldog is surprisingly good in snow, plus with heated seats I can drop my top and watch the snow fall inside my cabin!  After 28,000 miles, my Fiat has averaged 41.2 mpg.  

Now it is October of 2016 and my odometer shows over 36000 miles on it and I still LOVE my Fiat.  No issues to report other than a ton of fun!

Now it is October 2017 and I have racked up 51,000 miles on my Fiat-the love affair continues.  I have had only one repair on little cha cha cha and this is a new headlight switch installed.  The Fiat 500 thinks it is a big bad bold car stuck in a little car's body!

Now it is April of 2018 and my Fiat is still running proud and loud! Do not underestimate this little car's ability in snow-as long as I am not ""pushing"" snow the traction and ability to get around the snowy Great Lakes is surprising plus I can fit my skis inside. I love this little car after 56,000 miles

It is now October of 2018 and my little bulldog of a Fiat has turned over the 60,000 mile mark. My mileage the past 3,000 miles has improved to 40.2 mpg and my little champ has been into the Canadian Bush in Algoma. Love the car

My car has 22k on it now and I have done nothing besides normal oil changes/maintenance.  The car is always ready to have fun and everyone loves the looks/sound!  Just completed a 1200 mile trip with wife and daughter (yes in rear seat) and it ran perfect at 85-90 mph the whole way!  I would have liked a sixth gear for lower RPMs at higher speeds because at 85mph you are running 3600 rpm.  And yes they loose their values quicker than most cars so buy a low milage used car and you will have a perfect car.

It was my first used car since the mid 90s. A used Fiat 500 can be a great deal. Things I love: this car has great attention to detail in it's design - it has character and little things that delight, like the white instruments, controls, and steering wheel that make it feel unlike any other car available. The 2013 model has my favorite version of the interior because the dash lights are all orange and match; later models went to a different set of instruments that don't match the radio colors. I've put almost 10,000 miles on mine now going back and forth to work, the gym, and running errands - it has the easiest driving manual transmission I've ever owned and the electric power steering is a pleasure around town. I can always wedge it into that parking spot nobody else can use. You can drive it all out and never get into much trouble, and it has plenty of power for the freeway. The iPod integration, Bluetooth, and stereo are excellent and easy to use. On the down side - the seats have short bottoms and are not the most comfortable things, though that may be personal. Due to the short wheelbase, it can have a busy, sometimes nervous ride compared to a larger car. I feel quite content zipping around town with my little Fiat - it makes me smile. Like most of us, it's faults are the mirror image of it's strengths. I get impeccable, attentive service from my dealer (Fiat of Kirkland, WA).

It was not a complete dog like the regular mini cooper and I loved the extra space that the MX5 did not have. I can go to the grocery store in the Fiat! About 9 months ago I purchased an Abarth. Best idea I ever had. I have a 45 minute commute each way in traffic. The car zips in and out of traffic and I have had no mechanical problems. I have driven many of my friends Mini S, which cost a lot more (I paid $19,000 for new Abarth at year end clearance sale). Abarth drives so much better and the sound is spectacular.

Only things replaced are tires at 40K miles and general maintenance.

They're super fun to drive, full of character, have great aftermarket support and turn plenty of heads. Mine has 34k miles with a few engine modifications and has been dead reliable. It's a little short on space and has a lot of cheap plastic on the inside (as to be expected from a car with subcompact economy car bones) though this never bothered me as I understood what I was buying. The big catch is that these are not a spectacular deal brand new with the price tag, however the depreciation makes these a stellar bargain with clean, low mileage examples with leftover factory warranty selling sometimes $10k less than new. If this is a unit you plan on keeping for years to come, then go for it. If this is a car you plan turn around and sell a year after your purchase be ready to take a tremendous hit due to depreciation.

fiat,500,2013,Danny M, 08/03/2018,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY ONE. PLEASE!,1,"Bought last year with 4000 miles on it. No it’s not a miss print, a 2013 with 4K on it. 4 days after owning the car it started to make a ticking noise. Brought it back to the dealer, on the way to the dealer a boost hose came apart, I limped it into the dealer ship. 3 days of diag later they say the inputshaft bearing went out on the transmission. So they put a transmission in it and fix the boost leak. 3 months after owning it the a/c stopped working. It’s been back to the dealer 3 times for that and they can’t find out why. 4 month after owning it the driver’s side window starts to rattle when it’s 1/2 way down. Bring it back to the dealer and they said the window track bolts were loose, they repaired that. Then around 12k the engine starts to consume 2 quarts of oil every 2k miles. So we start to do an oil consumption report, which is basically drop the car off and have a tech check the dip stick. Now we’re at 18k and on the last dipstick check the dealership calls and says it needs an engine. So they order me up and engine and now it’s sitting at the dealership. I also found out when checking out the warranty coverage at the last dipstick check, the selling dealership put an engine in it at 3k and never disclosed it at the  original sale. At this point I called fiat  corporate and started this process. The put me with a case worker. I wanted to turn the car in but apparently fiat does not do buy backs and they wanted to connect me to some one in sales to try to “trade” it in on another product. So at this point my warranty runs out in September of 2019, which I will be trading it in. It’s a very fun car to drive. It’s got snap and hugs the corners very well (after I took the stock parrellies off and put on a set of coopers) which buy the way the tires were shot at 10k. Basically when it’s not at the dealer its fun to drive. Would I buy another fiat product again, hell no! Do your self a favor stay away from fiat.

Compliments from male female young and old. The sound is thrilling once you turn the key. The 5 speed shifting smooth and let’s you throttle through each shift with ease. Mischievous it is and devilish too. That is why my license plate reads Little Imp

fiat,500,2013,Aaron Ewers, 02/09/2019,"Abarth model only 40,000 miles of harsh driving",5,"I never take it easy on this little car, I push it all the time, I perform all my own maintenance and it has always been extremely reliable. I'd suggest getting 10 mm taller sport tires on 16"" rims though for daily driving, makes it way more comfortable, a roof rack with a cargo box, keep it extremely aerodynamic though or you will feel a massive difference past 80mph, window tint for really hot days, the AC isnt powerful enough, and a hitch to hold bikes or coolers or whatever. I recently completed a drive from Davenport,IL to Denver, to Oklahoma city, to beavers bend park, and all the way back to denver then davenport again totalling close to 5000 miles! I brought 2 inflatable paddleboards, two chihuahuas, and a big dog cage, and all our clothes and whatnot for a week and a half and never once did I regret it, I got compliments all the time. I love being one of the only people with an abarth, the scarcity, performance, and reliability make this car one of my favorites I've ever owned.

P.S. once you start to modify it hold on for dear life lol

Chrysler advised that it only was warrantied for 1 year. Ridiculous!!!! I will never do business with Chrysler again.

fiat,500,2013,grizzinwi, 02/16/2014,Amazing car for the money,5,"I'm very pleased the Fiat 500 Sport thus far. Very comfortable for my 6' frame despite its diminutive size along with better ease of ingress/egress than its rivals. Handles well and is surefooted in snow. Fits in parking spots others won't.
Feature rich- AM/FM/CD power windows, a/c, heated mirrors, fog lights, cruise, automatic door locks, Bluetooth and alloy wheels are standard. Excellent fit and finish. Current incentives for 2013 models make the 500 a steal. This is one small car that doesn't feel like a penalty box. It brings a smile to my face every time I drive it."

I will start on a High note and say that it is a Blast to drive, sounds great, and is an amazing small performance car.  Now for the bad!  I bought mine used with 4100 miles on it for about $10000 less than a brand new one, $27,500 sticker price.  This should have been a sign that they don't hold their value at all.  I missed having a larger car and wanted to trade it in, they offered $14,000 trade in with 6000 miles on it.  Now with 16,700 miles on it I have had a brand new radiator put in it and have an appointment for a speedometer that stopped working today!

fiat,500,2013,p.f.sorensen, 02/12/2016,"Beware, Fiat is unreliable (2013 Fiat Abarth)",1,"I drove this car for 2 years and there is a problem with the rear axle. it is impossible to align the rear tires and the rear tires need to be replaced frequently due to wear. i replaced the tires at 20K miles and at 32K miles in spite of rotating the wheels.
Fiat provided shims to try to correct the problem but the problem got worse after the shims were installed. 
I started to have a problem with the shifting. It was a manual transmission and it became very hard to shift. i traded it for a 2015 mini cooper s and i just love the mini. it handles so much better than the fiat, it's much more stable. the Fiat swayed on uneven pavement. The acceleration on the Fiat is poor. the mini is so much more responsive and energetic. 
The Fiat mechanics were nice young guys but they seemed in way over their heads and clueless.

Power when you need it, plenty of room for hauling things. Actually, it’s my second one. I was also responsible for two other people buying one. No more. It’s been in the shop for three months now waiting for parts. Namely, an ignition switch. The dealer assured me it will come in eventually, but they have seen it take six months for parts to come in. That’s really a shame. I had hoped after two failed starts in the US that the Fiat brand would do good this time. Be prepared to no longer have a car to drive if you buy one. They may not have parts to fix it. Thank goodness it wasn’t still financed.

My car enthusiast friend fully endorsed my decision, touting it had the ""best stock exhaust ever"". It's fun to drive in the city, especially under the raised train tracks in Chicago - you can actually hear the car roar. Unfortunately it's so far from practical it's not even funny. Inevitably the fun runs out in a couple of months and you look up trade-in value to see that this car holds absolutely zero value. And good luck explaining to the car dealerships that your Abarth is in fact different than a standard 500. I really wanted to love this car... it just didn't happen.

I drove it for 16,000 miles and the shape of the clutch pedal, ruined my left foot. I wanted to sell it but nobody was interested in owning a stick. I ended up selling it back to the dealer I bought it from for just $6100 dollars. While I owned it. I was annoyed with the horn blow when you lock the doors. I wasn't happy that this car did not have a door lock switch in the car. The seat seemed to be on a slant. When I sat straight up I noticed that I wasn't centered with the back rest and The seat wasn't center with the steering wheel.  The designers most of seen these problems.

fiat,500,2013,Joe, 02/02/2016,FIAT Brand makes you feel foolish,2,"It will need to be repaired and don't expect a quick repair or a loaner. Once you buy you are are on your own, they are in no hurry to fix leaving you with the responsibility solely for making a bad decision to buy an infamously poor brand. Had electronic steering repaired several times (4) and at one time had to wait for a bolt to come in that wasn't included with the replacement part- 13 days. No offer for a loaner, no apologies- and was told ""off-the-record"" by one of the Chrysler dealer van drivers to get rid of it before 50K miles. ""You don't want that thing after the warranty is out! ""

They consistently make you feel like a fool for buying/leasing a Fiat by not offering to service quick, comfortably or with a loaner.

The theme of the ""fool that bought a Fiat"" continued to the last day of ownership when I called the local dealer (Ramsey) to return the car. The first question I was asked if it was where I bought/leased the car, I replied ""no"" I bought at a dealer 40 miles away (since moved). He (later found out he was a Chrysler guy) said that he only accepted ""his own"" customers. I replied I was a customer particularly since all my service and fixes for frequent repairs was done at his dealership. He hung up on me and I wound up driving 40 miles to return the car.

Sad part is that had he not interrupted me by asking where I bought the car I would have asked him when the Alfa Romero Sedan (April?) was coming out as I would have considered holding the Fiat a couple more months until it was available for sale. I happily wound up with a new Lexus IS.

fiat,500,2013,furys, 12/13/2013,Buyer Beware: 2013 Fiat 500 Abarth first year,1,"It stalls often and is disabled on the road. I called
Fiat of Denver Service only to discover Fiat won't look at it for over a week, with no loaner cars. I was told only Fiat dealers will work on them now -- not other nearby Chrysler dealerships. It's not like there are any close to home. We had high hopes for Fiat but are sadly as disappointed. Too much fear, uncertainty and doubt to risk considering the brand again. So sadly we can no longer confidently refer or recommend a dangerous Fiat."
fiat,500,2013,2013 Fiat Owner, 04/27/2016,Disappointed,3,"I'm so disappointed in my 2013 Fiat 500 POP. We have enjoyed the car for three-years. In the last few months, we noticed a ticking noise on the right side when the car is in motion so we bring it to Fiat of Manhattan for a check-up. I'm told the entire bottom of the car, including all the rims, are bent - as if the car bottomed-out - resulting in a repair cost of ~$3K. I live in NYC, purchased the car from Fiat of Manhattan. 90 percent of my driving takes place in NYC. I try to avoid potholes when possible - which are everywhere on our NY roads - and I've never hit one that made me say, oops, that broke my car. Now, the Fiat is absolutely horrible when it comes to any bumps. They all feel like you're getting hit by a cement truck. But for a three-year old car that hasn't experienced anything other than driving in NY, I'm astounded that the car wasn't built properly to handle what any other car can. So now we're worried that another three-years from now, we'll be doing this all over again because of a faulty, or cheaply made undercarriage. This makes me sad. I want to love my Fiat, but I'm so angry at the manufactures for marketing a car for city living but not backing it up with the framework of a vehicle that can endure city roads. Boo.

fiat,500,2014,Clif Swinford, 05/20/2017,"If this car doesn't appeal to you, you're dead.",5,"Fun. Fun. Fun is what you should know about this car. It feels fun, sounds fun, looks fun, and can be used practically as well.  I've had mine since February, and have put almost nine thousand miles on it in those three months. I'm someone who usually puts less than a thousand miles a month on my car, but this little monster keeps humming to me to drive more, drive faster, drive farther. It's simply the most fun I've ever had on tires. My one complaint as a driver is the manual shifter has a long throw, more like an old tractor than a sporty car, but there are several inexpensive (~$120) aftermarket adapters available that fix that nicely. So go try one. My car's not the quickest, or the fastest, but roll the roof down, blip the throttle, and you'll be caught too. If you aren't, call the undertaker.

fiat,500,2014,Brian Vinci, 04/26/2016,Very fun to drive!,4,"Update 10/2017: This car has about 40k miles on it now at 3 years old. It has had no maintenance or breakdown issues. Shows no signs of mechanical issues.
Some things that do show the wear are the paint. It chips rather easy and is somewhat discolored on the bumper areas, not too noticeable unless your washing it. 
Resale value of the fiat is still in the tank, even though this is one of the special editions of abarth, which is a bummer and the biggest reason I can not recommend buying this car at any price new. Resale is ATROCIOUSLY low. If you buy it new, you are stuck until the car is 3/4 paid off at least. So the value just isn't there on the financial side and I have had way better value in, well, every other car I have ever owned. Better off with a mini cooper, honda, kia, hyundai or toyota by far. 

Original review
I've owned this car for over 2 years when writing this review.
The good: This car is fun to drive, its eye catching , and people always comments on the sound of the exhaust.  If your looking for something fun to drive this is a good catch.  The cabrio top is great on non rainy days, really enjoy the air and blasting the sound system, which is ample to blast through any wind noise.
The steering and response is there,, it wont disappoint on the steering and grippiness of the road. Once the stock tires wore down I replaced them with Michelen Y rated tires which will last longer.
The stick shift is this car is super easy,, you wont have a problem even if your a novice. And the hill assist is money. If your on a hill and need to go from 1st gear, no need to rev the engine and grind the clutch, the car holds break for you for about 3-4 seconds which is plenty to get going (really nice feature) and if its not your thing, you can turn it off in the settings.
Interior: its a unique design for Fiat so theres not much in the Fiat line to compare it to,, its a nice leather finish to the seats and really compliments the white exterior. I get lots of compliments on the interior design.
Gas milage will vary depending on how you drive it,, if your enjoying that punchy turbo motor,, expect gas milage to suffer,, if your easy on it,, it'll realistically be in the mid to high twenties maybe get into 30s.
Parking assist is money and works as advertised
All the controls are easy to use, reach and understand.

If you want to know some cons:
Might second biggest gripe would be the stock radio head unit. Its really cheap garbage. Which is sad because this car is priced high when compared to what you get in other brands for mid-high 20k range. I replaced it with a Kenwood KVT7012BT, which is the best thing you can do. Not only does it allow you to adjust the EQ the fidelity, apps, screen size and capability is just better. Sound is well improved. The Beats system is junk and is pure marketing for beats, the consumer is benefiting nothing from this system.
Second gripe would be the headlight power,,  the illumination is underwhelming and in many cases will have you wondering if your seeing everything you need to be.
There are some blind spots with the front windshield pillars which when in a lengthy turn scenario have blinded me to cars that were there so you have to have your head on a swivel when taking corners to ensure there is no one coming head on.
Resale value on these cars is terrible!!! The number 1 reason I wont purchase again. If you buy it be prepared to keep it for many years.
I do find myself wishing for some illumination around the interior at night. Even grabbing a drink from a cupholder can be difficult when its pitch black in the car, so some subtle illumination like the mini has would be stellar. Especially since this car isnt too far off the pricing of a mini.

It really is a decent car I wish I could recommend. I have had zero issue with it mechanically. I had a family of four in it without issue cruising around.
 And taken several trips with 2-3 people in it.

fiat,500,2014,Patrice, 03/26/2016,ABSOLUTE WORST Car I Have Ever Owned,5,"Purchased a 2014 Fiat 500 Lounge April 2015 about 1 week after purchase I was going up a hill had stopped at a stop sign, after the stop I accelerated and the car although in drive would not go forward and just drifted back.  I had to wait for traffic to go around me and then drift backward down the hill until i drifted backward into a driveway then drifted forward in drive down the hill until the transmission engaged back into drive.  Over the next 2 months the transmission failed to engage 3 more times each a under different circumstances and each of those times when the transmission did engage the car lunged forward. Each time this happened there was someone in the car with me and once someone else was driving.  I took my car to the dealer and was told they could find no issues.  The problem continued so I called Fiat who advised I take it back to the dealer which I did and the dealer advised again no issues and had a tech from Fiat come into look at it and again they found nothing.  Fiat said there was nothing they could do.  The car is DANGEROUS, I also called Chrysler and got the same results.  Neither FIAT or CHRYSLER was of any assistance and offered no solution perhaps replacing with another car or something, anything ..not that I want another but at least an offer to rectify the situation.  DO NOT PURCHASE A FIAT car is unsafe and Fiat & Chrysler customer service is the worst I have ever had to deal with.

fiat,500,2015,Cameron, 07/28/2015,great little car,5,"I've had this for around 8-10 months, so I can't really say much on long term reliability, but its a fun little car.

No parking aids on my, but then again whats the point. just aiming it in the general direction is good enough. It's small enough where i can just go ""Eh, good enough"" and it is.

It's a quick car, and still has decent acceleration at 60+ mph. It handles and grips well, is a lot of fun as a daily driver, well at least when there isn't too much traffic.

The driving position is quite high, coming from my 98' BMW, but it somehow just adds to the fun.

I've seen people complain about the lack of space, and granted, the rear seats kinda suck, but there's more than enough room if you only need to drive yourself or one other person around, not to mention it just is a physically smaller car which I like.

If I'm careful, I can get 36-37 mpg between city and highway with traffic, could probably get 38-39 if there wasn't any traffic, but I generally don't bother with it. More fun not worrying about mileage, and even when being rather liberal with the gas it still gets decent mileage. Get's about the same range as my BMW did, I use a higher grade gas, and it still costs ~15$ less to fill up the tank.

I think the ride is quite good, though my dad said the BMW felt like a rock (never really noticed myself). It makes a nice sound making it somewhat ridiculous, but not over the top. It's not super loud or anything, but it's enough to put a smile on my face.

I couldn't be happier with it,

Edit
~2 years later, been reliable enough, it can go through a bit of oil, not a leak, just keep an eye on it. Also fairly easy to modus probably hit the gas more than I should, and I'm almost always in sport mode I get a combined of about 30-31mpg.

fiat,500,2015,Curtis, 04/20/2016,Great LITTLE Car,5,"If you looking for a sports car this is not what you want.  The 500 is efficient, easy to park and peppy with the 5-speed.  Plenty of room for 2 and I am a big guy.  This little car brakes and drives well.  It was not built for acceleration so even with a 5-speed is not fast but adequate.  My last car of this size was the Ford Fiesta ST which was more cramped had a horrible ride quality although much faster.  The car seems to perform better on premium grade fuel.  At a 10 gallon capacity on the tank it will not break your wallet to by better gas and performance is much improved.  I had a hick up with the blue tooth system in the car after the install of Apple 9.3 on my phone. I just disconnected the battery cable for 10 minutes and the system reset itself.  If you want fun and style this is a great car.  Space is limited for more than 2 adults and so is storage.  If you need a small car for mostly in town use this a great choice and 2015 brought some great improvements to the dash and radio.  I average 36-39 MPG all the time as stated this using premium fuel.
"
fiat,500,2015,b-Row, 08/01/2016,Awesome little commuter/city car,5,"I got mine used.  Fiat's rather undeserving reputation for poor quality works out for those of us buying used.  Car was probably 33000 with every single option available new and I picked it up for 14000 with 15k miles and 2 years old.  So, not the car you want to absorb initial price on.  Even if the price stayed strong like a honda, 33k would be a bit much for a car this size and power.  A great MX-5 could be had for less than that.  PRACTICALITY-  It can seat 4 as long as they're all middling size.  I'm 6'3"" and can fit my teen children and wife in there.  Not for long, but it can be done.  Not much cargo space on the cabriolet, but enough to do a grocery run without putting the seats down.  Gets good fuel mileage without giving up power.  INTERIOR AMENITIES- Beats Audio is pretty great.  I've owned a lot of cars and this has the best stereo ever.  I thought the HK in the Mini S was nice.  No where near.  Controls are simple.  Not many options.  Has an easy to access menu in the gauge cluster to adjust beeps and DRL etc.  Instant and trip MPG.  Normal car computer stuff.   Bluetooth is lacking.  Technically you can use it to connect phone calls.  But NO BT STREAMING AUDIO to the stereo.  Unforgivable.  Does have the requisite USB and 1/8"" jack though.  Seats (leather) are comfortable.  Height adjustable (a la VW).  Passengers complain about the rear headrests.  The rear seats are almost perpendicular to the ground and the headrests stick out in front of them.  You pretty much have to lean forward.  BUT... technically its for safety.  Safe isn't always comfortable. The arm rest is only on the drivers seat and is perfect for me.  My wife considers it to be too high (she's short).  It can be stowed if it bothers you.  Seats are bolstered but not straight jacket.  You sit high for a sports car.... but its not a sports car.  Its a hot hatch.  Good visibility.  you never notice how small the car is till you park it or squeeze by into the turn lane that's almost blocked.   DRIVABILITY-  I came out of a mk6 GTI most recently.  The GTI was almost too perfect.  It lacked fun.  You had to bring it to a track to get ""on the edge"" safely.  The abarth isn't an ""est"" car.  Its not the fastest, not the best in corners, its not the most powerful.  What it lacks in power and skid pad and rapid weight transfer, it makes up for in spades with FUN.   It must be driven on the edge.  You don't sit back and marvel at your speed through the turn.  You earn it.  It handles better than most things on the road and anything in its class, but it doesn't beat your brains out on rough roads.  It has a very sophisticated shock absorber that lets it soak up bumps and still perform.  The shifter is spot on.  Some call it sloppy.  It doesn't offer a lot of feed back, but I've NEVER missed a shift.  Only thing weird about it is that it will let you try to put it  in reverse if you forget its only a 5 speed and try to grab 6th.  When you come to a stop in a 3 point turn, if you quickly shift from forward to reverse you might hear it grind as the transmission spins very freely.   The ASC is VERY intrusive when ""all the way on"".  Starting from a green light can find you bogging down if you try to start quickly at all.  The tiny firm tires try to spin on intersection rubble and the ASC/TSC kicks in and cuts the throttle all but completely.  I generally drive it on ""1 push"".  That is.  Tapping the ASC controls put it in a ""sport"" mode.  It allows a bit of wheel spin and will let you performa an ""L"" turn with the hand brake before it stops you.  It still assists if you start sliding around a corner, or stab the brakes too hard out of a dip.  Push and hold the ASC button for 5 seconds and you're in track mode.  Full off as far as I can tell.  Smoke the tires, pull J turns, drift through chicanes, spin backwards into the gravel or trees.  Not a great idea for the road,
 but kicks butt on the auto cross circuit.  The ASC has saved me a couple times.  It has my trust.  The noise... OH the noise.  Pops and crackles.  Pull away from the drive up window and you hear the turbo spin up.  Build full boost at anything below maximum torque curve and let off to a satisfying after fire.  The car has NO MUFFLER!  Catalytic converter into down pipe, into a small flex converter---- 6 feet of straight pipe, T to the 2 outlets.  Its obnoxious in confined spaces.  On the road its not even noticeable.  No drone, just a very european crackle.  Blip the throttle between shifts.  Sounds race car.    The pedal box is perfect.  My wife automatically learned to heel toe.  She had never even heard the term before.  It just comes naturally in the 500.  ""I can brake and rev match without taking my foot off the brake"".  Its amazing.  The steering is responsive but not heavy.  The steering wheel could be better.  I can't find a perfect place for my hands.  It wants you to be at 10&2 but I prefer a 9&3.  The car has a bit of body flex and body lean, but nothing dramatic.

fiat,500,2015,Joel Rice, 02/06/2016,Charlie Brown,4,"Last I posted was back in 2014 when I bought the fiat 500 pop for $17,000. Three years later I still have He same love/hate relationship with my car. Let's talk about the cons first, 1. Cup holder are not practically laid out in the front of the car two large drinks cannot sit next to each other. 2. Car feels a bit under powered, however if you drive the automatic in the standard mode it does much better! You can buy the Abarth and have more power, but if you have a pop like me just switch from auto to the standard mode and you will be fine. I tinted my windows to limo tint, it makes a huge difference in the summmer! I don't have to run my AC on high, which allows me to conserve on fuel. Let's talk about the positives! 1. Small and economical I can park anywhere I want, people let me in to traffic because I'm small, and people like to smile because they think the car is cute. 2. There are many color options, and this car is customizable for those who like to tune their engines and lower their cars. 3. Gas mileage is decent I average anywhere between 28-34 depending on where I'm driving and the conditions of the road. 4. Maintenance, is awesome the only things I have replaced on my fiat has been the battery, left headlight and left tail light. In three years that's pretty good! I use full synthetic oil, and only put cheveron gas in my car. 5. Room in the car is enough for daily life, I wouldn't say the car is family friendly for those who have larger families, however my wife, daughter and I fit in here comfortably. I hope this helps you in deciding if the fiat 500 is a good juice for you. I'm glad I bought mine, and I would do it again!

fiat,500,2015,Shawn, 03/28/2016,"Give this car a chance, you won't be dissapointed",5,"The big deal with these cars are the value for the money. It's a very capable car when you maintain it and drive it responsibly. I drive my 15 pop with manual transmission 120 miles a day. At 19k miles I have had no problems. The car handles incredibly well on curvy roads, and it has adequate acceleration. I love flying buy more expensive cars on winding roads because they are over priced 2 ton behemoths! As a car guy who just came from a 300hp car, it takes some getting use to,  but, once you realize how much better the mpgs are (36-40highway)  and the handling improvement, it's actually more fun to drive than my 12 challenger. It has torque so going up bridges and hills is actually easier than other cars.  The interior style is a great way to be received everyday.  My car has a red and white interior and the wife loves it and anyone who rides in it loves it.  Much better than the bland silver and black also rans from toyota or mazda. You will be surprised how much you can do with this little car. it's a hatchback so you can carry quite a bit when you fold down the seats.  So in my opinion give these cars a chance.

fiat,500,2015,Kirsten, 08/21/2016,"500 Turbo - anti-Yaris, anti-Fit, anti-boring.",5,"The 500 turbo - slotting in between the non-turbo models on the low-end, and more powerful turbo Abarth model on the high end, is definitely a bit of a ""goldilocks"" fit for people interested in commuting. This is my second FIAT purchased new, and I'm generally pretty pleased with the car. My one modification is the exhaust system like that of the Abarth - a loud, open exhaust. This car will turn heads because of the sound - in a good way (it doesn't sound like a fart-can Civic from Fast and the Furious, but more like the sensational Alfa Romeo 4C). In any case, this car is a competent handler once you get used to the high-riding seats. It's easy to drive in stop-and-go traffic with simple hydraulic clutch that has nice progressive engagement, and a snappy five-speed stick with fairly close ratios. If you're nice, this is a car easily capable of beating it's EPA ratings, especially on the freeway, where I've seen averages approach 45mpg. And even if you're naughty, you're still going to struggle to do worse than 25mpg city which is great fuel economy for a turbocharged car with a close-ratio gearbox being driven inefficiently. With the seats folded you're going to be able to carry plenty of groceries, and even with them up, you can fit luggage for two on a weekend getaway. Yes, the newer Fiats can stream audio over bluetooth and have infotainment stuff, but that's not the point of this car. What this thing is is simple: it's the cheapest performance-oriented turbo car for sale in the US, and it's a real driver's car. Your money is buying not just the 240,000rpm turbo which pushes 15-18psi of boost, but you're getting a forged crankshaft and pistons, with oil sprayers to keep those pistons cool. You get twin intercoolers, an upgraded transmission, and the most notable thing - upgraded brakes (bigger rotors, performance pads). The brakes are among the grabbiest and firmest you'll find in anything for sale for less than $40,000. They are probably the best brakes, period, on a car that stickers for < $20k. All of this makes for a compelling little car that wants you to be happy and have fun. If you look at a grey Yaris, or silver Fit and think that cars like that are a punishment, this is the car you want. It's a pitbull puppy that wants to tear the face off of your coworker's Fiesta. It wants you to take the backroads and have a laugh. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and reminds you to live life and have fun. Now, a final word about these cars: in the same way that they're not boring Honda or Toyota products in the ways mentioned above, they are very Italian in one other way - they need a little TLC. Mine has had a few little things (power window motor needing adjustment, bluetooth software issues) dealt with under warranty. If you look at other reviews, people seem to lose their cool about this stuff, which is unfortunate because it can happen with any car. Especially if you decide to buy a turbo car (any turbo car, not just a Fiat), be aware that maintenance matters a lot more, as does paying attention to things like fluids. Turbo cars like the Fiat may use a little oil (consume, not leak)  between oil changes - it's a good idea to keep an eye on it. The sticky Pirelli tires that come on this car from the factory aren't going to last 50,000 miles like the crappy eco tires on the Yaris. But if you love cars, and are willing to spend a little extra effort and patience loving this one, it's get to to 50,000 smiles, guaranteed.

update 02.26.2018: my car has not had any significant mechanical faults, but I have had two dealership visits for warranty-related service. 

The first replaced a leaking radiator hose; this is a fairly common issue with these cars. Not a big deal, just got it repaired and was on my way.

The second was an ECU electrical fault whereby the car was throwing check engine lights repeatedly for misfires,
 etc., when there was no actual mechanical fault. They reflased the ECU after doing a lot of diagnostics to rule out any mechanical problem, and no mechanical problem was found. 

Fiat service does great work, and they do it efficiently!

Beyond that: new tires at 21k miles and 41k miles. New front brakes (wear related) at 37k mi. New spark plugs at 32k mi; really important for a turbo car. Given that it's a performance-oriented car and I am driving with high performance tires, slotted brakes, etc., this car has been really cheap to maintain. :)

2020 update: Just shy of 90k miles now, no major issues to report. Like any turbocharged car, it is important to keep an eye on the oil level (I check it every 700-1000 miles) and top-off as needed. No leaks, no breakdowns, no major issues. The factory-installed battery was replaced this year; it lasted about 5 and a half years from the date of manufacture, so no complaints there.

fiat,500,2015,powell4665, 06/30/2015,Great little car,5,"I was looking at another car in the used car section of the Fiat dealer. I liked the way the Fiat looked so decided to give it a drive. Turned out I really liked this cute little car. So bought it that day. Red with automatic transmission. I can see where some of the interior parts will likely not hold up well, but for the money and styling, I think it's a great deal. I don't really drive a lot anymore and this is really perfect for me. Comfortable, peppy, and fun to look at. 

This is a follow up to the review I did last year. I have put about 7000 miles on her, like I said I don't drive much and she is still doing great. I really have no complaints at all about this car. We even traded in our Mini for the 500X and we love it as well.

fiat,500,2015,jahbro, 11/02/2015,Really love this little car!,5,"I really love this little car! It is super fun to drive. Not in a super-car kind of way, in a goofy, balls to the wall, don't give a damn kind of way. It's always ""on"" meaning it's always ready to play, like a puppy dog. It is comfortable enough for long hauls and with the standard 16"" wheels it tracks like a little freight train down the freeway, really! On highway trips I'm getting around 33-35 mpg which is exactly the EPA rating and around town probably more like 22-26 mpg (much more dependent on how you drive it). The only thing I'd change would be to redesign the center vertical tunnel stack thing because it does interfere a bit with my knees (I'm a big guy, weighing in at 300 lbs and 5'10"").

fiat,500,2015,Bapa Fazio, 12/02/2015,Ciao Bella,4,"Inexpensive fun transportation. Replaced a 92 Miata with this and it's as much fun to drive. Not a lot of pop in the pop but I smile every time I drive it. Lots of front seat room; rear seats comfortable for kids only. Good manual transmission. Short turning radius. Small for city driving and rides better than expected on the freeway.  I like the styling, not a typical boring low end car. Only have 3000 miles so I can't speak about reliability.
Update: 15000 miles.  Reliable so far. Still makes me smile and lots of fun to drive. Resale value is poor but if it functions like this for 8-10 years it was a steal.
"
fiat,500,2015,Mark, 10/17/2016,Love it,5,"I've had my Abarth about 6 weeks now.  I park in a crowded parking lot at work, as far as I can tell its the only one on the lot.  It stands out.  Mine is red with the upgraded $500 sixteen inch wheels.  The best feature of this car is its compelling value and its unbeatable fun factor.  I was originally shopping for the Sport which I test drove and loved, probably should have bought for the gas mileage alone and almost equally cool in appearance and appeal as the Abarth.  But I loved the Abarth too, particularly the exhaust, badging, and leather seats.  Keep in mind the exhaust is great, exhaust porn to the extreme, great at drive thru's and underpasses, will put a smile on you face every day, best described as a friendly companion and not at all intrusive.  Its absolutely fab!  If I'm careful I can average around 35 MPG on a tank with 60% of that a suburban commute to work.  I keep it out of sport mode for the most part just to save on fuel.  The Beats audio system is good, very good, but I can't imagine the base system also not being very good.  I did not do the comparison before I purchased.  Seems all the 500s I was interested in had the Beats so I just went with it.  Also, no backup camera, but it does have the backup warning feature, a $250 option that I feel is very useful and well worth it.  Driving this car with the stick is easy and fun.  I think it's is the only way to go because of the gain in MPG and the fun factor.  Also, the fit and finish is perfect.  I examined it with a magnifying glass, no paint blemishes of any kind, no gaps in the panels or doors (as compared to my 2005 Maxima purchased new, a Nissan embarrassment for which I will never give them a second chance.  Shame, shame, shame on Nissan).  The ride quality is also great, no rattles at all, a little bouncy because of the small wheel base, but an able and compliant suspension as well as a handling marvel.  Road noise is minimal, this is a small car from the outside but doesn't sound like it from the inside.  I test drove a Honda Fit, didn't like it but was willing to buy based alone on Honda reliability.  The front suspension gave the impression of the wheels trying to come thru the wheel wells let alone the road noise.  This car may be reliable and have great reviews, but I don't see why.  It's a cheap car with a cheap price that will make you feel cheap as long as you own it.  Also, the dealer played the online bait and switch despite having the online quote in their very hands.  This happened at two dealerships within a week.  Done with arrogant Honda... forever!  Thank you Honda for being rotten, I think I've gotten a better car for a better price.  Also, the electronics are all that.  Perhaps all new cars now come with sophisticated electronics, but please be aware, this was an inexpensive car where the fun, price, and appearance are its strengths.  The electronics are a bonus that bring it up to the standards of much more expensive cars.  Also, the interior and electronics are intuitive and easy to use.  This is no accident, it is well thought out design.  It's not just a lot of features thrown together haphazardly like my Maxima for bragging rights.  This is a comfortable car in many, many respects.  The high roof line allows for more space then can be imagined.  This car does not feel cramped and you sit up high, its easy in and easy out which gives great comfort to my aching right hip.  I also looked at the new Civic.  A great car if you don't mind spending north of $27K for the one you want with the wheels you want, and you have to do the limbo to get into the darn thing for the privilege of nearly sitting on the ground.  Its great once you're in but you may need 911 to get out.  My hip and checkbook feel the Fiat is not just the better car, its the smarter car too... and better looking.   I can't say enough about how great a value I feel
 this car is.  Also, this is a specialty car and the dealer lots are full of unsold Abarths.  Most people I think will fall for the 500 but the real car people, of which there are fewer, will look to the Abarth with an appreciation of how different and special this car really is.  Consequently, huge and disproportionate discounts are to be had.  My car listed for $27,495 (no sunroof, no navigation), final price $22,295.  I think I overpaid and could have done better by about $2,000 without even asking had I used some online tools.  But I don't feel bad about the purchase.  I liked the dealer, patient and kind, easy and nice.  The follow up has been nothing less then remarkable.  I feel like I've joined the family and a special community.  The dealer followed up and FIAT themselves too after receiving several welcome gifts.  Any problems, call and a person will answer who is able to give answers.  I will remember this as a pleasant experience, it the car proves itself as reasonably durable which I think it will, then I'll stick with FIAT.  They have put a priceless smile on my face.

fiat,500,2015,Jay Denver, 04/25/2019,"Fun, Fast enough and my Favorite",5,"I have had my little FIAT 500 Pop MANUAL trans for nearly four years.  Bought it Sept 2015 when the 2019 came out and bought it NEW for $12k off the lot. Now Have 22k miles and nothing but oil changes and tires rotated ( a MUST ). Only CON would be if you want proformance then must use PREMIUM gas! I live right next to a 75 Max speed interstate.  In exchange for premium gas- My little Fiat is at 75mph at the end of the on ramp. I finally backed off when I topped 90mph so I really do not know where it maxes out at. And at normal highway speeds of about 80mph I get well over 35 mile per gallon. Yes it have pretty simple controls but much safer to drive that way! My only complaint is that at 22k miles I am due for some new tires. ( probably from screeching my tires in some tight corners having so much fun driving it!)   Now as all the reviews have stated-  drastic loss of power in the AUTOMATIC trans.  But you will find that in most automatics.  
Now those of you that want to question my experience in reviewing this car?  I am almost 60 years old and have owned dozens of cars. My first being a V8 FORD with 3 on the column, a Hemi Dodge Charger, a Corvette, a Datsun 260z ( yes, 260 for those of you that know the difference) an MBG, a couple of TR6's, and every brand of work truck out there. I have a few dozen miles driven as in cross country several times Tucson to NY and Florida,to Anchorage Alaska and back twice.  And this little Fiat is still my favorite! "
fiat,500,2015,reviewer83, 03/11/2015,"2015 FIAT 500 Pop (1.4 l gas, 5 Speed Manual)",2,"With a comfortable, well designed interior, excellent handling characteristics, and 40 MPG even without any hybrid technology, this is probably my favorite little car that I have ever owned. It fits myself, my wife, and my daughter’s car seat with ease, even being so small, and still has room for our stuff if we are reasonable about what we bring with us. It also has excellent technology for its low price. It is easy to stream my Apple Music subscription or my Google Maps directions to the stereo using Bluetooth. Unlike many other, even larger, vehicles, it is almost as if this car’s interior was designed with actual human occupants in mind, as it has plenty of drink holders in convenient locations, and all interior controls are easy and convenient to access while driving. In short, this car is an absolute pleasure to drive, whether on a short drive around town or a long multi-state freeway vacation. Unfortunately, it is not, and has never been a reliable vehicle, which really ruins a lot of the fun of owning it. The clutch pressure plate snapped and the car had to be towed to the dealership to have the clutch replaced within the first week of buying the vehicle new. The clutch is not sufficiently covered by warranty as a so-called “wear item,” but mine was replaced at no charge. The transmission developed a nasty grinding noise when shifting gears and the entire transmission had to be replaced before the first oil change. The car now has a problem with surging in speed when in first and second gear, that the dealership was unable to fix and says is “normal for this vehicle.” Trying to control something that surges in acceleration like a bucking bronco through parking lots is not fun.

fiat,500,2015,RoniSue Lee, 08/04/2018,"Sufficient, efficient, and cute!",4,"I drove a mini-SUV before this, and it seemed ridiculous to cart that much vehicle around just to and from work (7 mi. each way). I went ""minimalist"" with the Fiat Pop and I love it, so far! I get twice the gas mileage, I love the big windows and having such a great view of the parameters of my car. I'm 5'1"" tall, with very short legs. This car fits me well, but there is a lot of leg room to work with for those who are taller. I have planned a couple of large events, and everything I needed, including two coolers worth of food, fit in the back, with room to spare. I love fitting into tight parking spots with ease, and I love the look of this little car! NO REGRETS, truly! I will offer these considerations for others, though: the ride is noisy compared to my SUV which offered a nearly-silent ride, I have to turn up my radio to hear it over my AC, the road, etc., and making phone calls on bluetooth is ok, unless I'm on a really noisy road and blasting the A/C, then I have to really turn up the phone volume and yell a bit, to have a clear conversation. The tools for tracking trip miles, setting the clock, etc. are not intuitive, and the owner's manual is only minimally helpful for these. I see what professional reviewers mean when they say this car isn't as ""powerful"" in it's normal mode as other cars, but I don't need a crazy amount of power. Mine drives fine on the freeway, and if there's heavy traffic and I feel like I might need to do some extra lane changing, passing, or maneuvering, the ""Sport"" mode gives me everything I need. I like getting great mpg, so I only use that when I'm in heavy freeway traffic. Otherwise, the car drives comfortably enough for me at 65 mph without Sport mode. When I shift from reverse to drive, after backing out of my driveway, I have to give the car a second before I accelerate or I will sometimes get a slight delay when I hit the gas. It's not bad, and I've adjusted to this, it's just something to note if you're a demanding driver who can't wait a second. I'm truly happy when driving this little car, I gladly choose it over the bigger gas hog I used to drive, I love the eco/minimalist values it fits with for me, and I'm happy to be seen with it, even at work where people are judged by such things. If you want a tiny car, you're a safe driver, and you like keeping things kind of simple, get one of these! I have no regrets!

Started with a Pop, went to an Abarth, then to a Sport, and am back in the fold with a new 2015 Sport. Subtle refinements to the 2015 are much appreciated, especially the new electronic instrument cluster. I have owned way too many cars but I think the Fiat may be my favorite all around vehicle. FUN to drive, wonderful design inside and out, frugal with fuel, easy to maneuver and park, great driving position and sight lines.

fiat,500,2015,Neal, 06/04/2016,Get the Turbo if you want a little pep!,5,"Cool little car.  Perfect for in town and work commutes.  I'm married with no kids and our other auto is a mazda CX-5, so storage or backseat space aren't an issue for me because I can take the Mazda when I need it.  If the Fiat will be your principle vehicle I suggest giving some consideration to your stuff and people transporting needs, as it's not equipped for much.  Having said that though, I'm a big dude who is high waisted (long torso and short legs :( and I fit just fine in the front seat.  Also, I recently gave my teenaged niece and her two friends a ride across town and they said it they were fine.  I wouldn't plan on stuffing full grown adults back there though.     
The 500 offers three power/speed levels: base (101 hp), turbo (135hp) & Abarth (160hp).  I tested all three and found the Goldilocks fit with the midlevel turbo.  It's speedy but not as noisy or tightly wound suspension-wise as the Abarth.  Some days I wish I'd bought the Abarth, but then I quickly remind myself I'm not 25 anymore and can get a speeding ticket almost as easily in the Turbo.  It's definitely got pep, and as I understand it, is the same drivetrain as the Abarth, just detuned for 25 fewer hp.  
Bluetooth and HVAC systems work well.  The Beats stereo system isn't quite as powerful as I expected, but it sounds great and again, I'm not 25 anymore, so extra loud music with extra thumping bass probably isn't good for me anyway :)  
As sub-compacts go this thing has plenty of personality. If you're in the sub-compact market, definitely check out the 500.

Now at 25k miles  on red. >>No<< problems. Average around town 28 -30mpg (on premium) but have been as high as 36 mpg on trip ( at about  65 mph).  Quick with sport button on as it supposedly adds 20 ft/lbs torque. and you can feel the difference with sport button. All three dealerships ( Baltimore,MD, Tysons Corner,VA and Melbourne,FL have been very good overall.  I came from a 2011 MINI Cooper S 6 spd. The MINI was more sophisticated but the ABARTH is a true  hoot ,especially hearing the exhaust.  FIAT has reduced price to now start at ~ 20 k which seems quite fair.  If you are seeking a harder core and cheaper alternative to the MINI Cooper S then try this.  The ABARTH is priced closer to a MINI Cooper than the Cooper S.  I finally sold the 2015 Abarth with about 25 k miles and still not a single problem. Came to Florida and had it serviced ( oil changes) in Melbourne . I only sold it because I needed a bigger car but no regrets and no problems at all. The car does not get enough interest but have to say after owning two I would still buy a third Abarth ( maybe a cabrio) if I didnt need a bigger car.  Do regular fluid changes ( oil/filer, radiator, transmission, and brake fluids) , use premium fuel, keep tires at high PSI ( 38 to 40 ) and wash and wax now and again and this car will treat you right.  I miss the 2015 version .

fiat,500,2015,KJS, 12/07/2016,Owning two Abarths,3,"I have now owned two ABarths...a 2013 5spd basic car and a 2015 6spd automatic also basic . I have tended to like the automatic better and have just returned from a long trip getting 36.5 mpg at about 75mph average speed. 30mpg around town driving. The auto has 183ft lbs torque ( more than the 5spd cars)  as well which adds to the ease in drivability and it is a 6spd auto ( vs the 5spd manual). The car needs an update at this point (IE direct injection, a dual scroll turbo for quicker spool up, an independent rear suspension and it should have had Koni shocks all around ( now since changed for 2016) right from the beginning. The sway bars should have been stiffer as well especially the rear sway bar ( which can be resolved through the aftermarket.- a wise choice which does help minimize understeer) . You will need to keep the tire pressure at 40psi all around to get best performance. Mine had the optional 16 in black wheels ( not the 17inchers ) so the higher pressure was not objectionable. The car is a fun ,raucous ,unique little runabout but is only ""fast"" when in sport mode ( worth 20ft lbs. more torque when sport button is pushed).  After owning two I would not buy another unless there was a total top to bottom update as the original was released around 2008 in Europe. It is now overdue. Not many drive these so you will need to be dedicated.

I took out the rear seats(about 50lbs) and added Speedlab Rear Diffuser, also added a Torque Arm Insert which really makes the car feel more premium and stout. Go test drive one and you'll see why its worth talking about.

fiat,500,2015,Chris K, 09/06/2017,The little car that could,4,"In city traffic it is small enough to avoid obstacles, and handling on the sharp curves of country roads is more than economy, actually sporty.  Sure the 100hp engine will need you to do a bit of shifting to keep up, but exercise is good for you.  In the winter snow of upstate New York, the car got me to work sometimes even before the plows cleared the roads.

We just keep upgrading!  with my Abarth, I can smoke a Corvette off the line ~ then I'm toast!  But, I'll still have gas when I get there!

Well, I’ve now had the car for a little over five years and I still love it!  It’s still a ball to drive, and it just hit 40,000 miles.  I’ve driven it to Las Vegas many times with three adults and luggage init and it is a little crowded, but I can still get 40 mpg in it!  

I’ve had two knee replacements, and can still get in and out of it just fine.  I’m five years older now, and have a purple streak in my hair, and still race around in my Little Red Racy Abarth!

fiat,500,2015,Doug at, 12/27/2015,Fiat USA is NOT customer friendly!,1,"I bought my Fiat 1 year ago. I love the little car! But Fiat is not customer friendly. On 8/27/2015, my engine blew with 28,000 on the car. It took over a month to get it repaired and back to me. Three days later, I gave it back to the dealer, as it was not fixed. The 2nd engine blew. 3 months later, they gave me my car back. The upper management will not contact me. They continue to tell a CSR my options. 1/3 of my ownership has been in the shop, and they don't care. Buyers look elsewhere if you want support. My case number is 28015096.

I drive this car like a bat out of hell and my fuel economy averages 26-30mpg. It's not the quickest car, but the aftermarket for this is thriving. You will always find someone who has done something with it crazier than you have. I'm just enjoying tunnels and parking garages. I have no intention of ever selling it.

There should be an option if you want it tuned or not. Was getting on my nerves just on the test drive. The steering wheel does not telescope which is a must. And finally it's hard to believe it's 2016 and these cars don't have rear view cameras. Otherwise nice cars for the money.

fiat,500,2015,Vanessa, 04/23/2017,FIAT Customer Service is awful,1,"THIS REVIEW IS EXCLUSIVELY FOR FIAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. I had the worst experience with a certified FIAT dealership, LITHIA Dodge in Las Cruces New Mexico, 2 hours away from where I live, for a safety recall on the clutch on my perfectly functioning car. The awful service caused my clutch to fail completely. It left me stranded on the highway miles from home. I had to push it off the road and have it towed to my house. We fought with FIAT to have it towed back, possibly to another dealership, but FIAT instead towed it back to the same one. It took 2 weeks after that to have my car repaired. Two week of calls with no return calls or information from FIAT to know what was going on. We gave them phone numbers and email, but it was my husband and me who had to contact them to get ANY information.  The case manager misrepresented some information, that our case was going to be escalated and that never happened. Nobody cared that I lost three days of work without pay and initially they told me that I could rent a car and ask for a ""possible"" return. The customer service is plain awful. I hate to say it, but I regret buying a FIAT.  I used to love my little car, but now I can't trust it anymore."

fiat,500,2015,Cindy , 02/21/2020,Love my Fiat 500c,5,"Have had my Fiat for almost 5 yrs. No problems so far. I don’t understand why there aren’t more of them on the highway. I can understand if you have a family & you are limited to one car, this may not be the car for you because there’s not much room in the back seat but outside of that, this car is too much fun! I still look for reasons to drive this car outside of work."
fiat,500,2016,Brian Ach, 04/05/2017,My angry little car,4,"Here's the thing--there are a lot of cars with more room, better build quality, more cache, better reliability, and more room. There are cars that have way more updated electronics, navigation, etc. and are more functional in terms of rear seat space, ergonomics and the like. None of them will be more fun than this car. None of them will make you smile, laugh, look forward to driving them, talk to people about them, or write a review. The Abarth (mine is a 2016 automatic in yellow) puts fun first and functionality second, but don't take that to mean it's a toy or not a good everyday car. The automatic is a hoot (I own three other stick shift cars including a Porsche 911 in NYC) and blips the throttle with a roarty exhaust backfire when you get on the brakes. It pulls hard in point-and-squirt traffic when in ""Sport"" mode (the only mode you should be in) and hugs off-ramps like velcro to wool. It's fun. No one looks twice at your Mini Cooper S or your GTI. I catch people looking at this yellow bee all the time. The amazing thing is how good the ride is. Short wheelbase and stiff springs don't add up to comfort, but on the highway and terrible pavement, those dual-mode shocks work their magic and it is amazing. Seriously. Front seat space is good, visibility is great (a by-product of the high seating position) and when you fold the rear seats down (or delete them) it's like the world's smallest SUV. It's as much car as you want, but no more car than you need 94% of the time. Can humans fit in the back? Better than you think...but it's tight. Can I park anywhere? Yes. Do what I did--find a used one with less than 5K miles on it, with a full factory warranty, let someone else take the depreciation hit, and drive off into the sunset. Does the exhaust sound better than a Ferrari? Yes. Is it fast? Not really, no. Does it know it? No. It's like the chihuahua who thinks it's a Pit Bull, but it's tongue-in-cheek. It's fun. It's probably just what you need.

fiat,500,2016,Ashley Stanley, 02/02/2017,Great Car for the Money!,5,"The 2017 500C Pop is the same as the 2016 500C Easy.  I ended up purchasing the 2016 Easy, because there was one in a color I liked at the closest dealership.  This model is an extremely affordable way to have a convertible, manual transmission, cruise control, great climate control, and bluetooth (U connect is super user friendly, I've never had a vehicle with bluetooth and started using it the day I bought the car).  I have enjoyed shifting gears in my 500C IMMENSELY, and I'm sure the experience is similar in the 2017 Pop.  I honestly don't miss all the extras the lounge offers, because I'm not a fan of leather seats (freezing in the winter when I leave for work around 7:15 A.M.).  I also love the simple knobs for A/C and heat, as well as the interior air filter, etc.  The design of the interior is simple and intuitive.  Plus, the 500C offers the best of both worlds in practicality and owning a convertible.

fiat,500,2016,libero1@earthlink.net, 12/23/2016,Surprisingly adequate and just a little fun too,4,"Spouse and I found ourselves in a rush and needing a rental car.  The only car immediately available was a Fiat 500 with automatic.  We took it.  On a 100 mile road trip to the event venue, the car proved to be more than adequate to the task.  While acceleration was slow, once at speed the car maintained interstate speeds without trouble.  We drove 80 and even 85mph, passing many more powerful cars.  If you know how to drive a small engine, this thing will do the job.  It was comfortable for two and luggage space was adequate for a long weekend trip.
"
fiat,500,2016,FiatFanatic, 06/29/2017,Great Car for a Great Price,5,"I've been a fan Fiats for years, mainly because I always thought they were just so cute. When it came around to buying a new car, I was more inclined to Fiat because the bang-for-the-buck factor- I tell people that constantly, and it's one of the reasons I recommend Fiat so much. How many brand new cars can you get for less than $20k, taxes and fees included? Not many. One of my favorite things about my 2016 Fiat 500 Easy is the turning radius. The smaller size of the car combined with the tight-turning ability allows me to make a U-turn in the tightest of spaces with ease. It's zippier than I thought it would be too! I decided against the Sport and Abarth because I don't personally need the extra power (that, and it might be tempting), but the acceleration is just fine and SO MUCH FUN. Another one of my favorite features is the space inside- I recently went on a 6-hour road trip with a passenger, dog, 1 luggage, and a dog bed and we all fit wonderfully. Just fold the back seats down and bam, you basically have a mini SUV. I'm still surprised at how well this car handles in snow and rain. It's not GREAT in snow, but I was pleasantly surprised for how well it did in 2-5 inches. In rain it's fine, however I do find going over the large, unavoidable puddle to be terrifying because this car is small and light. However, it feels good to drive- what I mean is although the car itself feels light in snow and rain, it is SOLID. Whether you're driving or in the backseat, Fiat's feel like quality vehicles to be in. The interior is beautiful with the houndstooth fabric seats, comfortable, high quality, and durable. Sure, the backseat isn't the greatest for comfort as the seats are slightly firm, but it's better than you'd think. It's quiet, gets great gas mileage and is a smooth ride. My only negatives are that in cold weather it takes a long time to warm up, and the blindspot when looking over your shoulder at odd angled intersections is bad. Overall, the style, the drive, price, comfort/interior make me love this car so much. I highly recommend.

I’ve owned mine for 3 years and almost 40k miles and it’s been one of the best cars and nearly trouble free I’ve ever owned. It is definitely a little beast to barrel around town in yet it’s also really comfortable.

fiat,500,2016,Jeff Brown, 01/11/2018,It's a conspiracy,5,"Fiat is very popular in Europe and that success enabled them to buy Chrysler motors. These days cars are mostly built well and if maintained properly will provide good service, why not drive a car that looks good doing it? I think people tend to abuse a small sporty car like the 500 and then give a bad review, NEWS FLASH! Even though it sounds like one, driving it like a Ferrari In Affordable Trim is a mistake. Driving this car feels like you're going faster than you actually are so you needn't abuse it to get the fun Italian sports car feel. That in itself is my daily reminder of why I bought a Fiat, but in all honesty I bought it for it's super cute looks, I think the bad reviews are unfounded and highly recommended Fiat despite them.

fiat,500,2016,Adam, 12/27/2018,Year two required monthly drop-offs at the dealer.,2,"I loved FIAT. I loved FIAT so much that I worked for them and then bought a new 500 Abarth six years after working for them. I used to wonder why nobody raced these in any popular series in the states (there was one in PWC that suddenly disappeared after a race; why?) and now I know why. If you’re looking for a commuter car that has a louder personality, then there isn’t a better car for you. If you’re interested in a new car for daily driving plus autocross or track days (because it’s an Abarth, come on!) then do not buy this car. I was obsessed with the history of Abarth and his cars. I’m a member of FIAT Club America and got to meet Anneliese Abarth at our club’s 2018 FreakOut; it was amazing, but my car was off the road getting serviced for two whole months after the trip to Florida, which sums up my second year of new 500 Abarth ownership. Year one was amazing, minus a blown intercooler pipe, mysteriously cracked windshield, and peeling body panels, but the performance was excellent and made up for all that. Once I got a hang of the short wheel base and front wheel drive in monthly autocross meets it was beating MINIs, BMWs, Volkswagens, and WRXs regularly. It won me a 2nd in class trophy my first year competing in the sport. Year two was another story. Every time I went to autocross or a long drive something broke, including the Electronic Stability Control, the Anti-lock Braking System, the exhaust system sensors, the rear wheel bearings (at 18k miles), more peeling body panels, the infotainment system, and a few other minor things. The dealership service was second to none, never asking for anything when I brought it in to get fixed, but the two month service was too much for my daily driver. It’s for sale now and I’m even considering the 124 Spider Abarth. Will it be more reliable because it’s built in Japan instead of Mexico? Am I willing to roll those dice and find out? I just don’t know if I want to gamble like that.

fiat,500,2017,Brandon, 12/26/2017,Most smiles per dollar available!!,5,"I have owned this car for about 8 months and have put just over 6k miles on it.  I drive it daily in city traffic, take it for spirited drives through the mountains, and have taken it to the local track day a few times.  This car has never let me down, had any real issues, or made me regret buying it.  The dealership has been very helpful with the 2 issues I have had(a bad clamp on the A/C condenser and a bad clamp on the coolant overflow reservoir).  I am 6'2"" and simply don't fit in a lot of the sportier cars on the market.  I tried the MX-5, Toyota 86, and Ford Fiesta ST and this was the most comfortable to me and I don't even have to put my seat all the way back to fit!  Incidentally this car is faster than every one of those cars that cost at least a couple grand more.  My 8 year old that is 4 and a half feet tall fits easily in the rear seat and I have room in the hatch for a surprising amount of groceries.  The interior is good quality and I have yet to hear a single rattle or squeak.  The driver's screen is very easy to read and all controls are intuitively placed and easy to reach.  The window controls in the middle throw people off but to me it just makes sense since my hand is already there for the shifter anyway.  Is this the most practical or fastest car....not at all.  Will this car have you looking for any excuse to do a rev-matching downshift and cost you hundreds of dollars in plastic surgery to remove those smile lines....DEFENITELY!

fiat,500,2018,Michael, 01/19/2019,Replaced a great car,5,"Turbo charging changed the driving experience for the 500. I drove my Neon for 13 years / 180 K miles. I loved its reliability ($300 in parts outside of scheduled maintenance), and getting 37.5 MPG over its life. It's hard to replace a car like that. Saving for 4 years, I test drove them all. I came close to buying the Fiat 124, but this little guy had similar pizzazz, as well as being practical. Performance is excellent, even in Oregon's heavy rains and, though marketed as a city car, it was comfortable on a 250 mile trip. I read the back seats are uncomfortable but, if the passengers are under 6', it seems adequate and it carries 5 bags of groceries w/o folding the rear seats. The controls are well thought out and the speedo provides lots of useful information. The drawback is that the stereo is part of the control system. I would like to upgrade it, but best I could do was replacing the speakers. It lacks navigation, except thru a phone, and its voice recognition is inadequate at freeway speeds. For value, the car was CHEAP, $14K out the door (tax, license, etc). Fuel economy is OK at 35 MPG freeway, compared to the Dodge's 41. I don't know about maintenance, except oil changes are dealer-only, $100 every 8K miles, due to special spec oil. It is a hard car to customize, and parts are limited to bling. Mostly, with its pep, decent fuel economy, and 15' turning radius, it's a joy to drive as my retirement car.

Enough zippy power in town and on the highway. Plenty of room for my son and I. And in a pinch...two adults can fit in the back seat. This is truly an amazing car for the price.

fiat,500,2018,Craig, 11/23/2019,"""Get over here!"" - Scorpion (mortal combat)",5,"So I have had a 2018 for nearly a year now. I drive about 20k miles yearly and my drive includes driving through the blue ridge mountains. With me owning a 5spd and driving normal I averaged 38mpg. One the rare occasions that I have driven it on flat land at 55 I've turned 42-44mpg. The thing I can say is best about my car is the smile that I have while driving it. A freind has a stage 2.5 Jetta gli came back after a short drive with a huge smile and saying how fun the car is. The exhaust note is great for a 4cyl. Unlike many car companies the Abarth doesn't need to have sounds pipped through the speakers to sound great to the driver.
I do have a couple of younger children and they fit fine in the back of the car. I have done a week's worth of grocery shopping using the small trunk. 
If I can be completely honest though, buy one used as the depreciation is crazy. Low mileage used ones can be had for half the cost of a new one. At the end of the day life is too short to drive boring cars. A golf gti is all around better, but damn it's sooo boring. This is a car for those who don't want to be boring.

2020 update: The car now has 20K on the clock and I have yet to have a single issue mechanically. I have developed an intermittent rattle from somewhere. The car drove well enough the only time we got snow on stock Pirelli all seasons.

Loving our 500C,5,"Everything to love, nothing not to like-- one button retracting top (up to 50 mph)-- spunky turbo, vanilla leather inside, fun quotient: off the chart. Feels and drives much bigger than it looks. When we replaced our problematic aging A4 as 2nd car, my wife (the emotional buyer) and I (more practical) settled on the 500C going Italian all the way and haven't looked back. Frequently we opt for the 500C vs. our Stelvio. It is the PERFECT 2nd car as I approach retirement and an inexpensive thrill. In a way, we flip the bird at the consumer culture and are really enjoying the ride. While there are a few compromises (trunk space the biggest), like so much of life and fine art, our 500C is perfect in its imperfection. When the 500E comes, we plan too trade 'up' as we will be fully retired at that point in time.

fiat,500,2019,Swarden, 11/16/2019,Fiat Abarth: an angry hornet,5,"First, don’t believe the Edmunds review. The Abarth will be one of the funnest cars you will ever drive. It is not super quick, but it feels super quick and has a very solid suspension. At 6.9 seconds to 60 is .6 seconds faster to 60 than the base Mini Cooper, a second slower that the S. The base 500 is just .5 seconds slower to 60 than the base Cooper and at 8 seconds is faster than most of this segment. In fact, I can’t find a faster subcompact that doesn’t have an upgraded engine. 
The Abarth drives like an angry hornet. Geezus but it’s a riot in sport mode. 
Reliability has been terrific.
And I see a 2019 Fiat Pop I can get for $14,500 right now.

We had 3 Abarth and if mine is highly modified and VERY quick (or ""slightly"" fast), my wife's stock Abarth is a lot of fun and absolutely not slow!  The car is fun on any roads, canyon drives are a blast and gas mileage, if not the best in its class, is absolutely reasonable.  You cannot get a new one any longer, but if you are looking for a fun car to drive every day, you can get a manual Abarth for under $6,000 now...

fiat,500e,2013,bbergholdt, 11/02/2013,Fiat 500E rocks!,4,"Just leased this. Really impressed with fit, finish and fun to drive performance! Easy to exceed rated MPGe. With sweet lease deal, total cost of car is less than I was spending on gasoline alone, each month. Range is OK, better than others except Tesla and Volt. Getting by with included slooow 120V charge device, others may desire $800 optional fast charger. Costs $1 per day for electricity to drive 40 miles, previous vehicle was $10 per day for gas. Very impressive car, hope future models offer extended range and lower cost batteries. My SUV will last forever, now parked except when needed!"
fiat,500e,2013,pelegri, 12/16/2013,Great little car,4,"We bought the car rather than lease it and overall we are very happy with it.
The rear seats are very usable except for tall people but we use normally keep the rear seats down.

Very zippy; excellent acceleration, specially 0 to 50.
I regularly get over 85 highway miles from each charge but YMMV: less if you have the A/C on, more in the city or if you drive less aggressively than me

I've driven the gas 500 (not the abarth) and the 500e is significantly more fun than it.

We had to deal with the half-shaft recall and some additional teething problems but the fundamentals (electric engine, inverter, battery) all look very good.

The car deserves the awards it has received recently."
fiat,500e,2013,johnnymo1, 12/19/2013,Go dog Go! 500e is fun!,5,"1500 miles on my 500e. Lease $200 month. $2500 total down, $2500 rebate from state of CA. Aero environment 220 charger installed today compliments of State of CA. Est monthly fuel cost to drive 1000 miles approx $35 per SMUD utility rep. 500e total car expenditure less than gas and routine maintenance alone on my MB C230...like winning a free car in a contest. Enough ACCT 101. This little thing is pretty fun. Very spunky and quick off the line. Easily separates from ICE cars off green lights. Great around town car or 2nd car. I drove it 95 miles very gently today and had 10% charge left. 
Update 35000 miles still having fun..range is about 85-90 miles now..
Although mountain travel or heavy rain can really diminishes range...
King of the road in stop light to stop light around town stuff...not so fabulous  on the freeway...real cost to operate was about $20 per month at special utility rate offered..no regular maintenance to speak of just keep the tires correctly pressurized.

fiat,500e,2013,bradmtb, 12/15/2013,Blast to drive,4,"Leased a black model without sunroof in mid-October.
With the $2500 the state air resource board is sending me, the net lease cost is about $180/month.
I was spending $160 in my Tundra on gas each month.
I leased this car for the HOV sticker, and it's priceless.
The car is quick off the line, and it surprised me how much acceleration power it has at most speeds under 50mph.
I'm 6'4"", and fit not problem.
The rear seats only fit kids.
It's been freezing weather in NoCal for the past two weeks, so my range has been reduced due to heater and seat warmer on high.
My commute is 28 miles round trip, so I can get by plugging it in every other day with the stock charge plug (110v).
Luv it!"
fiat,500e,2013,jahbro, 11/02/2015,Great fun zero emissions from Italy/Detroit/Mexico,5,"I've had my 500e for a little over 2 years now and still love it. I have a 50 mi commute every work day and probably average another 50 mi each Sat and Sun, in general, and I pay pennies to drive this thing. I charge a mix of at home and at work (free at work from solar unit). I average about 80 miles per charge, but that's because I drive quite hard in my commute, usually going 75-80 mph. When I'm not commuting usually see about 100 miles per charge. The only thing I wish it had was a DC fast charge option, but otherwise very happy with it. Another 50 miles of range wouldn't be a bad thing either! But I'm not complaining, overall quite happy. I've only been ""stuck"" twice and both times I was a block from home and just pushed it into my driveway. When it gets to 0% state of charge, it pretty much means it, you've got about 1 mile left at that point. Also, love burning rubber from a stop, it's very easy to do, and it's funny because there's no engine sound, just the whirring of the electric motor and the squealing tires. Very funny.  I also have a Fiat Abarth which I use on long trips and for fun mountain driving, and the e definitely feels a bit different with all the weight down low, it feels quite planted and Mercedes like (not that the Abarth isn't planted enough).

fiat,500e,2013,Kirk S, 11/23/2016,Style is Electrifying,5,"I love the looks and handling. This would make an awesome commuting car; however it would be a little tight for passengers in the back seats. The typical downsides are minimal range (<100 miles), and takes at least four hours to charge from 'empty.'

fiat,500e,2013,Jim, 03/04/2017,My first used car!,4,"I have always purchased new vehicles so was quite concerned buying a used lease vehicle made by Fiat. But after a six months I am impressed with this little electric car! I decided to investigate leasing an electric while idling my V-8 in commute traffic, and ended up buying this Fiat. With the gas and bridge toll savings this used car will pay for itself in about 5 years, plus reduced wear and maintenance on my Jeep. The biggest downside so far is the lack of Fiat service centers.

fiat,500e,2014,Jimbo, 09/26/2018,Excellent value if bought off lease.,4,"Buying these cars off lease is the way to go. You can easily acquire one for under $10K out the door for a 3 year old car with under 20K miles. New car price (and only in CA or OR) is a staggering $34K. Off lease is a bargain! Being electric one always has to consider how you would use your car and whether you will have ""range anxiety"". I live in the upper Midwest so I see all 4 seasons. This greatly impacts the range of the electric car. EPA rates it at 84 miles, which is a good general average. Depending on your commute and weather conditions will impact whether this works for you. I travel about 53 miles round trip of mixed driving on 2 lane roads. Speed limits range from 25-55 mph. In the summer, I only use about 50% of battery charge which is excellent (better than EPA). But in the dead of winter with snow, I use almost 90% of the charge and that is with limited use of heater/defogger. There are tricks that I learned to get better range under these cold conditions such as using the heated seats (which work well) to stay warm and uses the 12V battery to function and not the main battery. You can then get by using less of the main heater which eats a lot of electricity/range. Remember too the battery heats itself to maintain optimal reliability and function and that consumes some range as well. That covers the range anxiety concerns which scare most people about electric cars. Other than that, this car has been dead reliable. Maintenance costs are nil given it is electric, (no fuel system, ignition system, cooling system, transmission, alternator, etc to worry about) . The low center of gravity (600 lbs of batteries in the floor near the back half of the car) makes it handle better than any other Fiat 500 with a better fore/aft weight distribution. This make it more predictable and stable in the turns. The weight of the batteries also improve the ride quality too, but the short wheelbase still makes it a little more bouncy when you hit real rough bumps. Despite the extra weight, it more than compensates with the electric motor which makes this accelerate much quicker than you would think. Electric motors make 100% torque instantly from a standstill. Other drivers are surprised when the light turns green and you run away from them! Last the quiet operation of the electric motor makes driving serene almost luxury car feeling in such a small car. Love it!

On the way to work I end up with about 20% battery life put on the way home I am at about 8%. So far car has 46K miles and is great because I save tons of cash versus gas. The only thing I do not like about the car is the circular gear console it is a little tight for me personally because I like to open my legs an stretch out from the long commutes I do everyday but beside that the car is GREAT!!! If you commute less than 50 miles I definitely recommend it plus great in tights spots when looking for parking.

When looking at previous vehicles, you just need to factor technology and bluetooth as upgrades needed.

They insist that it's just the way these cars are and they can't be returned to the original well functioning condition.

fiat,500e,2015,SJ Mathews, 10/20/2015,Just drive it,5,"Great commuter car, also a total blast to city drive.  Regenerative brakes are sweet and seem better than conventional, great acceleration, amazing that they make vehicles like this.  The only real downside I noted (aside from a limited range) is that going uphill really drains the batteries fast shortening the range.  That aside, it is really roomy in the front, the back clearly not popular with most.  You buy the EV that suits your needs- as we were looking at a commuter car, this was by far the best choice.

Update- three years later, no problems whatsoever.

fiat,500e,2015,tsaue, 06/19/2018,"nice commuter car, but not for a family",3,"If you're single and need something to get from A to B and happen to live in the city with access to a charging station either at home or near a chargepoint (where you have to pay) then this may be the car for you. I am a leasee of this and plan to drive it and give it back at the end of my 3 year stint, but I will have to say that you have to make compromises with this car. PROS/CONS as they come to me. Small, can park anywhere, stable up to about 80mph on highway, with the seats folded down you can fit a wide variety of items. If you have small kids, the back seat is great, if you are tall and an average sized adult you may have a lot of problems.  You also can not carry a golf club bag in the back if you have those seats occupied, maybe just one 3 people in the car and have one seat folded down. Charging at 32A which is the max rated for this car will take about 3.5 hours to charge to full which isn't bad. I use this car to travel back and forth to work at around 35mi away, you can barely make it back. If had to take detours you may be stretching it. I've also noticed that the battery is degrading after driving it hard for about 1 year. If you plan to drive this for longer than 5 years you may not be able to reach the rated 80mi on a single charge. Be prepared to stop or have that charging card ready. With all the short comings, I do enjoy my drive in the car, but with all the SUVs out there if god forbid you get into an accident, you may get out alive, cause there's not many crumple zones. I would highly recommend this car in city situations, but probably look towards volt or battery capable car to get you places. I think my next car will be a bolt because 200mi range is the sweet spot and calms my range anxiety. Cause you know, sometimes you just gotta go far. Many folks will need to have a backup gas car to go further places, but this may be a good interim car. I have no idea why but the insurance on this thing is SUPER expensive in CA, and parts are as well. Factor that in if you ever do get into an accident. Remember guys and gals, EVs are still new and in a few years time you're going to see a lot of choices. My recommendation is to get this car if you need to tie you over or just save up and bye our friend's Elon's brand. Thanks for reading.

fiat,500e,2015,Mikel, 01/15/2016,Quirky but Cute EV,5,"Lease terms are great when combined with rebates from California State and Central Valley.   Car is a hoot to drive: fast and responsive with great handling.   It also is cute and sophisticated looking.   Range is about 100 miles in the relatively flat Central Valley.   This car works great as a city commuter and carries our shopping purchases easily in the ""trunk"" and the extra space made by folding down the rear seats.  We are family of two ""empty nesters"" so although this car is an addition to our gas engine vehicles (bought to complement our newly installed solar array on the rooftop), it has become the favorite car to use.   Front seats are fine but rear seats are a bit cramped.  Controls are ""interesting,"" reflecting Italian design!!   The integrated info system in 2016 is a bit improvement over previous models.  In addition, the interior white/black color scheme is practical but classy.   We have had no problem in the city or on the highway.  Beware that this car does not allow Level 3 charging so expect to wait a bit longer for it to charge with Level 2 at public charing stations or a lot longer with the Level 1 charger that comes with the car.
"
fiat,500e,2015,Peter Fan, 10/23/2015,Great in the city but awful on highway,3,"PROS:  This car is really nimble in the city.  We live in San Francisco so parking is rarely a problem for this car.  This car is great at stop and go.  Often you can drive more than 100 miles in the city.  It has good handling and is fairly comfortable in the front seat.  CONS:  My worst complaint is the highway mileage.  If driving around 65 mph continuously don't expect the range to go beyond 60-70 miles.  Also, when you turn on AC you lose about 10 (estimated) miles in range so be careful.  Back seat is horrible in terms of space.  Trunk space is small but for a family of three it's big enough to hold our weekend groceries.  I like the interior design but the quality of material is really cheap so I don't think it's worth the price tag.  Everyone was laughing at the bright orange but this bright color is necessary because sometimes on the road people just don't see this compact car.  Reliability and safety are unknown at this point since I am not a pro.  Overall I'd recommend this car for short distance commuters.

fiat,500e,2015,FLJeff, 02/14/2017,Fiat 500e is really fun driving machine,5,"I purchased a used low mileage 2015 Fiat 500e a couple of months ago and was so impressed with how it handles that I purchased another for my sister.  These cars are a real steal on the used car market.  I live in South Florida where it is warm and flat and generally have been getting over 100 miles of range (EPA 87).  A Fiat 500 in general is not the most practical car but if you want something really fun to drive, this is it.   This car handles very similar to my former Mini Cooper but without the gas.  
UPDATE:  I'm still very happy with my Fiat 500e after more than two and half years of ownership.  Additionally, I have had excellent service from the Fiat Dealership (Arrigo) in West Palm Beach, when I have brought the car in for some minor items and software updates which were covered under Warranty.

fiat,500e,2015,Janis Froehlig, 04/09/2018,"Fun city car, and very manageable in the 'burbs",4,"Giving this a try as a ""mom car.""  The biggest PITA is trying to use standard driving directions.  Yes, highway mileage brings out what's probably the weakest point on the car. I've gotten my mileage estimate up to 110, but that's using my own hybrid of biking directions and knowing my way around both the roads and bike paths after having lived (relatively adventurously) in my city for 20 years.  There's also a driving style adaptation; I'm a chronic speeder, and one of the reasons I got this car was to self-impose restrictions on that.  Simply having the kWh display has been enlightening, to say the least.  (All cars should have some sort of energy-burn display).  If you drive a gas-powered car, be prepared for a change.  It's a good one, but a shift none the less.  ***  For reference, the trunk size with the seats down is about the same size as my old Forester with one huge exception: the angle of the back of the car.  I use my old trunk mat, but height in the back is so seriously lacking I'm thinking of removing the interior of the trunk panel just for the added couple inches.  *** 
 Visibility from inside the car is why I bought this.  It's not as good as older cars with nice big windows and narrow frames, but it's better than any of the other eCars I drove.  I've given up on being visible to other drivers, frankly, so... this one is great on agility, and the horn is loud enough while still having a polite staccato.  Traction in <4"" of snow, on ice, and in the rain is the best I've owned (but also the newest).  ***  It's really fun.  Charging stations are popping up in new places, I'm saving a car-payment's-worth in gas and oil changes, I can whip a u-turn right on the street and nab a really tiny parking space, and getting service simply having a newer car, even with Chrysler-FIAT, is a whole lot better than trying to fight for cred driving an older car.

What i was told by a fiat mechanic is that everybody at fiat knows the electric car is heavy and the tires they have don't last that long. If everybody knows, why wasn't i disclosed of this before the lease? If i had known i would need to replace my tires twice during the lease, i would have said no. then the headlights went out on year 2 and had to have those replaced.

fiat,500e,2016,Jon Sanserino, 10/01/2016,My Favorite car out of dozens!,5,"I bought this car because 95% of my driving is short range for shopping, post office, etc. when I am not traveling out of the country for business.  Also - the dealer and government incentives made the lease price so low, the car was essentially free - the lease is about the amount I paid for gas monthly.   I truly did not expect to fall in love with this little car!   It makes me smile every time I drive it.  It is amazingly quiet and solid, and very quick.  You really need to watch your speed.  It brakes very well, and also handles better than expected considering it has hundreds of pounds of batteries in the floor. Whenever someone new gets in, the first thing they say is ""Wow - it's nice!  And it's roomier inside than I expected!""  It is usually just me and a dog, or the two of us, but we have had 4 people in the car to go a short way to dinner, etc.   The fact that there is NO SOUND except the (excellent) radio turning on when you ""start"" it, still takes some getting used to.  The seats are surprisingly comfortable considering that they are so small and thin.  Totally adequate for the car.  The sound system is better than my Acura's.  The NAV is a simple TomTom system, but it works, and it has nearby charging stations pre-programmed in.  The Bluetooth works perfectly as does the climate control system.  This little car really is well equipped with everything except a backup camera, but the rear bumper is about 10"" behind the rear window so it isn't a  serious issue, and it has the parking sensors anyway.    Yes, there are a few little ergonomic issues about the car that frustrate me, and the steering requires real attention on the freeway,  but in general, for what it is intended for, this is what everyone should be driving around town.    I have owned around 50 cars, and this will be the one that will be hardest to let go of.   GREAT WORK FIAT!  And thanks to Fiat of Glendale for making the purchase so easy.

fiat,500e,2016,Califas, 07/08/2016,Zippy Electric Vehicle,5,"The 500e has a better response than the gas-powered version.  It handles better, has the best pickup and go, and is so fun to drive.  I wanted to lease an electric vehicle so I wouldn't have to pay for parking in my city's parking meters and garages (my city has an incentive to lease/purchase EVs) especially as I work downtown and must pay to park.  It's a dream to drive and park, and recharges when you break, so it becomes a game to get as much mileage from a charge as possible.  So far, I've had no problems with the car at all.  The lease is up the end of the year, and I've become spoiled with having an EV; it's wonderful not to pay for gas, oil, or smog check!  I hope to continue with either leasing or owning another EV.  At least in California, this is the way to go especially as the state has a pay back money incentive to own/lease an EV.

fiat,500e,2016,Jon Sweitzernoffenhold, 10/07/2016,Great-ish car.,4,"I like the way the car drives, but dislike a lot of the interior features.  First off, the performance is great and I've never had such a fun car to drive.  The acceleration sets you back in your seat and is instantaneous.   I don't mind the range as we kept our gas cars and 95% of our driving is local.  The charging has been fine with the standard 110 outlet and I don't see a need for the fast charger.  My 7 year old daughter fits in the rear seat without a problem, but I'm happy the lease will be up in a few years as we'll run out of room as she grows.  As for the bad....Headroom is awful.  I'm 6'3"" and basically have to put my head into the sunroof area to drive.  Backing out of a driveway is difficult as the rear visibility is very poor.  I'm happy for the sensors.  Storage inside the car is also horrible.  The glove box interior is flat so all your stuff comes out when you open the door.  The cupholders are too close together for even 2 medium drinks.  There's nowhere to put a cell phone.  I hate the radio.  There's a navigation warning that comes on for a while that prevents you from changing the channel...unless you take your eyes off the road and hit the ""accept"" button twice.  I don't need navigation as my cell phone does it better.  The Satellite Radio sounds compressed and worse than a cassette tape.  There's no CD player.  I love audio and honestly can't speak to the quality of the speakers since broadcast radio is the best quality thing I've listened to.  I hate that every statistic is listed in MPGe, but we fill the car in kilowatts.  I find MPGe to be a worthless number.  One cool feature about the car is the smartphone app that allows me to turn on the climate control before I get to the car.  It's just tough that it only turns on the last setting you had.  If I drove with the air off and the windows down, I have to remember to turn it back to automatic 68 degrees when I park if I want to use the app.    I also love/hate the App's function to show where the car is because it allows the person with whom you share the car with to spy on you.  I have nothing to hide, but it gets weird when the other person knows where you went out for lunch.  The regenerative braking is cool, but it doesn't seem to activate fully until the car is less than 90% charged.  i.e. It will regenerate up to -10kw, but after 89% battery remaining it will go up to -40kw regeneration.  It almost pays not to fully charge the car if you don't need the range.    There's also a weird spot between 5mph and 0 where the brakes engage differently and grip strongly into a forceful stop.   Overall I like the car as a car, but don't like the comfort features.  I'll miss it when the lease is up because it is such a unique experience.

fiat,500e,2016,AstroPreacher, 09/13/2019,Great Car - Stinkin' Good Deal!,5,"95% of my driving is local with just myself or one passenger, and the Fiat 500e is the perfect car for it!  We have another car in the family for road trips and multiple passengers.  The choice of a 500e has some drawbacks that you can see written into my opening praise.  It's got a range of 80-100 miles depending on speed and running the AC.  The back seat is a penalty box for anyone but small children.  If those drawbacks meet your needs, you will love this car!
My 500e has a tight premium feel.  The acceleration is awesome from a stop, although it gets a little weaker a highway speeds.  The combination of a car known for it's handling, and the positioning of the battery pack weight low and to the rear, make for amazing handling.  It corners better than my BMW 3 series.  The front seats are very comfortable and the ergonomics are pretty good.
A couple complaints:  The b pillars on this car are HUGE, making for poor visibility when changing lanes.  Make sure your mirrors are adjusted.  It does come with a very useful blind spot mirror, but it takes some getting used to.  The cup holders are awkwardly placed and not very useful.  The navigation system is a little clunky.  It does work, but google maps does it better on your phone.
A couple kudos:  The sound system is excellent (made by Alpine) and it plays well together with your phone.  The seats, though manual, are comfortable and highly adjustable.  The AC is very capable, although it does lower your range when it's on.  The 500e is a hoot to maneuver.  It fits through tiny gaps, parks easily, and will make a u-turn on any road.  
I have not bothered with a 240 volt charger.  It takes around 20 hours to charge on 120 volts (a normal US socket) with the charger that comes with the car.  I rarely run the battery all the way down, though, so it is pretty much always fully charged when I am ready to go to work.  I get an 80 mile range with the AC on and up to 100 miles in city driving without the AC.  This means I'm paying a little less than 3 cents per mile for electricity!  The 500e can use commercial 240 volt chargers and charge in about 4 hours.  It is not compatible with fast DC style chargers.
If the vast majority of your driving is local and one or two people, you will love the 500e!

fiat,500e,2016,Iwatobi, 06/20/2016,Great little gem for the money.,5,"Great little car for short distance commute and travel. Has plenty of space in the backseat even though trunk space is limited. Charging is easy but know that on standard 110V outlet it would take an entire day to charge up. 24V commercial chargers can do the same in 4 hours or you can install a 240V at home. Love the styling and it's a hoot to drive. Instant torque and no shifting makes the car feel like it has way more power than it does. No problem at all passing cars with easy and it handles very well. Slightly wobbly on highway with high wind. One of the best EV out there that drives handles and performance as good with any gasoline vehicle - 500E is better than any other 500 variant including the Abarth IMO.

I don't waist time at the pump or service centers for oil changes anymore. I have more time and patience because it fills up automatically when Im sleeping. I had a Mercedes Benz and will never get another gas car again. Plus now I'm saving precious Air for my Grand children!!!
"
fiat,500e,2016,Holly Johnson, 04/29/2016,WAY more expensive than you can even imagine!!,1,"DO NOT BUY THE FIAT 500e!!  There is a major design flaw that will cost you $2000 at least once, and likely $2000 / year.  This is NOT covered by the warranty.  Before buying one, take a look at the plug (where the gas cap would normally be).  It is very fragile plastic.  Now think that for 8 hours or more a day, this will be plugged into a charger with a handle slightly smaller than a gas pump handle.  Now think that if a small child bumps that even once, the plastic connector will snap.  That simple looking connector costs almost $2000 to replace.  It is part of a cable bundle that runs to the front of the car.  It takes 7 hours to replace (at least that's what they bill).  This will break!!  Beware before buying this car!!  Warranty will not cover it because they say it is the child's fault for bumping into it, not a car problem.

fiat,500e,2016,Judah, 04/02/2020,Love it,5,"Probably my favorite car I’ve ever owned, the range is pretty low, about 90 miles per charge on the highway, about 100 city driving only, but it’s soooo fun to drive and amazingly easy to park anywhere.

fiat,500e,2017,Chris Ginsburg, 09/15/2017,A real-world 500e review,3,"We just bought a used 2014 500e with 28k miles. Dealers are currently offering nice pricing as many 2014's are coming off-lease and being turned in. We paid $7500 + tax. which seems very cheap for car that cost $30K a few years ago. The limited market and relatively high production volume keep the current resale value low.  The car is blast to drive at lower speeds...  It's very quick and can zip in and out of traffic lightning fast. It feels light, nimble and could probably beat many expensive sports cars up to about 60mph. If you install a 240v fast-charger in your garage and only commute in the city or shorter distances -- the car is fantastic. If you have to travel over 25 miles on the freeway to work, I'm sorry to say the car is a joke. I would not recommend this car for commuting. The problem is that once you exceed 50mph, the battery charge diminishes shockingly fast, to the point where you may be scared you won't make it. It almost seems as though the car needs some kind of overdrive system because it uses tons of energy at 65mph, even with no throttle. In the city, it has regenerative braking to help recharge, but on the highway the motor eats battery power like crazy. The fully-charged ""96-mile range"" can only last about 40 miles at 65mph. If you commute, you'd better have a fast-charger at work or you may not make it home.

It commutes easily and it actually alot of fun to drive.  It is surprising quick and handles decent.
Instant heat and a/c ,cannot understate how well they work. Would recommend a wet weather tire.
I commute about 400 miles a week averaging 38mph & 139 mpge. "
fiat,500e,2017,M Saun, 08/21/2018,Already broken after one year!,2,"I've leased my 2-17 500e for one year (only 7k miles driven) and yesterday, it stopped taking a charge. Thankfully it is under warranty, and Fiat came to tow it to the dealership because it didn't have enough miles to get there. The dealership is 40 mins away, they're backed up and won't get to look at my car for another day, and they had no loaner car for me (although they did agree to cover my rental, if I made my way to Enterprise and dealt with that paperwork myself. Thanks for the terrific convenience, Fiat. If your car breaks on me while under warranty, you should probably consider making my experience very convenient.) On another note, we also have an electric BMW i3. I have driven it and the Fiat the same distance, and the BMW uses substantially less ""miles"" to go the same distance. I know it is said that the amount of miles used depends on how you drive it, but I find the Fiat to be far less reliable in terms of how far I can actually go, compared to the BMW (which is twice the price, so you get what you pay for!)  Also, the suspension bounces all over the road, and it breaks very abruptly. I have skidded out a few times accelerating on a hill.

The car was great to drive, had a few issues with charging initially, firmware upgrades, Auto Windows broke in between. when it got time to return the vehicle, the service was crappy. The closet dealership to return was 50 miles away, the car would not drive across highways to reach the dealership. The fiat roadside assistance would not cover the extra miles. Crappy Fiat management of lease options.
"
fiat,500e,2019,Electric Wizard, 07/12/2019,STAY ALERT intros very quick car.,4,"Jiggly ride but great fun to drive. The small wheels can get lost in large potholes that a big car could ignore. It doesn't wander. It doesn't skip down the road like a pickup truck on a dirt road. Nicely damped shocks on this car. Use back seat for duffles and fluffy packages, not people. Small back area OK for 4 grocery bags or two cases of wine. Center console lacks ability to change out cup holders for a little package or purse spot, cell phone holder, etc. Charges VERY fast on a level 2 charger. Mine charges to 114 miles, not just the advertised 86 miles. Nice paint but I wish the interior was not a black cave. Would prefer much brighter interior lighting. If the wheels are turned left or right and you pull out smartly, the car will jump left or right as this is a very intense electric. Quick steering response with a short wheelbase. Stay alert! You can easily drive this car way too fast. Above 50 mph or with windows open you deplete range much more quickly. It gives plenty of warning when you get to range of 15 miles or less and will identify the nearest charging point. You can drive it right to 1 mile remaining. At zero you must charge or tow it. Might be very handy as a camper's / mobile home accessory vehicle.  Not really a freeway car. You will feel safer on small roads and city streets but I am used to E-type Mercedes, not such little cars.  Mine is a lease conversion so only $109 per month, all in. That is a bargain. At the $34000 list price, I'd prefer a bigger Subaru Outback.  If you can remove the back seats this could be a great small delivery vehicle for lots of small, quick deliveries. Very easy entry and exit. Think Uber for pharma, small groceries, Amazon, etc. Your own cell phone is a far better navigator that the built-in one. Mine lacks Apple Play but otherwise links fine for phone audio function. Good display for tire pressures - be sure to keep them balanced and matched pressure. It keeps the garage clean and sweet-smelling too. Park two where one normal car could reside. Plug it in nightly and get used to never stopping at the petrol station. You will have the sensation that driving became free.  I don't mind running errands all over our small CA town as maneuvering and parking are very easy. It lacks modern warnings for cars in your blind spot. We don't have the back-up camera and find the parking sensor sounds way too early. There is no lane-hold or auto braking. Stay alert! This is not a Tesla. Ours does have a Tesla license plate which brings smiles. The car is so cute you may give it a name. Very basic controls for windows, mirrors, wipers. This is not a luxury car. I would not buy this for a young inexperienced driver, even though it is very easy to drive. The performance will lure a new driver to do silly things. On wet streets you can slide this easily with the brakes or spin the wheels when pulling out with too much power. The small tires do not have a lot of rubber on the road. There is not much maintenance to do other than keep it clean. Troubleshooting is via the standard plug but leave this for the dealer. "
fiat,500l,2014,Ron Lakes, 01/12/2016,She's a keeper!,5,"We've had our 500L for 2 years now, though have only put on 14K miles so far, and it's my wife's daily driver. Ours is the Trekking trim with the 6 speed Dual-Dry-Clutch Transmission. In response to an earlier recent review where the reviewer gave the car just 1 star, my experience couldn't be more different. 

To start off, I love the transmission, but I've adapted my driving habits to ensure its longevity. It is, after all, an automatically shifted manual- not a slush box.  What I'm talking about is, for example, to select the gear you want using the manual mode when in stop and go traffic, in particular when you're creeping along, and I always put it in neutral if I'm going to be stopped for any length of time. The reasons for driving the DDCT in this way are a bit technical, and maybe that's why dual clutch transmissions haven't caught on so well stateside. In any case, for 2015 all but the Pop trim come with the Aisin slush box if you opt for an auto transmission. 

 I've had no problem with the car rolling backwards on a slight incline when pulling away from a stop, and hill hold assist works well when on any incline greater than ""slight"".  The engine has proven to be plenty quick enough for merging with traffic etc. and frugal if you're easy on the gas. I've gotten upwards of 39 mpg when on back roads with no traffic, 34 or so on interstates, 25 to 27 in town (lots of cold starts routinely, so the economy suffers a bit for that).  

Some criticize the 500L for having too firm of a ride, but to me it is sublime, giving a very nice balance between ride and handling. The steering weights up nicely as you turn in, though I wish the turn-in response were a little sharper. It is very stable once into a corner, and it's fun to hustle it if you're in the mood, though the car is really excellent at just cruising on a sunny day, esp. if you've opted for the panoramic roof.

The 500L is reasonably quiet at highway speeds, and for our small family it's a great road trip car. The upright seating position gives us long term comfort,  and the expansive window area provides for an excellent view in all directions. We've found the front seats to be very comfortable with excellent adjustable lumbar support, though folks of longer inseam are more likely to have an issue with proper thigh support.  For 2015 the front seat bottom cushions have been lengthened to address this issue. How I have the driver's seat adjusted allows me full view of the instrument binnacle, though I can see where some might have issues with that- perhaps running a lower seat height and a bit more recline would do the trick for them. The parking brake handle works OK, though ergonomically it could be better. Infotainment is intuitive, simple, and has been trouble free for us. It synchs up with my 160gb ipod classic pretty quickly too. 

I've had Honda's, Acura's, VW's etc. and this has become my favorite. We decided to buy a MOPAR extended warranty just for peace of mind. Our's has been stone reliable save for the recalls for an airbag and a transmission re-flash.

Update: We've begun our 4th year of ownership of our 500L now, and I continue to enjoy driving it. So far we've accrued 22,780 miles and counting, so slightly less than 8,000 miles driven per year on average. It's given us zero problems, its economy continues to be excellent (about 27.4 mpg lifetime) considering that it's had a life of cold starts and short trips. The dual dry clutch transmission continues to perform flawlessly, no chattering that I've experienced when driving other makes' cars equiped with dual clutch transmissions. I continue to stick it in neutral at stops, manually select 1st gear when creeping along in traffic, etc. - these driving techniques are second nature to the point I don't really think about it, done primarily in the interest of minimizing clutch wear, however I personally
 enjoy the extra engagement in driving our 500L this way. The seats are awesome, and the interior has held up very well- looks almost new still, despite our Havanese's best efforts to scratch it up. And it is a solid car- no squeaks or rattles whatsoever. The suspension rides as new, which is to say, excellent. I would have to say this car has more European character, for better or for worse, than most euro imports, but there is nothing about it that is so different that you can't come to terms with it. It just feels a little special and different. If I were to down grade it relative to what is out there in the marketplace today, it would be for the tech, though that could be said of most vehicles of the 2014 model year. 

Spy reports show Fiat giving the 500L a face lift for the 2018 model year, and it should be available with most, if not all, of the tech you could want, including all the safety nannies- though that's just speculation on my part.

update August 2018- Our 500L is now my commuter car, averaging about 15K miles/yr. Fuel economy is now averaging 34.8 mpg.

REPLACED--2003 VW PASSAT wagon 1.8lT

ABOUT US—This is our SO CA 'family' car. We’ve owned mostly German cars (BMW & MB), my European husband was reluctant to buy it. This car cost half of the Subaru Outback wagon we intended on purchasing. We both have lived in Europe, so the look, size, & power of the car are not strange to us. We installed a THULE roof rack, a FIAT garage installed trailer-hitch for our Thule hitch-mounted bike rack. We are 5'8"" & 6'3"".

SHORT REVIEW—We are impressed & got a great deal. I can’t stress enough: FIND A GOOD FIAT STUDIO/DEALER/GARAGE, as this will directly affect your satisfaction.

INITIAL REVIEW--
The GOOD--Great bang for the buck. Fun to drive. A comfortable ride with DECENT SUSPENSION. PASSENGER SPACE comparable to our Passat with better headroom (friends 6’5” sat in the back, & another 6’6” in the front comfortably). Both front & rear seats are adjustable to customize needs and comfort. Intuitive layout & usage of COCKPIT & CONTROLS. We are enjoying the technology: SAT NAV, tech ports, 110v plug, dash trip computer, etc. Good use of SPACE (for a car this size). 
THE WEIRD-- Strange PARKING BRAKE. Stalled 1-2xs daily for first few weeks getting out of FIRST GEAR (different than other cars we've owned). Optical illusion of SIZE & SHAPE--Car is much roomier inside than appears.

6 MO REVIEW--
OVERALL—Still enjoying the ride & options. Car is now broken-in (& so are we), so we aren’t stalling out of first gear beyond normal occurrences. We’ve gotten used to the PARKING BRAKE. The GAS MILEAGE is decent (22-23/city & +26/hwy, with nearly 30mpg on long hwy trips. Seems to be improving.) The Trekking’s FABRIC SEATS (leather not available on this model) are more self-regulating than I would have assumed. After our hot SO CA summer and now our ‘cold’ weather, all is well. (I don’t miss having heated seats.) A 500L’s sunroof’s screen is perforated, so it will not fully shut out the sun even when closed, and roof racks are not compatible, so I am doubly glad we don’t have one.
CRITICAL—NO DEAL-BREAKERS. But…The DOORS lack a ‘stop’ mechanism, they don’t ‘fly’ open, but don’t open in a controlled manner when exiting your vehicle. The BLUETOOTH: good as an mp3 player, bad for talking on the phone. The MIC picks up too much sound from the dash vent & such. We had the ‘DEAD BATTERY issue’ (as noted by other owners) because of a SOFTWARE UPDATE that didn’t take (our FIAT studio’s garage checked-off as ‘done’), which was remedied by another FIAT garage. This other garage is a combo FIAT/JEEP, so they had the knowledge & know-how to install our TRAILER HITCH.
So,—FIND A GOOD FIAT STUDIO/DEALER. Many negative reviews stem from issues with a dealership rather than the brand. Hopefully FIAT can remedy this somehow, as they put out a decent product. We have heard about some transmission problems, but we since we have manual, we are hoping to avoid that.

fiat,500l,2014,jimofdenver500, 08/14/2013,Fiat 500L automatic,3,"I really like my new 500L but it does not like me. After 6 days, 350ml, it broke down in stop and go traffic on I-25 outside Denver. The twin clutch automatic heated up, smoked and therefore the system shut down. Had roadside assistance tow it back to the Fiat dealer. After setting for three days the car started okay and was drivable. The dealer could not find any problems, the engineer in Italy could not find any problem with the readout data. Their comment was that with the stop and go traffic the 500L twin clutch automatic acted ""normally"".
So what am I to do?? Not drive the car in USA stop and go traffic?!
Fiat USA is still working with me so hopefully there will be a positive outcome."
fiat,500l,2014,sparkin5280, 02/25/2015,Best Value in this segment by far,4,"Like someone else said, this is one of the most underrated small cars on the market today.  It's well documented that Americans don't like wagons or minivans for that matter.  Well apparently neither do most auto journalists because this car is lambasted in every pupublication.  Just go drive one for yourself, these are TONS of fun. In Colorado here at this elevation Turbos and their forced induction rule the land.  Maybe in Texas at sea level this car seems pokey, but in this thin air this 1.4 direct inject turbo runs hard and is a blast to drive. I upgraded from a Mini Clubman and LOVE the fact I can fit 3 car seats wide.  To be fair I have the 6 speed manual so no automatic problems here."
fiat,500l,2014,bobfl3, 07/20/2013,Second Fiat,5,"I loved my 2012 500c but found myself needing something a little larger.
I traded in the cabrio for the new 500L and am very pleased with it so far.
I've only driven 500 miles on the new one, so time will tell if it is as reliable as the little 500 was.
I'm very happy with the Dual Dry Clutch Automatic.
It is fuel efficient and has the pick up I need for merging into heavy traffic on the highway.
Taller people fit well in the car, even with the sunroof.
The car has an excellent ride quality and everything works as it should.
It is comfortable, has great visibility, plus it's fun to drive."

Nice design. comfortable, smooth ride. Fantastic pick up with the 6 spd. Trekking trim is really great.
plenty of storage.
The front side windshield windows make for great visibility.

The only cons are the armrest is in the way of the hand brake.
But it does fold up out of the way.
And the driver side wiper does not lift up for easy window cleaning and snow clearing.
You have to get the wipers in the ""up"" position and turn off the car so the wiper stays ""up"". Then you can lift it up off the window.
That's an oddity."
fiat,500l,2014,scrappy60, 03/29/2014,Glad I Waited for Six Months to Review,4,"I bought a Fiat 500L Trekking in September 2013. To be honest, it took me quite awhile to get used to its rather quirky transmission -- and I have a manual!! The issue was the six gears and the need for a quick shift between first and second. But now that I have gotten used to how and when to shift, I am very happy with my purchase.

This vehicle has all the features of the pricier Honda CRV at about 5K less -- and it looks better and handles better on the road. Last month I took it on a 800 miles road trip and it was so enjoyable to drive.

The gas mileage is also far better than I expected -- I am getting over 29 miles per gallon (combined highway/city)."
fiat,500l,2014,clj1959, 08/31/2014,Surprised at how much I like this car,4,"I downsized to a 500L Easy with a sunroof and automatic from a VW Tiguan.
At first I thought ""what have I done?"" but after a couple of months, and now that I'm accustomed to the quirky transmission, I totally love this car.
It's very peppy and incredibly easy to maneuver.
I have a 25 mile freeway commute and the 500L handles it with aplomb, and the excellent visibility is a big plus when changing lanes.
Another big plus is how unique it is.
I'm very happy."
fiat,500l,2014,Joseph Fiamoncini, 04/05/2016,great little/big car,4,"Easy to park due to small size yet very roomy inside, peppy engine when paired with the manual transmission, good cargo space, fold down rear seats are not flat unless you use the cover from the storage area in the raised slot to better align the floor of the storage area with the folded seats, stadium style rear seats so that you can easily converse with rear passengers and they can see the road and front seat rider, handles well in corners, can be choppy on poor road surfaces, generally get 28-30 MPG on mixed city/highway driving, both I and my wife own 500L trekkings which together have a combined mileage of 59,000 miles, so far no breakdowns at all and only one recall for airbags, we also opted for the lifetime warranties on both cars, it does have some features that may have led early buyers to think it has gremlins, when making turns the fog light on that side turns on which is great in the dark on sharp turns as it lights up the shoulder of the road for you, when we first bought the car we thought that was a electrical problem but it turns put the dealer had only just learned that it was a feature (which can be disabled from the touch screen controls), the dealer had actually been replacing units in an effort to fix what was not a problem, the GPS needs updated maps which we were told was due to the maps themselves that were being supplied for the system this is not really a major problem for the vast majority of the time the maps have been dead on, the biggest problem has been the owners manual itself, the index was compiled for a different manual entirely as the referenced page numbers don't actually take you to the information that you are trying to look up, also the information in the manual is very weak in useful content, the brakes can be grabby and take experience with the vehicle to learn how to modulate them (they still catch me off guard once in a while) but when needed they seem to stop the car quickly and in a relatively short distance, the air conditioning works well but does affect the gas mileage, the car did get good IIHS crash ratings which was a factor in our decision to purchase them, all in all a competent and reliable vehicle thus far, my other car is a 2007 mazdaspeed 3 so I know about and use quick cars that can handle and brake well; @@@@@@@@ 4/29/2017,,update- we are over 90,000 miles between the two cars, no issues, premium gas will get a little more pep, might be useful here in Florida with heavy air conditioner use but I don't bother, however this does not equate to an increase in gas mileage, don't be afraid to drop down multiple gears on the stick shift to get moving quickly as the top 3 gears are all overdrive ratios, initial pullout needs some revs, wonder if a lighter fly wheel would allow a quicker spin up on the first 1500 RPM's, that is getting a little more technical, Hey, FIAT engineers are you listening.  Gas mileage remains around 28,  a majority of in town stop and go will drop that to 23-24 MPG.  Car does need several thousand miles of break in to get best acceleration(noticeable difference),  hmm sounds like a lot of older American iron block cars.

fiat,500l,2014,roiscuba, 10/20/2014,On our 2nd 500L and my 5th FIAT total,4,"This has got to be one of the most underrated cars on the market today.  When you strip away the funky exterior (to American tastes) it's a great car, especially in a market segment that has essentially been abandoned.

We bought our 1st 500L (Trekking w/manual trans) back in February.  Loved the car.  Only had minor annoyances (armrest and hand brake operation) that we would have found in any car.  Loved it for day to day driving, loved it on the freeway.  Used it to haul our 2 Great Danes around with us.

When my wife wrecked the car and the insurance company totaled it, we immediately went to another 500L (fully loaded Lounge) without hesitation, because my wife was not hurt at all."
fiat,500l,2014,Jeremy Stewart, 01/29/2016,"Overall ok, now that we learned more",3,"Overall this has been a decent car for us.  We've taken a number of long-ish trips (3-8 hours in the car), and we've never had an issue.  It's a comfortable ride (I'm 5'10, my wife 5'4 and we both fit comfortably in front or in back. 

We now have a son who is almost 1 and he's spent his entire life thus far riding in this car.  With the car seat in the middle, it's a little cramped in the back, but nothing bad. 

The trunk doesn't fit the jogger stroller very well, well just enough for the stroller and nothing else.  It will fit in the front seat (upside down), but it makes reaching the shifter a bit awkward.  We really should have gotten a larger car, but my wife LOVED the unique look of the car and the fact that you just don't see many of them around.

The Navigation is acceptable, though I wish it had real time traffic updates and I wish the head unit had CarPlay (by Apple) support, it would make things noticeably easier for us, but after a few software updates the bluetooth connects to Siri and now we don't have the terrible default voice recognition software.  Plugging your iPhone into the USB port gets you a few different experiences, but the bluetooth pairing has been pretty good now.

The only thing I haven't liked about the car is the transmission, and probably more about the lack of education about it.  When we bought the car, we were told about the different transmission, but never how it meant we had to treat the car differently than any other automatic.  A few months after buying the car, a drive through Starbucks opened up near our house to which my wife has become a regular at.  Sometimes she's had to wait in line quite a while and she'd sit in drive with her foot on the brake.  After a few minutes she'd notice a smell. It smelled like burning coolant or something sweet like that.  She tried to figure out the cause, but couldn't.  Every time we took it to dealer they could never replicate it.  Another time she actually had some smoke coming out from under her car. 

After some serious google-fu, I was able to track it down to the fact we should put the car in neutral when at a stop for ""a while"".  There's no documentation that says what ""a while"" is or anything, so now so long as it's not a stop sign we put it into neutral (stop light, drive through, or stop & go traffic).  We wish the dealer was more forth coming with this information when buying the car, in fact my wife may have actually changed her mind on the car with that information at hand, but all said she loves the car, just wishes it was a LITTLE bit bigger in the trunk.

Update: 2/4/2017 - we've added another child to our lives and this makes the car feel even smaller. A double stroller will fit in the trunk but it takes some Tetris skills. There's no fitting an adult in the back with the 2 car seats. Maybe a super thin adult. When it comes down to it, when we are done with the payments this car will go to me and my wife will get a larger car to drive the kids around in. We should have gotten a larger car from day 1 unfortunately. If this car were larger it would be great. 
 
Repair wise it's been pretty trouble free, which is good considering our local dealer stopped servicing FIATs and we now have to go 30 miles to get dealer warranties.

Update 2/6/2018 - December 2017 the car had transmission issues with a lack of power. Could force it into lower gears via manual selection and go but it was tough moving from a stop. Took it to the local dealer (who never stopped servicing fiats even though they told me they were going to) and had them look at it. They thought it was one thing. 2 weeks later they still had it and it wasn’t fixed so they had to replace the entire transmission. That fixed it. But a new transmission at 30k miles is ridiculous. It was outside the warranty but we had our extended warranty which covers it for 10yrs or 100k miles, so out
 of pocket for us was $100. Would have been roughly $10k without the warranty according to the service rep.
 
I can’t with good conscience recommend this car. I know with the 2014 or 2015 model they redesigned the transmission (pretty much standard instead of some double dry clutch monstrosity), and maybe that will improve the reliability of the car for those models.

fiat,500l,2014,Bruce Sal, 02/03/2016,Still a good choice after 56000 miles.,4,"I have put 45000 miles on my 500L Trekking in 27 months. It is driven 3-5 days a week to work 24 miles one way. I have made numerous trips of 300 to 450 miles one way. I find the front seats become uncomfortable only on the longest trips. I track my MPG since new and average 30.3 MPG. My best is 39.8. I have the auto transmission and I did have to get used to it. It does not always shift smoothly. I had a problem with the engine check light due to a fuel vac leak. The leak was never found and the problem stopped over a year and a half ago. I love the dashboard. I like a simple layout and feel the FIAT gives it to me. The view from the drivers seat is beyond compare. Cargo room is great. I can carry 2x4x8 boards in the car. It has been a great little car. The TECH package was the selling point for me. The backup camera is awesome.

fiat,500l,2014,Ron Margheim, 02/25/2016,Pope Mobile is great car!,5,"I bought this new in March of 2015. Advertised $8000 off MSRP. Great buy.  The turbo kicks in @ 3000 rpm's and it becomes a rocket! Easy access, massive headroom.  I have 10,000 miles and no problems.  I personally love the European Automatic Transmission (DCA). Feels like a manual without the clutch, Most new 2016 models at the dealers have an American Automatic. Guess some people didn't like the DCA. Plenty of trunk space, Always get great mileage.

fiat,500l,2014,Scott in DFW, 06/22/2016,Over 20K on a 2014 Fiat 500L Trekking,4,"It's a shame this car has gotten such bad press. I know some have had bad experiences, but I've read about others who have had wonderful experiences with this car. You can almost park this car almost anywhere -- I believe it's length is a few inches shorter than a Toyota Corolla -- yet it has such room inside for passengers and cargo. It's not a sports car, but it handles well enough and rides comfortably on all but the roughest or bumpiest roads. As of this writing, I have had no issues at all; just normal maintenance. The bad press has probably affected sales, so look carefully for a good deal if you're shopping for one.

The check engine lights and transmission lights go on. The whole car has lost power leaving me with no power steering brakes flying down the HWY 70 mph. The car is unsafe. Fiat acts like they never heard of this issue but I have found other people on forums that have had the same so apparently its an issue. I don't feel safe in the car and they are refusing to help me.

Our Sport had 8,500 miles with zero problems.


We now have 2500 miles on the L.
Very well built.
Both cars were ordered with the manual transmission which I think is a better option.
The negative reviews all seem to be on cars with the auto/dual clutch trans.

Combined mileage is 27.3-mostly around town.
33 mpg on highway."
fiat,500l,2014,marbitman, 10/02/2014,Update after 5 years of driving.,5,"I bought a 500L Easy with automated manual transmission from Fiat of Austin in October, 2013. When my wife wanted to purchase the Blue Chiaro color, and the dealer did not have it in stock, or on order, Lisa C., the manager, immediately got on the case, searched the orders coming into the US, and swapped inventory with a regional dealer, getting the color that we wanted. Delivery was smooth, and we (the car and I) got acquainted.
This car is beautifully styled, in and out, is well built, and behaves normally in most unextreme conditions.  It is not perfect....I find the brakes to be a bit ""touchy"", but they perform well.
I find the transmission quirky, but it performs well. 
Update: after 2 years of use this car remains comfortable, reliable, and versatile; excellent on long trips with one passenger and luggage. My other vehicle is a Mazda RX-8, so that I am well versed in the art of performance.
Update : The Fiat continues to perform like a champ.  I really like the dual clutch transmission.

Update:: traded in the 500L for an Alfa Giulia.  Just got back from Rome, where 4 of us taxied all over the city. 500L is used as a taxi, with diesel engine,and we had  comparo rides in Mercedes, Kia , Renault, Peugeut, etc.  The Fiat not only held its own, but was the most comfortable of the bunch.

fiat,500l,2014,jabird101, 02/17/2014,Fantastic value and just plain fun to drive,4,"I purchased my 500L in early July 2013.
When I tried to insure it, Progressive had no rate for this vehicle.
This is how early I got in on the 500L.
After 7 months I am more than pleased with the performance, quality, economy and just plain fun.
There have been reports of transmissions issues, and while there were some that had issues, this was caused by a faulty version of the controller software, and has since been corrected.
Those affected became a very vocal group of three or four people who have plastered false info every where they can.
This is proven by the 25,000 plus units with the DDCT, the tens of thousands of Dodge Dart DDCT units and the 100,000+ good units world wide."
fiat,500l,2014,redgoldkc, 09/13/2013,First Fiat,4,"This is a great looking small car with a surprising amount of interior room.
I love the emerald green color that I selected.
It is recommended to use premium gas and the engine does seem to run smoother and more responsive with premium gas.
I am not sold on this ""automated manual"" transmission.
It feels somewhat unstable and it is difficult to shift from park to reverse when parked on hill with the front of the car higher than the rear.
The gas mileage is subpar for a small front wheel drive car.
I have averaged 25mpg in primarily city driving.
Overall, this car has it perks and drawbacks.
As for competitors: Soul and Juke were too much of a kid car. Encore cramped and Mini CM pricey"

fiat,500l,2014,lisanomni, 09/07/2013,Broke Down Already!!,2,"I bought my Fiat 500L about 3 weeks ago.
I was on my way to work, when it started shaking and the transmission light came on.
I had to wait for Fiat to open and the car had to be towed in.
This Maxwell Supercenter has no clue how to repair the car and I have been without it for a week.
The manager, Jack M., has been Very difficult and even though I got a call today, after 7 days, I do not feel comfortable and safe in My Fiat.
I plan to return it.
The GM (Lisa C.) here at Austin Fiat has no concern and when my attorney confronts her with the Lemon Law and demands a refund, maybe she will sing a different tune?
I have been stunned at the poor service I have received!"
fiat,500l,2014,William Pilcher, 12/29/2015,Excited to Frustrated/Alarmed,1,"Excited to buy, loved having a fiat but should have done more homework but when we bought last year there was not this much about the cars. Purchased it as a commuter/local use. Love the room inside, lots of head room, wide so you are not rubbing you elbows and the back seat is very roomy as mentioned in other reviews.
Cons:1. on a slight incline when you take your foot off of the brake the clutch takes about 2 seconds to engage, so you roll back and there is a slight pause before power goes to the wheels. Nearly got T Boned the first time, 2. going uphill the power steering looses power so you have to exert more muscle to turn the wheel, then in the middle of the curve the power returns and if you are not ready you end up in the oncoming lane, 3. As mentioned in earlier reviews the brake are not consistent, one time quick and grabby the next there is pedal drop before a smooth application, 4. The low beam headlights do not illuminate nearly far enough, I asked the dealer to dial them higher and he told me they were as high as they would mechanically go. I jus keep them on high beam all of the time and almost nobody notices, If you live in the city you would never notice but if you are driving around back roads or not spending all of your time on interstates then you will feel blind, 5. As mentioned earlier there are few dealers in the Dodge/Chrysler organization that have a trained Fiat mechanics so you have to go to the Fist dealer for anything beyond oil change despite the dealers claim that you can get service at any Dodge/Chrysler service shop, 6. The front seats are not comfortable for a drive longer than 20 minutes, there do not go back far enough for me to have my legs (5'10""), 7. The steering wheel tilts but only slightly so that if you tilt it up it stops and blocks part of the display, They give you plenty of head room but the car does not accommodate persons over 5' 5"" or so, we tested with friends, 9. we have had the car for just over a year and I was thinking about trading it in for another Dodge/Chrysler product and the dealer appraised the car at $8,000 and the salesman informed me that it was one of the worst depreciating cars in the USA and he had about 15 used Fiats. I am not 18 and understand car depreciate. I am also old enough over 45 to have driven many cars and know the difference between not liking the feel of handling of a car and not feeling safe driving a car. At first I thought I just needed to get used to it but over time it just gets worst and having to adjust my driving to keep from getting into a dangerous situation is not healthy.
I made a big mistake purchasing this car for a number of reasons. I plan to trade it in as soon as I can research and purchase a replacement."
fiat,500l,2014,mahmabear, 01/24/2014,NEVER BUY FIAT!!,2,"I got the car, drove it home, very next day it didn't start.
Took it to the shop, it said, ""It's too cold for it here"" (Northern Indiana)...Brought it back home, drove it for three days (300 miles) with starting issues...then it totally broke down.
Wouldn't start, stereo was cutting out and blowers on the heater/air conditioner stopped working.
Call for Fiat Roadside assistance, three times a day for 6!!!!! days until they finally came to get it.
Towed it to the shop where it has sat for two weeks.
I am getting the run around completely."

We have 8832 kilometers on our car and a rattle/knock has started in the front end when going over small or large bumps. When we bought the car Chrysler said we could use any Chrysler dealer to service/warranty work on our car and when we called City Chrysler Corner Brook NL they said no we do not service Fiat. Called Fiat Canada and they told us we have to drive to the nearest Fiat dealer, 10 hours away in St. John's NL. Do your homework if you are planning on buying a Fiat, ensure you have a dealer close by and get everything in writing. We will be selling our Fiat and will make sure no one in Western NL buys a Fiat. "
fiat,500l,2014,Jason Moore, 12/15/2015,"Bought a 2014 ""New"" Treeking for $14K",5,"Review 2014 FIAT 500L Trekking w/ 6 Spd manual white - no options besides 6.5"" Navigation

Pros: 

1.  Paid $14k for a new car with 100 miles, full warranty (4 yrs/50 mi).  10/10)

2.  Navigation, bluetooth, mp3 (via USB and/or SD card), andUconnect all work well. (9/10)

3.  Comfort - very roomy.  Took my wife, daughter (5yr. w/ car seat), and in-laws to and their luggage to the airport - 10/10.

4.  Manuverability/drivability - 1) the lighest clutch I've ever experienced.  2) short turning radius - makes parking and U-turns very easy.  3) Sturdy - feels like you are driving a Town & Country minivan (about the same ride height)  4) 1st gear is weird, but 3rd gear is when the torque shows up.  5)  drives well in the snow.  Was able to get up/over ice/snow covered hills that I used to get stuck on with old car.  6) at 700 miles, I get 24.5 MPG city, 34.5 highway.  The highest highway MPG was 37.0 (5 peo people plus luggage - going to the airport).  I paid $15 to fill my tank (regular, even though premium is recommended) a few days ago.  Small tank, decent range. 7) Power steering is like theold luxury cars from the 70's & 80's - light & easy.

5.  Easter eggs - 1)  the first day I got it, the arm rest was in the way of my shifting.  You can lower it by pulling on the feont latch and pushing it down (at an angle) perfect for resting your arm and shifting.  2)  You can keep your headlights switched to ""on"" all the time - basicall like auto headlights.  3)  When you turn your wheel (right or left) the fog lights come on to light the path.  4)  the fog lights are very bright.  5)  You can set a max spedd limit to get a reminder of when you go over a certain speed (I set mine to 75).  You can also set the Navigation to aler t you when you are druving over the posted speed limit.

5.  In reverse, the rear windshield wiper automatically truns on.

6.  If you make a panic stop - hit the brake hard, the hazard lights will automatically flach - alerting drivers behind you.


Cons

1)  There are some rattles when driving over rough roads.  The conversation mirror makes noise if you forget to stow it.

2) I was on the highway, and the fasten seatbelt buzzer went off.  I un-fastened and re-fastened my bektm but it cintinued to chime.  It only stopped when I buckled the (empty) frint passenger seat.  It hasn't happened since.  

3)  one morning, I noticed that the exterior lights were on (overnight?), car was slow to start/crank over, but still started.  Will turn the lights one/off manually.


Regrets:  None - At first I wanted Beats and the moonroof, and the black roof (with the rest of the car white), but it was beyond the scope of my budget, and would ultimately just make the car colder/hotter/louder. Looked at the 2015 Urbanna - but didn't want to pay more.  I could see black wheels getting old/boring after a few years.  I like tge styling and floating roof design w/ Trekking body cladding.


Overall 9/10 - My parents alwats drover cars different than everyone else, and now so do I.

fiat,500l,2014,darthmoll21, 01/13/2015,Worst mistake of my life,2,"I traded in a reliable Rav4 for this piece of crap. For the first few months, the car worked well, aside from a few recall issues. After I'd had it for 6 months, the problems really started to surface. The check engine light kept coming on and I was taking the car to the shop nearly every other week. The transmission completely locked up at one point and I had to turn the car on and off several times before it unlocked. The transmission also began to jerk much more (yes it's quirky but this is NOT a feature) while accelerating and decelerating, making stop and go traffic particularly dangerous. I'm currently pursuing lemon law on this car so I can get rid of it!

Breaks inconsistent, lastly panel board goes crazy, with engine light, and others go off I call the dealership to take it in, I setup an appointment to have it diagnosed, they keep it for a week to advise me that the transmission is gone at 70,000 miles. I challenged that since I drove it there. I had researched recalls on this model, and was told that all the recalls where completed, I asked where and when and was told that the place it was originally done is no longer in business, sketchy with Fiat INC. they avoided me with follow up which made it even more frustrating. I highly recommend YOU to stay away from looking at this disaster of a car, the so called Corporate side of them is in complete denial, I'm now stuck with a car, that I serviced & maintained when due, to have this extra expense of a new trans that they priced at $5,400 to repair, is disheartening!!!

I say can because the vents and cheap interior plastic vibrate and rattle if not on a freshly paved road.
Also, I hate to turn off the bass on the Beat audio because it made the plastic on the door rattle.

The roads around here are very beat up yet the L remains solid and rattle free. Our family of 5 fits great and any extra luggage goes on the roof. The L is a great buy.

The car loses power when accelerating leaving the driver with no ability to move the car out of busy intersections, or the ability to go at all from stops. Random occurrences so problem is hard to replicate, have had the service engine light come on - even have pictures of it on - still to be told that the computer never shows or records a problem so there fore they can do nothing. I have called and open a ""case"" with FCA and all I am told again and again is sorry until I can show and have a service tech with me when it happens they can't do anything.

fiat,500l,2014,valibertarian, 02/09/2014,Dangerous Vehicle -- Do not consider buying,2,"I purchased a 500L Trekking for my wife three weeks ago.
After the first week, we drove down the road and the transmission was locked in 2nd gear.
It would not shift up or down -- even with auto stick.

We had to pull over and shut the car off -- then it would not restart because it was locked in second gear.
We were stranded on the side of the road.

We eventually made it to the dealership and they gave us a 500L loaner -- the next day the same thing happened with it!

Check the Fiat 500L forums and you'll find that this is a known and common issue.
There are also multiple complaints with the NHTSA.

After 28 days (just before the Lemon Law kicked in) the car was returned with a supposed flash update to the transmission but the problems continued.

On top of that, the car would not start in cold weather.

Six months into ownership, the car was totaled with my pregnant wife and one-year old daughter on the car.  Thankfully the airbags deployed (at least they worked unlike the rest of the car).

I really enjoy the dual clutch transmission gives me the ""manually feel"" but I do not wear out my left knee in city traffic.
The adjustability of steering column up/down in/out is excellent.

The vehicle is mainly driven in the city we have done some highway driving one 3 hour trip and the ride was very comfortable.

With the rear seats down I was able to get a 55 inch flat screen TV in the box with about 1'' to spare with length and width in to the 500L.

The 500L has the Daytime running lights which I have enabled.

The UConnect works well with my iPhone.

We just returned car at lease and of 39 months. No issues with car, just recalls and normal maintenance. 
We still completely enjoy the vehicle.

The primary reason for returning the vehicle was the local Fiat Studio closed and the next closet Studio is to far away. Otherwise we would have bought out the lease.

My first thought was the transmission. I was able to get it to the dealer on its own by not driving hard. Turned out to be a turbo issue. The dealer said a clip holding on the waste gate was missing. Ok so replace the clip? Not the case you cannot order just the clip according to the dealer! the turbo is $900.00 plus 5-6 hrs. installation. Not a problem I have a third party warranty and I am under the 100k by just 1600 miles! Feeling good until the company that provides the warranty said this is not covers because you lost the clip. According to them it is not the turbo that is bad it is the fact that you lost the clip. Like I removed it! After going back and forth with them they agreed to sent out an adjuster to evaluate. I will add to this based on the final result. Bottom line I really enjoy the car, it has been reliable everyone that gets in it is impressed with the room and ride. 6-28-19 car performing well. Time for front struts and going on my 3 rd set of front brakes. Overall very little issues with this car.

I read up on the dual auto clutch from the information Fiat provided and have no complaints.  A well equipped car that is reliable and performs.  I also purchased the lifetime extended warranty for $2,500 although I read you could get it as low as $2,295."

I love the style, the roominess, the visibility and how much fun it is to drive.  It took a bit to get used to the transmission (manual, a little odd in first gear), but now it is great.  It did have a recall to repair a computer issue causing the battery to die when parked in the cold for more than 48 hours with no start, but hopefully that is resolved.  Some minor electrical things are a little quirky, but no big deal.  I had my VW golf prior to this for 15 years with no major issues (it had early recalls for an oxygen sensor chip so was not perfect), so reliability is my only real concern with the Fiat."

fiat,500l,2015,Gilberto Marcha, 04/08/2016,Disagree with the experts. This car is underrated!,5,"This is the 11th new car I have purchased and this is one of the most enjoyable. My 2015 500L is a pleasure to drive. This vehicle has received  more than a few negative professional reviews  but I strongly disagree. Yes the center armrest is narrow but it is functional. I do not mind the emergency brake handle location. The car provides a great view of the road and the seating position is excellent. The ride is tuned to a good level in my opinion. I live in Chicago and this car has proven to be easy to park in tight city street spaces while providing excellent interior volume. Great cargo space for those larger purchases. Highway performance is also good, I have averaged 33 mpg.  My children love this car and prefer to ride in it vs our Ford Taurus. 
I was in the market for a Chrysler 200 but when I could not find one equipped to my liking I took a chance on test driving the 500L and never looked back. 
Yes I was concerned with the professional ratings and reviews but my experience has been all positive. I have not experienced  the brake fade some reviewers did.
My car came with the Beats audio system and I frequently have too adjust the base level down as it is tuned too a level way too high.

The performance of the multi-air turbo is phenomenal and unexpected. For its size, the 500L is nimble and handles more like a sports car than the Fiat self-described ""Urban Utility Vehicle."" I highly recommend the Trekking version of this vehicle. It is a better designed model than the others offered and more rugged in appearance. "
fiat,500l,2015,Richard, 05/02/2016,Fun and Functional,5,"Having owned a fiat 128 Sedan, Fiat 128 3P, Fiat Bravo, and Fiat Spyder 2000 and loved them all I thought I would give Fiat another try since my wife has had a trouble free 500 Sport since 2012 with no problems.

I traded in my luxury ride Buick Century for a 500L and I am in love with it. It has plenty enough power to get you on the interstate and cruise at the traditional 5 mph above the speed limit, as well as, get you in and out of tight spots. I especially love the option of running the gears yourself with the optional 6 speed automatic.

It has lots of room both front and back and handles like a European Car should handle. It cuts and turns quickly and holds the road beautifully. All of that while maintaining a comfortable ride.

I noticed that it stands just a few inches short of my 2003 Chevy Venture van.

The appearance means a lot to me also, as it is highly unique and does not have the cookie cutter design that most cars have.

In general, it looks great, is functional, roomy, powerful enough and fun to drive.

fiat,500l,2015,Mark, 11/10/2015,I LOVE my 2015 Fiat 500L Trekking 6-speed automati,5,"I had a 2012 500 Sport and it was time for something bigger, I love the look of the 500X and had to take one for a test drive. I picked a Black 500X Trekking AWD, I liked the comfortable ride and was impressed with the 9 speed transmission. While talking about the numbers with my sales person, I could not take my eyes of this 2015 Rosso Perla colored 500L Trekking that was on the show room floor. 

After a few days I still could not get that car out of my mind, so I went back and test drove that 500L and I loved the cavernous feel on the inside, but it isn't enormous outside (love the cargo area and fold down back seats); it sips gas, has really good visibility, comfortable front seats and a smooth drive. The AISIN Heavy Duty 6 speed automatic shifts great and responds well when I need to down shift for passing or merging onto the highway.

So for me I had to have the 500L Trekking, a week after I got it we took it on our family vacation. And it was very comfortable on that long 4 hour road trip to Todd PA. It got around 34 mpg (all highway driving) and on my normal day to day driving I average around 30 combined.

I do love this car. I've had no problems whatsoever with it (it's still very new, only 1850 miles, so I'll keep my fingers crossed).

It's weird, cute, bug-eyed looking and these are all positives to me. I have absolutely no regrets having moved into a car that performs the same functions of getting me around, but gives me so much more enjoyment than the average same-old same-old car everyone else has.

Family, friends and coworkers always ask me ""Why another Fiat?"" aMy response is always the same, go test drive one for yourself and you will see why I love them. 

Not every poor review about the Fiat brand is true; you can't believe everything you read.

After a year of ownership, the Fiat 500l  Trekking is one of the best vehicles I have owned. Unlike other reviews I have not had any problems with the 500l. The only time it has seen the service center is for its routine maintenance. 

So let me say it again, not every poor review about the Fiat brand is true; you can't believe everything you read.

fiat,500l,2015,Carl M., 10/15/2015,Sleeper of a deal...,5,"WHY is this car not more popular?  I mean, I know it looks ""different"", but that's a good thing in the endless sea of ""blah"" crossovers and SUV's.  Had to give up my beloved VW GTI because we're ""of a certain age"" and getting in/out of a vehicle is now a major factor for us.  This thing is a hoot. I don't understand any of the reviews that state the car has a rough ride.  We rented a Cadillac ATS a while back, and this cars ride is, unbelievably, just as good.  We find the engine plenty peppy (remember, I traded in my GTI for this), the transmission is just fine, and the steering is nice and light for dodging other cars in parking lots.  I've got 1000 miles on it as of this review, and no problems.  The interior of this car is GI-MON-GOUS.  Huge headroom, legroom, and space in all directions.   I wish more people would test drive these things;  Once you drive one, you'll buy it.   Very very European driving experience.  You'll love it.

fiat,500l,2015,Vessela Raskov, 11/15/2015,STILL THE BEST,5,"STILL THE BEST.
I would never know why the ""official"" reviews were/are so negative. It's an ongoing puzzle because
(besides a serpentine belt's part which came loose and was misdiagnosed at Fiat service at year 2, and the car gave
plenty of warnings) this car has been a star.
Equally so in upstate NY (currently -2F) and in the city (NYC) some 200 miles south. It packs plenty of power, very responsive,
the turbo is fantastic and, being only front wheel drive, I see no problems driving on the icy roads outside.
Always starts (no need for engine heater) and I have seen some serious winters here; car is parked outside, no garage.
Flawless electronics, stunning design inside and out. One change of tires - after 40k miles ! Steady 27 MPG combined 
highway/dense city traffic.

I think the ""reviewers"" are stagnant in their confined positioning to slave on big brands and their boxy, boring designs and most of all, unimaginative, humor-less "" seriousness"" that prevents them to see how very cool and functional Fiat 500L is ! 

My car is still a head-turner ! Too bad Fiat won't bring to the US the wagon version with even more hind space.

fiat,500l,2015,Joanne Straub, 02/23/2015,"Nifty and fun, nice extras",5,"I always start with the negatives I note.  First would be the fabric.  I'm simply not fond of it, it reminds me of heavy duty panty hose and seems to pick up dirt easily.  The center armrest is very high and awkwardly placed.  There is so much width the door armrest isn't really reachable, either.  That said...

I love driving this car.  After years of soccer mom-mobiles, I wanted something small, easy to maneuver and park, better on gas, and fun.  However, we have two large dogs and stepkids on weekends.  This is a perfect blend for us.  Room for five without needing a shoehorn, and not like driving a Sherman tank.

2 years later.  I still LOVE this car.  Except for a couple of minor sensor issues fixed under warranty it has been trouble free.  Our summer here of 120 and higher do hurt the mileage, about 25mpg in summer, but I get a solid 33mpg in the cooler months.  Has had regular dealer maintenance.  I've replaced a headlight bulb, a reverse light bulb, tires, and brakes in 50k miles.  So I will be a repeat customer.  I still get compliments on my little beep beep!!!

fiat,500l,2015,Liane, 11/15/2015,More spacious than it looks - Trekking way to go!,5,"I had been waiting for the 2016 models to come out, but I found the body on the 2015 500L Trekking model to be a far more attractive and more Italian look. I ended up buying the 2015 500L Trekking with the ""Beats"" sound system with SiriusXM satellite radio, AISIN Heavy Duty 6-speed automatic transmission and U-connect touch screen. I use it for driving around San Francisco with all the hills and find it handles well. I love the headlights that move to follow your turns and curves. It is very easy to fold down the rear seats and create a spacious flat cargo area. The back seats also have the ability to recline to an almost flat bed like seat. The dual climate control keeps the front seat passengers happy and as the driver I enjoy the comfort of Power driver 4-way Lumbar Adjust. 

The visibility is amazing! With large windows all around and front pillar split by glass and wraparound rear windows. I also own a VW Touareg and honestly have better visibility in this Fiat.  Features like the rear backup camera, rear park assist system and  hands-free phone connectivity add to safety and convenience. The 17-inch wheels hold the road well even when driving on the freeway in rain. 

All in all for the price I paid I feel very satisfied with my new car and must admit I enjoy the compliments from those who notice it in the bright yellow and black combination. The gloss black instrument panel bezels are a beautiful upgrade included in the Urbana Trekking Collection 1.

fiat,500l,2015,Scott, 03/30/2017,Best Kept Secret,5,"Really do not understand the negative press reviews for this car.  This is my second FIAT, trading up from the 500 to the 500L.  I've come to the conclusion that people in this country reject things that are different or unique.  The design of the 500L is ingenious - for its size it has amazing interior volume.  The ride is very comfortable and it has a great seating position, sitting higher than many crossovers.  I'm not sure why the press reviews say the car is under-powered. The engine is turbocharged and - at least in mine - when I hit the pedal that car MOVES!  It handles quite well and is fun to drive, even for as tall as it is.  Most reviewers have highly criticized the looks of the 500L but I have only gotten nice compliments on it.  With all those windows, the high seating position, and spotter mirrors on both sides, all around visibility is amazing!  FIAT has some quirky features and design elements, but I think they make the car all that more appealing.  Some of the interior trim could be nicer, but most cars today are filled with hard plastics - most of the hard plastic surfaces are slightly textured, so I don't think they look cheap.  I have almost 20,000 miles on mine and aside from routine maintenance, the only issue I've had was with a rattle in the back (fixed by the dealer on the first visit).  FIAT stands behind their products with an impressive 4 year/50,000 mile warranty, too.  On one hand, it is a shame this car doesn't sell better, but I have never been one to drive what everyone else is driving, so I like driving what I consider to be the best keep secret out there!  I would absolutely but another one without any hesitation.  Do yourself a favor - ignore the press critics and focus on the reviews of people who drive these cars day in and day out.

fiat,500l,2015,Honolulu Owl, 05/21/2016,I sold this nightmare,1,"I sold this garbage car as soon as my family figured out that FIAT will not fix transmission overheating problem. One day, this garbage stopped on the road right after exiting McDonalds' drive-thru while giving out really bad smell. I could smell, my wife could smell, even the employees at the restaurant could smell the burning or melting odor. The car didn't start for 10 min. with an on-screen message like I need to put the gear to N then R then P or something. Now, it started to run again. I searched internet because it was Sunday and the FIAT dealership didn't provide any repair service. BTW, I found out that there are several issues just like me. And, more importantly, all of these reviews reported that both dealership and FIAT headquarter denied to identify and fix this issue. Only solution was just to continue driving this garbage with fear. Well next Monday, I brought this car to the dealership, and their reaction was ""exactly"" same with other reviews. ""Can't replicate or duplicate the issue"", ""There is no error record on the computer"" and ""Drive your car home as is"". 
Next day, I went to a Japanese car dealership and sold the garbage and bought much more reliable car. If you are rich, you can buy FIAT. But, if you wanted be frugal and smart, go to more reliable automakers. FIAT's reliability is 28th out of 28 automakers in 2015 Consumer Report.

The best part of owning this car is how easy it is to get in and out of.  It is tall so it feels like a much larger vehicle. Large doors and the back seat  with a almost flat floor makes it easy for rear passengers.   I am a fan of the U-Connect system.  The outward visibility is aided by a high driving position.

fiat,500l,2016,Don Barkel, 08/06/2016,Fiat 500L - Much better than you've heard,5,"I continue to be amazed by the relatively poor reviews given to this car by the ""experts"".  We have had ours for 1 1/2 years now and continue to find it a quality car with excellent driving characteristics and versatility.   Give it a chance and you will love it.   I know people have concerns about Fiat reliability.  All I can say is that since we bought it we have been back to the dealer just once for routine oil change.

Update:  Our Fiat continues to perform flawlessly.  I love how it drives, very nimble and oh so practical.  Still no reliability problems.   Back for routine service (oil changes) only.   Remain puzzled by the continued poor reviews of this car.  I would encourage you to at least look at it and test drive if you are in the market for a small cross-over.

Update:  We are now at 30,000 miles and our Fiat 500L continues to perform flawlessly.   We continue to enjoy the practicality of the car but also its fun factor.  I still don't get the negative reviews from so many ""experts"".   Reliability has been perfect - we literally have had nothing needing to be fixed other than a software update done at a routing oil change.  

Update:  now at 20,000 miles and 2+ years of ownership.  Continue to be very pleased with the handling, economy, practicality, and yes, RELIABILITY.    We have had zero repair issues with this car so and it continues to drive like new.  Again a very underrated car.  Give one a look and test drive and see what you think

Update:  now at 3 years of  ownership and we continue to love our Fiat 500L.   Sadly because of what ji can only consider to be biased reviews, sales for the model have not  been good.   I would suggest that if you are in the market for a small crossover or  wagon type of  vehicle that you at least look at this car and decide for yourself.  Our  reliability has been perfect - no problems at all.  It handles great, good mpg, and very practical.  What is not too like about it?

fiat,500l,2017,CoachRick, 09/29/2019,"This is our second ""Elle"" and we are quite pleased",4,"So, I had the '15 L (called her Elle, too...nicknamed the '17 Elle Marshma'Elle'ow)in for service and spotted a white '17L on the lot with a banner in the windshield(this was almost two years ago).  Asked the salesperson to work the numbers on trading out their very last '17L with our '15L (both were Lounge models) and  I had our new car that afternoon!  The white '17L with pano moonroof was equipped the same as our '15 that had 34k miles on it...but with the addition of the moonroof on the '17).
Seems FIAT re-mapped the throttle response a bit and made the '17 just a little quicker off the line; but, otherwise, the vehicles were darned near identical(BEATS sound and nav in both, btw).
I knew I was trading too soon to get the value out of the '15; but I'm happy with the purchase roughly 21 months later.
The L has quite a large cargo capacity for such a small footprint.  My 29er mountain bike fits in the back and my wife's ""light"" home staging goodies will fit when no one thinks it's possible!
The higher seating position and fantastic visibility are great pluses to me!  Some people think the seating is too high and there is TOO MUCH glass all around(really???  You don't want to be able to see??? )  We are surrounded by a sea of large pick-ups and SUVs here in Texas and I don't mind one bit not looking out to see the door handles on those vehicles.  In fact, it's one of the main reasons we bought the first 500L(people don't complain about the ride height of their ""utility"" vehicles, do they?).  We've driven 3000 miles in two weeks on 75mph super highways and then mountain roads and find the ride quality just fine.  The upright seating is a plus(of course, you can recline and adjust the seats to fit your fancy).

The off-the-line performance is not that of a race car for sure; but it's got every bit the zip of many small wagon/hatch type vehicles.  On-ramp speeds are fine as the car moves along smartly in 3rd-4th gears, making merging or leaving traffic on Texas highways safe and comfortable.  I've cruised in the 80-85mph range for hours at a time, all the while getting over 30mpg on 87 octane with the AC howling in the 95-105 degree temps.(All that glass does invite an increased 'greenhouse' effect, so extra tinting is recommended if you live in a sunny/hot climate like central Texas)

As with the '15L, we've had a couple of warranty issues with the '17; but nothing debilitating and nothing the dealer(studio) couldn't handle right zippy.  I had many more problems with my near $40k Acura RDX than I've had with either FIAT.  The FOUR-year, 50k mile warranty is a plus, just in case little gremlins do show up as Elle gets a bit of age on her.  That's a significant boost in warranty coverage compared to some other eco-hatch/wagons.

Parking the Elle is not as easy as parking the 'regular' 500 series as the L is almost two feet longer.  HOWEVER, the turning radius is really tight and when you are pulling into a 90-degree parking situation, the L will surprise you with more nimbleness than you might expect...about 1/3-turn more!  You turn to what would be the limit on many vehicles and the L lets you turn just a little more!!!)  Backing the L is easy, too.   Of course, the back-up camera helps; but there is nary a blind spot as you look ""through"" the right-side rear quarter of the vehicle(nearly all glass!).

All in all, this is a very nice vehicle for what it is...economical, easy to drive, reasonably peppy and quite capacious.  Would we enjoy a KIA Soul or Juke or CX-3 as much???  Not sure; but I like what we have with the FIAT 500L.   After owning a number of vehicles costing nearly twice as much, we are tickled to find such a capable and comfortable vehicle in the low-mid $20k range!!!

March '20 update of sorts...
Taking Elle in for her 30k mile service this week(IF the Corona virus doesn't shut down the dealer service dept).  Other
 than the radio gremlin(defaults to 670 AM or some such from time to time), I really don't have any issues with the little wagon.  Mixed MPG on our stop and go Texas highways is pretty close to 30...and highway MPG still looks to be 15% higher than that...all on Top Tier 87 fuel.  Not bad for a capable hauler.
My plan is to keep this Elle until the 4/50 warranty runs out before seriously looking for another vehicle.  Depending on how our '13 Volvo C70 is holding up at that time(roughly 2022), we might hang on to the FIAT or even ADD a 500C(onvertible) to the garage.  Dealing with vehicles closer to $20K vs $45K has become a delight!!

Oct 2020  Update...
Shortly after posting the previous update, ""Elle"" developed a ""leak"" of some engine compartment fumes into the passenger compartment.  At times, it smelled like exhaust from an old truck, on occasion the smell had a petro(oil?) component to the smell.  This was quite disturbing as it continued intermittently for days until I could get back to the dealer.  NO repair was available and we immediately traded the car for a Volvo XC40.

The brakes are grabby and annoying-and the ride is super loud. I wish I had noticed these things on my test drive but I didn’t realize them until driving the car a few weeks. The uconnect system on my 2015 is terrible. Voice recognition is awful and I have to constantly re sync the Bluetooth. I bought the car for it’s look and should have done better research.
**Update** As I closed in on year 3, my car and it's sensor issues continued. The temperature was somewhere between 10-20 degrees off. The replace bulb turned on every 4-6 weeks. 
The airbag light was on, even though the dealer confirmed there was nothing wrong with the airbags.
The Uconnect system is terrible. The voice recognition is a joke, and my sirius XM has more dead zones than good zones.
I've had enough!!
Traded in the Fiat for a Ford Escape. The only thing I miss is the panoramic sunroof.

fiat,500l,2019,Bill in TX, 11/15/2019,Great For What It Is,5,"My 2014 500L Trekking has been 100% reliable to date, and with a manual transmission is fun to drive! I am old enough to remember when Italian cars had a reputation for unreliability, but that was a long time ago and I do not believe that the current crop should be tarred with that brush. Interior room is great...lots of headroom and legroom both front and back, as well as good cargo capacity in back. FWD provides good traction in poor weather, and the 6-speed manual transmission helps in that department, too. Performance is good in general. Acceleration will not pin your ears back, nor can you fling it at high speeds through hairpin curves, but if that is what you are looking for, then you probably aren't even considering this car in the first place.

To summarize, the Fiat 500L Trekking is a good, reliable car that is fun to drive. BTW, speaking of reliability, I have been a Land Rover owner in the past and know current Land/Range Rover owners....in terms of reliability I will take my 500L over an Evoque any day, hands down.

Con's:
Issues with the VIN#'s, resulted in me having a hard time insuring the Car.  It would have been nice if the dealership told me about this known issue before I drove off the lot!!!  I was only able to find one insurer for my new car, which means I didn't get the best rate.  I went back to the dealership and they provided me with a VIN # verification form- hopefully that does the trick.  They slipped a piece of paper in my car, with information about the issue when I bought the car. Again, it would have been nice if they addressed the issue up front.

I leased the car and the dealer didn't really go over what maintenance is covered under the warranty/lease. Where as we just leased a Toyota for my husband and they scheduled the first oil change in 6 months before we even left the dealership. 

Back seat is just large enough for passengers, but I imagine somebody 6' tall would have issues back there.

Overall, I'm very happy with the car so far.

fiat,500x,2016,John, 10/26/2016,I traded my Miata for this!,5,"After owning my 500x Trekking Plus for over a year now I can say I love it even more.  Its served us well , we’ve gone on several road trips and even started a new biz with her. ( Online Antiques and a booth in Vero Beach )  Fiat is a great value.. and gets a bad rap, its connection to Mopar doesnt help. In a year of owning the car the only thing to fail was a Chrysler sourced MOPAR  design fan assembly that Fiat ( FCA ) took care of immediately.  Mopar fans have a long history of failures in many Dodge- Chrysler vehicles. But FCA is great. They told me it was imperative I get the car back into the dealer and  they had the car for three weeks  ( parts delay ) but they rented another car for me and I paid nothing .  My dealers customer service was above par.  So see my experience with my Fiat is that it’s been 100% reliable except for the American part that failed.   But she is back running better than ever and I have no complaints .  My original review contnues now.. 

Due to an unknown injury I came down with severe sciatica in my left leg and hip. My doctor said it was probably  exaserbated by twisting in and out of my low to the ground 2013 Mazda MX5. So I was on the hunt for something that was easy to get into. By far, and I have owned 25 cars now in my lifetime as a 55-year-old man, the  Fiat 500 X is the most comfortable car I have ever driven.  Plus after even after having Mercedes and BMWs I find it's electronics , infotainment system and build quality, superior. Fiat is right up there with Mazda in their top-of-the-line cars giving consumers the most bang for the buck you can possibly get for under 30,000. Even  a stripper Fiat comes with creature comfort's that you don't see another cars like  fully automatic headlamps.  Such a minor thing but a nicety none the less . My Fiat 500 X Trekking Plus is top-of-the-line and is only missing one option , the all-wheel-drive feature and the only reason I don't have it is because it's next to impossible to get in Florida for some reason.  None of the dealers are ordering it. But never mind, my car comforts me with the heated seats ,the leather,  cornering lamps  (by the way the cornering lambs are amazing, like personal luxury  cars of yesteryear) the dual pane panoramic sunroof, Beats stereo , navigation, back up cam, crash sonar, ...omg the list goes on...it's gonna probably take me two weeks to figure out how to operate every single feature this car has. And with all the geegaws comes a glass smooth ride with none of that herky-jerky transmission stuff that other people talk about, and the solid feel that you get when you shut a BMW door..that wonderful muffled thunk.   Plus, my dealer extends the warranty to 10 years 100'000 miles !  I think that Fiat is undervalued and this car is a game changer for the Fiat brand in America.
I want to address some of the bad reviews this car gets.  In reading them, I find the people who write negative comments about the cars transmission, hesitation, etc are probably bad drivers, or have expectations that could not be met by a crossover.   In owning my car and having driven several others in its class , the Fiat 500x offers the best value.  For instance , the 500x Trekking Plus has a power seat, the Mazda CX3 doesn't. It's not available. The CX3 gets praise from auto journalists, but it's based on the old Mazda 2 which was a dog and sold poorly.  So much for objectivity, the Mazda 2 has been dropped. .  Also ,to write a review based on simply driving a rental, should not be alllowed!  Rental cars get beat to Hades and back.  The 500x takes getting used to. I had to learn how the electric parking brake works, it's not the most intuitive thing. But the 500x truly  is a fun, well built rig.

fiat,500x,2016,Wm. Skelley, 11/08/2015,Beware...,1,"Purchased this Fiat 500X Trek, several weeks ago. I experienced my first breakdown, halfway, during my one hour drive home from the dealer. It shut off at 40 mph, and was difficult to start afterwards. Was instructed by my salesperson to take it to the service department the very next day, which I did, with the engine light on for the entire trip. They read the onboard diagnostic. The service tech expained that the computer was reading fault codes and self correcting as it learns. This conclusion set uneasy with me, but I was inclined to take my service manager's advise. Was sent out the door with instructions to return if any further problems. 
This very same day, I made it half way home, when I stopped for a soda. Upon attempting to restart my vehicle, it would not start. After several attempts of starting the moter, I called the service dept back to report my problem, but was only able to leave a message. After waiting 20 minutes for thier call back, I again attempted to start the motor, and was successfull. Engine light was on however, and it seems to be running out of tune, with little power. The service department finally returned my call, and instructed me to return the vehicle again, which I did the very next day. And was awarded a rental car.
After about 8 days, I was advised that my Fiat had a new onboard body computer module installed, and that it was fine and ready for pick up. 
I finally made my first successful trip home with this car. However, the very next day, The vehicle became difficult to start, and remained in 3rd gear at all times, with the engine light on. So, again, another call to the service department, and I was advised to have the vehicle towed, which I did with the assistance of the Fiat Roadside Assistance, and a local towing service, and was awarded another rental vehicle.
After several days, I was advised that there was a loose/corroded ground wire on the side of my transmission, which was repared, and my vehicle was ready for pick up. Once again, I picked up my vehicle, and did make a successful trip home. However... the very next day, having driven about 30 miles, the vehicle shut off while driving at about 25 mph. I did finally restart, but stayed in 3rd gear at all times, and showed an engine light on. I pulled off the road again, and called the service department. There were several attempts at reaching them on this occassion. And my family and I found ourselves stranded for some significant period of time. After a long period of time, the vehicle restarted, engine light did stay on, however it was switching through the automatic gears successfully, so I limped the car back home. Once again, another rental vehicle and yet another tow sevice back to the service department, where my vehicle sits at this time. 
To summerize, my vehicle has been in service 4 times in as many weeks, remains there to date, has less than 500 miles, all of them being to the service department and back. I have serveral hundred dollars tied up in rental car deposits, and am very disappointed. The most distressing thing is shutting down while in motion. I find this to be very dangerous under some driving and traffic conditions. I will on Monday, ask this Fiat dealer to buy back my car. It is my hope that this car is the ""lemon:, and not the entire model. As I do really like this line up of cars, I am sure my dealer could satifactory place me in another like and kind of Fiat, 500X AWD, and look forward to that discussion.
Just saying...beware.
Okay, 2 years later. After a very hard and lengthy bout with Chrysler Fiat, my Fiat was determined to be a ""lemon"", and was replaced. It's been a couple years in my new Fiat. At this time, this new 500x continues to run strong, with regular maintenance as oil changes, etc... Only complaint I have at this time, would be the trim of the vehicle. It's all glued from factory, and has
 been coming off all around the car. That would be the rubber and chrome strips and moldings. Leaving a very sticking substance underneath that seams to get on everything. Clothes, hands, the dog. Very annoying, and ugly looking.
But hey, it starts and goes. Would not purchase another one though. Good Luck.

fiat,500x,2016,GregC, 07/21/2016,Fun and Luxury in the Same Package,5,"I have owned my FIAT 500X for almost 7000 miles, and I could not be happier with my decision.  I had narrowed my choices down to the Honda CRV, Kia Sportage, and the 500X.  Each vehicle had a nice ride and good acceleration, and also had its particular strong points.  For instance, the CRV-EX had several cool features (sunroof, lane watch, etc.) and got the best gas mileage.  The Sportage had a nice interior and the largest back seats and cargo area.  The FIAT was the most comfortable and looked great inside and out; I would compare the interior to a luxury SUV, but for half the price.  I briefly looked at the Mini Countryman S, but I did not want to pay for a turbo charger (just one more expensive item to break) to get an adequate amount of power.  
I read many reviews (Edmunds and elsewhere) that gave the FIAT negative marks for their transmission and their acceleration.  I will say that I needed to get used to the gas pedal, it is different from any other car I have driven.  Once I figured out how to press the pedal (I know it sounds crazy, but give it a week or so), my driving experience became much more enjoyable.  That was when I no longer experienced the “jerkiness” that many of the reviews had mentioned.  Instead, I found that the silky smooth transmission shifts quicker than other cars, and it is even more fun to drive in the “Sport” mode.  The engine is really strong and quiet, and the ride is smooth and quiet at highway speeds.  More importantly, passing at highway speeds is very easy.  I have not experienced any of the hesitation that other reviewers have mentioned, and most of the time I am at or over the speed limit much quicker than I expect.  Gas mileage has been good but not great at 28 MPG, but this is a very small price to pay for such a nice car.  
In addition to the engine and transmission, I cannot say enough good things about the interior and the technology.  It has higher ground clearance, so I can get in and out of it very easily.  The seats and the dash layout really feel like they came out of a much more expensive European luxury SUV.  I did not get all of the “bells and whistles” on my model, but I did want the options that are made to keep me and my family safe.  The one I use most often is the “Rear Cross Path Detection” that informs me about unseen vehicles approaching from the side when backing out of a parking space.  Very nice.
The FIAT 500X really has made my commute more fun and enjoyable, and I never thought I would say that about a vehicle.

fiat,500x,2016,Lars, 07/14/2016,Weeks of research led me to this great decision,5,"After my wife and I (and eventually our two teenagers) shared a VW Beetle for 12 years, we wanted to get a new car.  I researched the VW Beetle turbo, which I loved but my wife wanted a four door. Drove the VW GTI which I also loved but that's a cramped racer, we needed more room. Seriously considered a Nissan Juke AWD (turbo) -- the Nissan has excellent power but it's got small cargo capacity and most of all the Nissan has a loud cabin at highway speeds. Tried out a Subaru XV (good cargo capacity but lousy power) and a Subaru Forester (so ugly, and too large), and VW GTI.  I kept coming back to the Fiat 500x, test drove one on three different occasions.  Here's why I chose the Fiat, and what I think of the car after driving it for just three days.

You get a quiet ride with the 500x, at 80 MPH the car just floats along like a luxury car.  Quieter than the Subaru XV, the 500x also holds the road like a substantial vehicle whereas the XV seems more like a lightweight.  The 500x is so much quieter than the Juke, you can hardly compare them (though the Juke has turbo and pulls with greater power).

Styling of the 500x (Trekking) is superior, and it grows on you.  Every time I look at the 500x I like it more!

Seats are comfortable on long distance drives.  I made one 500 mile trip the day after purchase, and I fit right in to the seats.  My 500x has manual, non-heated, fabric seats.  I like the brown leather upgraded seats offered, but didn't want to pay the high price for the options package that includes them.

I have also tested the AWD function, as we had a freak rain storm yesterday.  You turn the dial to traction mode and it really works.  You can view the wheel spin percentages for each wheel on your dash, but choosing that option with the steering wheel controls.  I don't know how this technology has been developed but it seems very sophisticated.  All of this for a brand new car I bought for about $23,000.  What a great value.  Thank you Fiat.

Update January 2018 — 32,000 miles on the car and it still looks and drIves great. Zero problems.

Update January 2020 — 68,000 miles.  I did have a mechanical issue with the coolant system. It required a new part.  Other than that, no problems. Interior still looks good. I like the quality of the seats.  Paint looks new.  At idle in gear the car shakes a bit more than you’d think is normal.  Very pleased with the purchase.

fiat,500x,2016,PS, 12/04/2016,Better than i thought,4,"After owning the 500X over a year I figured a review might help some people interested in the car. It's actually much better than most people give credit for. Fiat does indeed have some issues but most are for the 500 or 500L. The 500X is the only Fiat available in the US that's actually made in Italy, and shares the platform with the Jeep Renegade. I have the base model ""POP"" and actually very happy I got that one, the 6 speed manual gives a sporty feel and the little turbo 1.4L (same as in 500 Abarth) loves to rev, it sounds pretty cool too. The interior is much better even in the low end trim, the fabric is comfortable and it doesn't feel all cheap plastic inside like Honda,Hyundai etc. Make sure you Scothguard the fabric seats though they stain just from rain (but clean up well). I have had no problems yet at 10K miles, time will tell but all cars have problems at some point. If you're in the market for a small crossover it's worth a test drive and for the money the POP really has everything most people need in a daily driver (just get some nice aftermarket speakers/sub for the audio system)

Update 12/12/17:
Happy to report no issues at 22K miles. Still feels a solid buy and no rattles,squeaks or leaks.
Fiat gets bashed a lot & maybe for good reason, but I’ve owned Toyota’s ,Honda’s, Fords and Mazda’s but never felt a connection to them like I do to my lil bambina! Those cars are good yes & so are many others, but they have no personality, no soul.

Excellent quality, great value, and it fits like a glove. I read the reviews about it being crammed and the whining about the way it shifts. I'm 5' nothing so I have no issues with room. Power delivery is very smooth and more than enough for this class. Very comfortable both in town and on the freeway. I'm not worried about reliability. I also own a 500C and have never had any issues with it. Fiat may not be popular and that's fine with me. I get to drive something I love and not see 20 of them in the parking lot everywhere I go. I'm also getting great mileage to boot :)

fiat,500x,2016,Jeff Briggs, 03/01/2016,Almost 3 years with the Fiat 500x,5,"We have owned the car for almost 3 years and have had no major problems with the car.  We have gone through several dealerships in Dallas as one closed and a new one opened up.  They have done a good job for the scheduled maintenance and have taken care of all of its needs.  I upgraded with door sill covers and the spare tire kit.  I highly recommend those items.  Thanks FIAT!  We love our European crossover.

Sept-19: Entering the 4th year of ownership and we have had only minor issues.  There was a recall notice regarding the radiator fan.  Dealership took care of this in quick order.

Also the AWD seems to handle the rain better than our FWD Corolla. Notice some reviews complain on the shifting, my experience switch to ""sport"" when you know you need more responsive shifting. Works for us. Not really comfortable front seats but for a compact SUV I can live with it. Only real complaint is the factory navigation and trying to find an update for it online. Google maps very up to date but would like NAV to be updated so I can leave phone alone totally and use factory hands free. Look forward to this fall/winter to see how the AWD holds up.

fiat,500x,2016,Michael M, 12/22/2017,Unreliable little car; terrible customer service,1,"I have had this car for just over two years -- it has just under 13K miles on it and has been in the shop 9 (yes 9!) times.  There have been 5 problems, including a broken tailgate latch, a broken door handle, a broken speaker, a malfunctioning forward collision mitigation system (which took 5 times to fix!) and now an engine warning light with a message saying ""drive selection mode not available.""  Despite paying an extra $3,000 for an upgraded warranty that includes a loaner car, I have to argue with the dealer every time to actually get that loaner car.  In total I have been without this car for weeks on end and an really tired of taking it in for service and with dealing with uncaring and incompetent service personnel.  For the current problem I have now been without my car for two weeks, and when I called FCA headquarters I was told that the dealership hasn't even looked at it yet...how is that acceptable?  And FCA customer care...they have been of little help.  They denied a lemon law claim and that department refused to even call and tell me.  They had the woman who I spoke to at customer care make the call and she left me a message that sounded like she was being held hostage...she was so apologetic and actually said ""they are making me call you and I'm really sorry they won't respond to you"" -- how often do you end up feeling bad for the customer service staff?  Geez....  So, in summary, let me say that purchasing this car has been a horrible mistake.  Until FCA actually does something to make this right, my new goal in life is to warn others away from purchasing any of their vehicles...buyer beware!!

The back is so-so. Great for kids or smaller people. I bought the 2.4 AWD. It hugs the road nicely. The auto shifting is a bit rough. It takes some time getting used to. The stereo rocks, and there are USB ports. It was very easy to sync the phone. The middle screen on the dash has a lot of computer ""stuff"" that you can program. IE-Alerts you when you are going a certain speed that you have set, outside temp, miles to empty etc. Plus you can have it show digitally MPH (The speedometer to the left of that screen actually is the ""old school"" 20, 30, 40 etc with the lines for each 5MPH increment. All in all I give it a 4. I would give it a 5, but it's a bit slow pulling into traffic. It doesn't ""lag"", however. It slowly but steadily increases in speed. It's a quiet ride, and once you hit 70+ MPH it's very smooth. I like it! THUMBS UP.

fiat,500x,2016,Abe, 07/23/2016,Fun little SUV,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed driving Fiat 500X during a recent trip in spite of trying my friend's Mazda 3 (rental again) during the same period. I liked - free revving engine/confidence inspiring handling/steering etc. Not so liked - interior space (as expected), a little jerky transmission at times on some mode.
Please find the video I shot during the trip - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ8pY-3twms. 
My reliability rating is of course based on my rental period - the car almost had 20000 miles in it and was as good as new except for few scratches both inside and out (unlike a regular Fiat 500 I rented some time back which had a broken seat folding liver and couple of loose parts at around 45000 miles).

fiat,500x,2016,Kelly, 07/22/2016,I Love My Baby!!,5,"I saw an ad on this car early last year, and I immediately fell in love. First I was bummed because it wasn't going to be out for a few more months. Finally it came out.... Yay!! I took it out for a few test drives, waited for some people to buy it and put out reviews, which took forever and still there's hardly any out there. I was scared  because not too many reviews and the ones that were out there were not that good. I've always owned Honda's, so I was hesitating, test driving other vehicles. I tried the Honda HRV, seemed very cheap to me. So I kept searching the inventory for my little fiat, I wanted a white lounge model with black leather seats and a sunroof, they had them within 50 miles of me, but by the time I got more serious about finally going and getting it of course they didn't have any within 200 miles of me that had the sunroof... So mine doesn't have the sunroof, but that's ok, I was kind of worried about the mesh that's up there any ways, because the sunlight comes in the car a little too much, the lady I spoke to at one the dealer's said you could tint the sunroof, but I also thought that the mesh will eventually deteriorate......Anyhow I got a fantastic deal on mine.... And I Love, Love, Love it!! I think I will name it Marshmallow, My 20 year old daughter's idea. I've had my baby since February and I haven't had any real issues with it. The one thing is when you lock the doors with the button outside, sometimes you have to press it a few times. The transmission is a little tetchy and not real quick off the line, that's ok I guess, Fewer tickets... I was worried it wouldn't get up hills very good, but it does just fine.  The seats are super comfortable. And like another reviewer mentioned is the cool gas cap, there isn't one, yay! You just open the door and boom, you stick the nozzle in and you can't just stick any thing in there either, so you don't have to worry people will still your gas..... I was on the fence about this car (even though I really wanted it) I was worried because it's a Fiat and not a Honda, but now everyday I go outside and see my little baby, I'm so glad I got it.

In my opinion, you don't purchase a FIAT because it's more dependable than a Honda or because it has a better resale value than a Toyota.  FIAT ownership is about discernment for a stylish automobile.  It's about passion.  Driving with pride of ownership -- as opposed to those who buy a car to get them ""from point 'A' to point 'B'"".  The FIAT 500x is a vehicle that you WANT to drive.  I wait anxiously for the end of my work day so I can get to the reward... driving my Italian automobile.

Meet Donatella who sat in the showroom with the shiny white and chrome finish, the huge sunroof open to let the light show off the tobacco leather interior and then the moves of the effortless 2.5L and taught starring and ride sold me. However, that same day in a quad-fecta of Midtown Manhattan, I drove and bargained for the Q3, X1, Countryman, 500X and then before buying the next day, I threw in the ringer of the HR-V. Over some tense deliberations at Dunkin Donughts, the spouse and I agreed to throw out logic and get the Fiat. Yes, we've been back to the dealer for squeaky breaks and a blown fuse for the locks,  but Fiat of Manhattan has been nothing but professional and accomodating with walk-in Saturday service. I've enjoyed nice lunches in Midtown and walks in Central Park and I knew very well that except for the HR-V, we'd see the dealer again.

I've never had a car that got so many looks. We are often pointed out as being the ""blue pill car"", people look at it in passing and point, take pictures. I'm a star at the Whole Foods parking lot. I got followed to another gourmet food place in Redhook by a lady who came up to tell me she knew to follow the Fiat as that type of car would know where to go. The guy at my local car wash asked if the interior was custom! 

For particulars, I find the transmission unnoticeable for the most part. When I want to notice, I'm rather impressed with the execution but do thing it's a little over the top for such a vehicle. The engine is smooth, smooth, smooth and pleanty powerful. Donatella does like to drink in the city at 19mpg but does take it easy on the N.J. Turnpike at 30mpg with cruise mostly set at 75, um 79mph. Uconnct works very well and so much easier than the BMW/Mini system as it shows as much love for my Android as it does for my Apple phones. The dog seems happy with the back seat. The sunroof is a huge favorite and the fixed glass part over the back seat opens that space up tremendously compared to all but the X1. 

I feel for the previous reviewers on here. I knew going into a new build from two manufacturers not know for reliability that there would be issues, but that was the same for BMW/Mini and Audi. I read up on the USA 500xmweb forum and most known issues have bulletins on the faults. I randomly joined an Italian FB group and they go bonkers over the car but also have some similar issues. I don't need a daily driver and honestly, if the dealer keeps it overnight for some time, I'd just take the subway home and not have to worry about parking. I'd not recommend anything but a Honda/Mazda/Kia/Toyota as a daily driver but I've had those too over the years and frankly, I'm really enjoying the sense of occasion I'm getting with the Fiat. I just really enjoy Donatella's company, even when she's having an off day.

Update:
We just past 13000 miles and 1yr of ownership and that's more miles I've out on a car in a year that my last three. That may not sound like much but I fly for a living and live in NYC so I rarely put more than 9000 miles a year on a car. I still get the looks, friends new and old still complement the car and are even surprised it's a Fiat. More importantly, I simply like getting in it and driving it. I've had a few rental SUV's lately and although they had their strengths, getting back in the Fiat 500x at the end of a trip just shows me the sense of occasion few other products offer.

That said, the 9-spd auto is still a work in progress but sometimes just works a treat and sometimes just reminds you a lot is going on. It is never rude but perhaps not always in the background. The locks blew a fuse and was fixed right away on a Saturday afternoon dealer service visit while I went for a coffee. We only had one big snow fall this past winter and at 31"" in one night, I don't care what you have, dig your own
 car out. We left the Fiat covered for over a week. Other than that, we love the sunroof, the heated seats and steering wheel, the remote start and the UConnect with SIRI. The sporty exhaust along with the sometimes and surprisingly sporty down and up shifts remind you someone with a soul added a bit to the car. 

With my yearly mileage, fuel economy isn't a real deal for me with class leading to class last equaling about $200 a year when figured with $4.00/gallon fuel. Thus, and I just checked this, we averaged 20mpg even with 5800 miles at an average speed of 17mph. 80mph turnpike runs show 28mpg and more docile 70mph runs show 32mpg. Highway mpg is competitive but city mpg is really at the bottom and both are dissapointing considering the challenged 9-speed auto. 

I'm a happy owner and I think the character of the Fiat will keep me that way even if something nefarious comes up in the future.

UPDATE: At just under 16000 miles and 1-1/2 years with the 500x, the enjoyment of the Fiat is complemented via no maintenance visits in the last year. Loving the Fiat!

fiat,500x,2016,DaveA, 03/30/2016,The Fiat that could,5,"got this fiat 500x  on Feb 24 2016   it seams to be a good little SUV .   so far NO problems.   have about 2500 miles on it now.
it rides good ,  easy to get in and out since it doesn't sit low  .   

I liked the style of it  have been asked several times about it when getting gas and things.

I was used to a subura crosstrak  but after a wreck  couldnt afford another subura .  this is almost the same .

I traded the car in Aug2016 got other crosstrak  as I do miss the fiat .  I didn't have problems  with the car , the value wasn't there . 
yes I would say get one but yet again  its up the person.  I like suburas .  Sorry Fiat .   dealership is closer and where I go theres subura dealerships in MT .

fiat,500x,2016,Michelle, 08/25/2016,Love my 500X,5,"I love my car. I drove several different cross-overs and loved this one. I asked for a longer factory warranty and got it--89 months/100,000 miles. I have had no problems with my car and drive it daily.

Update: I still love my car. In over a year the only thing it has needed was an oil change. It got me through snow during the winter, pouring rain in the PNW, and to work every day.

Almost 2 years later and i still love my 500x. Still no problems.

fiat,500x,2016,Jeff Douglas, 10/29/2016,Love it so far,5,"Got a great offer on a lease with the 500X and I'm glad we took advantage of it. So far with a couple highway trips and a lot of downtown driving we are very hoppy with the car. The only complaint I can come up with is the way the trim levels are structured, but between the nice interior that is way more subtle and stylish than it's Jeep counterpart, the ease of driving, and the driving position in the vehicle we are very satisfied.

fiat,500x,2016,jlm6469, 11/28/2016,Great Car For The Price!!!,5,"I was looking for a car after a deer totaled my beloved Prius.  Because we're moving to the country and it's West Virginia, an AWD was high on the list of must haves.  Went to the dealership intending to look at Imprezas.  When we got to the lot, we saw the 2 Imprezas on my list, and then noticed this little darling tucked in the corner with AWD on the windshield.  At first we both chuckled, then walked up for a closer look.  It was pretty much love at first sight!  The car is charming, both exterior and interior.  Got the keys, got in, and said, ""Wow, these seats are comfortable!""  Took it for a spin both in town and on the highway, and was pleasantly surprised at how nimble it is to drive, comfort was great, and speed -- let's just say this car has pickup!!  It was so smooth on the highway, my husband said, ""honey, you're going to have to watch your speed in this.""  Went back to the dealership to check out the Imprezas (since that's what we went for), sat in one and immediately got out.  Didn't even take it out of the parking spot.  Walked back in, asked for the Fiat 500x Easy keys back, and drove it home that day.  The drive home was 2 hours, and I loved every minute of it.  My husband drove it all the next while we ran errands and said if he was in the market for a car, he'd look for one for himself.  No, it doesn't get the same gas milage as the Prius, but Prius doesn't make an AWD, and that was more important to me this time.  Bought it used, 2016, 10,000 miles on it, not one scratch or stain -- perfect contdition.  I love love love this car!!!!  Give it a try, you won't regret it!!!!

fiat,500x,2016,DST, 12/24/2017,4 year update,5,"I've owed my 500X Lounge for 4 years and have just under 40,000 miles and I still could not be any happier!  I just love driving this car!  I have not had any reliability issues and no repairs and FIAT has been really good about staying on top of any issues.  I had a recall for an engine cooling fan module that could fail due to improper lubrication in the bushings.  I didn't have any issues with mine but nice to know that the issue was addressed.  Transmission software updates were done which significantly improved the transmission performance.  My transmission mostly ran fine before the update but the hot summers could cause a rare ""dead"" response at times.  Since the updates, the transmission is running great with no hiccups and is smoother and quicker (though still slow to downshift).  One of the few complaints I had about the car was that there was excessive vibration at idle so FIAT issued a TSB where the motor mounts could be replaced at no cost.  I went to my dealership, Bill Luke FIAT and they replaced it without question.  Since then, the car feels like a COMPLETELY different vehicle.  The car starts smoother and all the vibration is gone.  If you own or buy a 2016 500X with the 2.4L and the car is still under warranty, go to your dealer and request that they replace the motor mounts under the TSB.  Other than that, the only low points are that fuel economy is just OK while the car is by no means fast.  Cargo space is limited with its sloped back design and the ride can get a little bouncy.  The high points are much more.  The car drives very nicely and has a great feel to it.  You feel well connected to the car and to the road.  The car is smooth, quite and handles well but all that improved significantly more when I replaced my factory Nexen tires (garbage tires) with Pirelli Cinturato P7s.  The seats are really comfortable and help alleviate my back pain.  The driving position is just right.  The car has a lot of features and they all work well and the materials and build quality have exceeded my expectations. My dealer, Bill Luke FIAT, has been fantastic!  I would strongly encourage anyone to buy one of these.

fiat,500x,2016,Raymond, 10/20/2016,Feel very happy about this purchase!,4,"The 500x wasn't my first choice. After carefully reading all the reviews about all the cars, I was torn between the Subaru Crosstrek and the 500x. It wasn't until I went for a test drive that pushed me over the edge. Sitting inside the 500x felt solid, comfortable, designed, and well thought out. Sitting inside the Crosstrek felt cheap and unrefined. This is with regards to the interior design. The drivability of the Subaru Crosstrek admittedly felt better. The gear system on the Subaru was smoother and lighter. Suspension felt supple. The 500x I test drove was a bit stiff, steering felt tight, but didn't hear the exaggerated loud cabin everyone complained about. I also didn't sense the jerky transmission. Perhaps it had been reprogrammed already. I purchased the car in Sep. 2016 and those issues have been addressed. My previous cars have been a 1998 VW Jetta, 2003 Audi A4, 2006 Honda Element, and most recently the 2013 Fiat 500e. I chose the 500x due to the extra incentive for being a return Fiat customer. Plus, the rebate, plus the dealer discount for end-of-year sale. The savings added up and it became a no-brainer to go with the 500x. The reviews had been so bad, that I really felt I made a compromise for the money saved. But so far, things have been great and all the claims had been unfounded. I find the handling of the 500x to be amazing. After I drop the kids off at school I take a longer drive through the hills of Los Gatos because the car is so fun to drive. I have also driven up steep hills and pushed the limits around corners and have yet to feel out of control. The acceleration is average, not as responsive as the electric 500e or the Audi 1.8T. I suppose that's comparing apples to oranges. I sat in the back of both Crosstrek and 500x and the differences were unnoticeable. They were both pretty snug with just enough leg room for somebody 5'8"". I do think that the 500x has a smaller trunk than the Crosstrek. Long story short, I don't feel I compromised just to get the better price. Side by side, if the prices were the same for the Crosstrek and the 500x, I'd still choose the 500x. It just has more personality and much nicer to look at. We'll have to see what the long term reliability holds up. But I'm comforted with a 48k/ 5 year bumper to bumper warranty.

fiat,500x,2016,Greg Carroll, 06/09/2018,"Undervalued, Underappreciated, but Great!!",5,"The Fiat 500X is a joy to drive and will put a smile on your face every time. It has plenty of power, although you won't win many races with it. It is very sure-footed as it has excellent grip and road manners, especially in the frozen stuff with the AWD system. And it is a safe car! I wrecked mine and it literally saved my life. You will enjoy the uniqueness of being one of very few on the road, but don't be concerned. The mechanicals are the same as the Jeep Renegade, so dealer maintenance will always be close by.
In 2018 I totaled my 500X in a rather violent accident. The car saved my bacon!! I'm alive today because of how safe it was. One year later I bought another 500X and couldn't be happier with it.

fiat,500x,2016,Bronzino, 07/15/2016,Great first car,5,"I got a Fiat 500X Lounge fully equipped just a couple of weeks ago. You can consider that this review comes from someone owning a car for the first time; I used to drive occasionally and rely on public transportation. This year I decided to have a car for a life style change, and researched many options similar to my Fiat 500X: Mazda X3, Nissan Juke, Audi Q3 (this one was way above the price I planned to pay for a car). Turns out that the Fiat 500X was an excellent choice! The car is a bit small, although I was not looking for big SUVs anyway, but access in the front seat is a little tight. Fuel economy was a bit of disappointment, I only got 13.5 MPG so far but I guess I mostly drive in the city, and that is why. The car is very artsy and extremely beautiful, the final touching in styling is impeccable and really beautiful, and the car stands out in the crowd. It is a very fast, comfortable car, I used to share driving a Prius and several Mazdas, and have to say that, for a car that is not as spacious, the Fiat 500X is very comfortable and roomy. The panoramic sunroof is very pretty from outside, and functional, easy to use from inside. Commands and controls on dashboard as very simple, and the car has a tech/vintage quality that goes very well all together. It is very, very pretty! I am not commenting on repair record yet (hopefully I will take some time before this), and the only disappointment is the fuel consumption in the city. Otherwise, it is just a very stylish, functional, fun, fast car. One hundred percent charming!

fiat,500x,2016,Ambra Patrick, 05/23/2017,Trouble from the beginning,1,"First of all it's had like 3 recalls since I bought the car.  It started in November I had a situation where I was making a left turn in traffic and the car said low oil pressure and cut off, it was a stoplight downtown Wilmington I had my nieces with me and car took a few minutes to crank.  We then had received a recall notification on the car so we figured it was related to that we took fiat to dealership to be serviced.  Had the car and it since has been doing it again and putting me in danger as well as my 2 year old baby.  The tires blew out after 4 months of having the fiat, there is no spare with the car so it had to be towed.  Next we had oil changed and was told we have a leak, he said oil levels shouldn't be so low after a recent oil change.  The parking light has also went out, Took car back to dealership to look at oil they kept car and said levels were low but couldn't determine why, drive car for 1000 miles and bring back for another test, meanwhile this morning as I'm heading out in the rain holding my baby the car door wouldn't open with the keyless remote and the car wouldn't unlock, I then pulled out the key to use and unlocked the car the alarm goes of and the car wouldn't crank and the back doors wouldn't open.  I then had To run back in house with my baby and grab my spare keys and they started the car.   As well as gas I was told this car would be great for my long commute and it isn't it's getting like 24 mpg.  I've had nothing but trouble with this car and I'm highly disappointed I was so excited to buy the 500x and now I'm regretful.   I hope fiat resolves this problem with integrity.

fiat,500x,2016,Donald Fitzpatrick, 01/28/2016,Biggest regret,1,"I purchased my first car on October 26th, 2015 this car was a fiat 500x. I left the dealership from which I purchased said car at around 8:30pm the following day at noon said car stalled and began smoking, then the Electric E-Brake turned on so I could not physically move it from the street shortly followed by the steering wheel completely locked up (the car had 81 miles on it), it took two hours for the tow truck to arrive to remove the car. It took two days for the dealer it was sent to to get back to me (which put me well past my return within 48 hours policy) at which time they said that the car had parts of the engine lying at the base of the compartment, this was not true the formal report stated that a rod shot through the engine, I was informed that there was a physical hole in the engine when more parts were needed as an excuse as to why I was without my car. They informed me they needed to order a NEW ENGINE to put in my new car, which took 2 weeks to arrive because they decided to let it come in on the next shipment of parts, after the engines arrival it took a week to have the engine put in (I was told when they said the engine needed to be replaced that it would take a MAXIMUM of 3 days to put in once it arrived) After the engine was in they tested the car to see if all was in working order it was not, a new fuse and starter would have to be ordered to make the car run, receiving and putting in said new pieces took a week and a half (at this point I was at a new car that I had in my possession for less that 24 hours had hit the 30th day in the shop mark)  once the new pieces were all in they tested to see if all was in working order once again it was however while giving it a thorough test-drive they noticed stalling on turns. Turned out that a new air intake valve was needed this added a little less than a full week to my already 4 weeks and 3 days in the shop for a problem that a new car should not be having. FINALLY I got the call on December 4th 2015 that my car was ready to be picked up, when I went to get my car the employees of the dealership this car was sent to stressed how thankful they were with my being so understanding of the whole situation. Throughout the entirety of this lengthy process the woman I was dealing with at the dealership rarely called me to let me know any update I was more often then not calling repeatedly to hear anything, I probably called the dealership 30 times and they called me of their own accord without my harassing at most 5. Disgusted with the company. I at one point was so tired that I called the state representative on Saturday November 21st, who said he would give me a call the following Monday regarding getting me a refund. I have yet to hear anything from him or anyone under him to this day. The only kind thing was the dealership from which I bought this car called a couple times to make sure the car was running fine after its return to me. Would never recommend to anyone!

fiat,500x,2016,Josh McNabb, 01/03/2016,Don't waste your time or money,1,"We were excited to be the first 500X owners in our town. We showed this car off to all our friends and family. A month after purchase, the car started shifting very firm and overheated. After going to the dealer, I was told that there was water in the oil ( telling me that a head was cracked or a seal was bad) we got the car back the next day and was told everything was fine. No notes on the paperwork about water being in the oil. Assuming everything was fine, we took the car back. A week later the car would stall during hard braking or hard acceleration. Today while picking my daughter up from a friends house, the car stalled and would not start for over 2 hours. No help from dealership on this matter as of yet. It could be our car, but after reading other reviews I don't think we're alone in this matter.

fiat,500x,2016,Disgruntled, 02/15/2018,Horrible experience,1,"At 24113 miles and less than 2 years old, vehicle began stalling after display or numerous different warning lights. Over the course of 7 months, I was left stranded 11 times after stalling on expressway and in town. Each time dealership replaced a part (5 new parts in total) and returned it to me ""fixed"". Warranty is for 5 years and I had extended warranty. Didn't want to trade. Wanted FIAT to fix it. They refused to buy back (it had over 24000 miles and not eligible?!), give be comparable vehicle, or acknowledge it was a lemon and they couldn't figure out the problem. Had to trade and take a financial loss as I couldn't continue to put my family in harm's way. FCA staff were not helpful. Entire experience with FIAT was horrible. Local dealership did as Chrysler/Fiat directed them and they actually stepped up to offer more on a trade they usual and took vehicle ""as-is"" which was still not repaired. I will never purchase another FIAT or recommend to others. Poor customer service and unwilling to accept responsibility for faulty vehicle.
"
fiat,500x,2016,Damzlfly, 07/08/2016,More than the sum of its parts,5,"The market for compact/subcompact crossovers is not crowded, but there are plenty of options. I researched Hondas, Mazdas, Nissans, Kias and Buicks (online, in-person, test driving) before deciding on a Fiat 500X. It was a difficult decision because I was looking for a previously owned vehicle, but 2016 is the first model year of the the 500X. After four months, I got lucky and found a discounted demo that was fully loaded and haven't looked back. The transmission is... quirky. It took me a couple of weeks to find the balance between hesitancy and jackrabbit starts. I had to actively be the one to decide because the car couldn't really do it (and still can't). Braking at low speeds is touchy - again, until one acclimates oneself to the system. Nonetheless, I am still thrilled by the nimbleness of the X. When I need to pass at highway speeds, I have to do little more than think it and it's done. The entertainment/communications/navigation/electronic control panel is everything it should be. The ride is firm, but real issues in the road (e.g., railroad tracks, speed bumps) are handled with alacrity. After a month, I still wake up thrilled to get behind the wheel. So much style, so much fun.

Update:
Our relationship is now celebrating its half-year anniversary, and we are still honeymooning. We have just experienced our first significant frozen precipitation event, and my baby sat it out in the driveway. I do not drive on ice. That is not why I bought the car. The X handles the narrow, twisting, hilly roads of my neighborhood with aplomb even in normal driving mode when there is no ice, and that is all that I ask.

One-year Update:
Now that I have owned the car for a year, I have to say that I did not appreciate the significant decline in value of the car. In one year, the value has declined by one-third. Otherwise, I'm still satisfied.

fiat,500x,2016,Ed the Fiat owner, 09/06/2018,"Great balance of luxury, safety and style",5,"Small crossovers are hot these days—they are easy to park, affordable, and packed with safety features including all-wheel-drive. To that combo, my Fiat 500x adds style and luxury touches. It's less popular than its Jeep Renegade twin, probably because Fiats are sold with other FCA brands. 2016 Trekking Plus models have slightly more aggressive styling with a satin chrome finish, and are fully loaded with excellent heated front seats (power on the driver's side), heated steering wheel, automatic A/C, fog + cornering lamps, UConnect infotainment with navigation and passive entry/pushbutton start. I am very pleased with the automatic headlights, speed sensitive wipers, dual-pane sunroof and safety equipment that came with the Tracking Plus Collection 2 package of options. The drivetrain is smooth and responsive. Parking is easy, thanks to the compact size and backup camera. The adjustable cargo floor is handy, though I prefer it in the upper position with some hidden storage underneath. Dislikes? It's a bit of a step to get in. Back seat legroom can be tight if front seats are pushed back for tall drivers. Gas mileage is merely average, but refueling is easy—no gas cap to remove. I rarely use remote start. Plastic door trim on all Fiats are easily scuffed. And the various safety alerts can be pretty loud. Annoyances aside, if you're not paying the depreciation, the 500x is a great choice for its standard features, practical size and attractive styling. Note that the 2019 tweaks removed out some options, so Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are in, and the heated steering wheel is out.

fiat,500x,2016,D. Winkler, 11/02/2015,The more-than-adequate compact crossover from Fiat,4,"This is a compact version of your average small American crossover, with enough horsepower, traction and capability to do almost everything you need it to do, and not a bit extra.  It won't tow your heavy equipment or move much of your furniture, but in Pop form, with the turbocharged multi-air four and six speed manual, it will get down the road nicely.  Put some good snow tires on its steel wheels and you will get where you are going through considerable snowfall.  The seats are comfortable, but rear seat passengers will be crowded.  Handling is really quite good, though my Fiat 500 Pop would run circles around it, and the 500X could easily be called ""quick,"" but not fast.  Note that the six speed manual makes all the difference in this model Fiat, though the option sacrifices you will have to make to row your own gears are substantial.  It seems that Fiat jumped on the manual-because-we-must bandwagon and the 1.4L 6MT is basic in most areas.  They saved the really good stuff for the Easy and Trekking versions.  No matter, the Pop 1.4L 6MT is a hoot to drive, has good road manners, decent acceleration with the turbocharger and a healthy lack of infotainment bells and whistles.  I do wish accessories were more reasonably priced and the 1.4L multi-air engine didn't eat premium gas, but there is much to like and no complaints so far.  Still no complaints after 4750 miles.  Dealership fixed a cruise control issue under warranty, and while it did take a while, they gave me a loaner (500L).  Did my own oil change recently and it's much easier than my Fiat 500 Pop.  Still like the car after six months!

UPDATE:  After nine months of ownership the Fiat 500X was involved in a car/deer collision, sustained substantial damage to the front, and was a total loss.  The airbags worked as designed, though the knee airbag left a palm sized bruise on my right leg and the passenger airbag (seat was unoccupied) broke the windshield.  Lost substantial money to depreciation, though my insurance company was completely transparent and efficient throughout.  I replaced the Fiat 500X with a 2014 Ford C-Max Energi that I like very much.

UPDATE:  After four years of ownership I traded my Fiat 500 in on the Ford C-Max above and now have zero Fiats in my garage.  I am living happily ever after.  Would I buy another Fiat?  No.  FCA will always be the quirky Italian cousin everyone talks about, but nobody takes seriously.  That is a shame.

UPDATE:  I am still Fiat free and a used Fiat 500 Pop 6M is a rare vehicle indeed.  Still doesn't command much of a price on the used market, but is very difficult to find.  No plans to add a Fiat to my garage, but coveting a new Ford Ranger or Bronco.

UPDATE:  The algorithm does not understand why I have not updated my review of a car(s) I have not owned in years, so this is an ""update"" of sorts.  Fiat 500X in the  manual configuration has become a unicorn in the used car market and just about impossible to find.  Fiat's days in the USA are numbered, I'm afraid, but there is nothing to be done about that in an insane locked down world, where the inmates are running the asylum.  Fasten your seat belt, it's going to get rough out there..

UPDATE: Fall 2020.  The algorithm still does not know that I no longer own any Fiats and even the Ford CMax has been sold to a Ford dealer (for trade-in value).  The state decided PHEVs were not paying enough gas tax and bumped the tag fee much higher, so I got inspired and no longer own the CMax PHEV.  I am pleased with my Ford Focus, 6M ecoboost three cylinder sedan, though the 2020 Ford Edge Titanium 2.0L may replace it next summer, because its 8-speed automatic and larger size are attractive..

fiat,500x,2016,kim, 09/02/2015,The 500X never stops disappointing,1,"Its been about 6 months with my 500X and there's not a day that goes by that I regret the decision to buy it.
I had a few problems once I first bought the car and was received poorly at my Fiat agency and Fiat USA. Ther was never any acknowledgement of the problems (shiftiness, tire screeching, electronic malfunction), instead they just assured me everything was ok. Well it's month six and those problems, sans the electronic, are still there. Add a horrible, annoying and constant rattling from both doors and that's what I put up with daily. 
I regret not buying a Mazda or Honda.

fiat,500x,2016,Nic S, 02/09/2017,Love this car more than any I've ever owned,5,"I am 58 years old with a chronic pain condition. I was getting pain in my hip and back because my old car was not ergonomic and I had started a new job that gave me a longer commute. I'm  a very practical person so I've stuck with Hondas and Toyotas most of my life. I decided to look for a new car, and my top concern was a comfortable, power adjustable seat. I test drove Honda, Toyota, VW, and Chevy.  Just for yucks I thought I'd stop by the Fiat dealer, which I passed every day on my way home.   The 500 was adorable but uncomfortable for me. The salesman suggested I look at the 500x and when I test drove it, it was the most comfortable seat I ever tried.  I had such a bias in my mind against Fiat that I didn't bother to discuss numbers, and went my merry way to try more Hondas, Toyotas, etc.  I couldn't get it out of my mind how comfortable the Fiat was, and I loved the look so I went back for a 2nd test drive. Sure enough, still the most comfy seat I had tried.  Turned out to be right in my price range. I've had it 2 months and still love it. Back pain is much better.  Everybody comments on my car and says they love it. A couple of drawbacks, though. When weather and engine are cold, acceleration is very sluggish.  Solution is to use remote start while walking to car, and let it run a couple of minutes before driving, but that does cut into mpg. Also, auto transmission upshifts at 2000 RPM instead of 2500, and hovers around 1500.  Sometimes it feels like engine is lugging, though it has never stalled.  I can live with those issues, all things considered. I think Fiat markets to young people but they should think about marketing to seniors, as this car is extremely easy to get in and out of, is not too low or high.  So many of the Hondas, Toyotas, etc. are downright UGLY this year with huge black grills and weird angles that make them look like a monster.  It's nice to have a car that's stylish and meets my practical needs at the same time.  I thought I hated driving because of my back pain. Now I love to drive.  Freeway mpg as high as 36 with no traffic.

fiat,500x,2016,joy, 09/24/2019,faulty electronics,1,"Extremely upset with this car!  Faulty electronics.  As I am driving, in the rain, the electronics will go haywire, air bags disable, power steering disabled, can barely get it to stop.  It will either shut off or will not let me shut off.  I have had it in the shop so many times and it still not fixed.  I was on a very busy road when this last time happened. Do I have to die before something is done??
"
fiat,500x,2016,Tb0325, 02/08/2020,Don’t do it!,2,"This was the newest vehicle I’d ever purchased(purchased 2017). When I test drove it, I was concerned about the obvious lag when shifting from 1st to 2nd(it’s an automatic but can manually shift if driver chooses). The dealer convinced me it was because I was used to a 6 cylinder(Chevy impala) and the Fiat was a 4. So I rush purchased...only to be disappointed! Turns out the lag is because it’s a 9 speed. I still can’t stand the lag when shifting gears. But there was MORE to come. Within a few months the plastic, poorly manufactured drivers door handle snapped OFF, causing me to have to enter through the passenger side AND half of the gas tank entry(idk what it’s called) snapped off as well. Luckily those were covered by my 1 year warranty. Following that, I’ve had nothing but problems that I’m assuming are electrical or a problem w transmission. I’d have to downshift going uphill in order for the rpms to catch(I’m not a car expert so I hope that makes sense). That happened SEVERAL times after being fixed several times. I’d also get alerts “drive mode unavailable” continuously which terrified me while going 80 on the highway! But the car continued to drive. It IS a tiny vehicle, although aesthetically pleasing(I don’t think so but I’ve had a lot of compliments). And I do HAVE to say after all my complaints, it’s a beast in the snow with its AWD. Never got stuck even when there was a foot of snow. Not so much as a slide. Personally I’d consider an American model of vehicle, which I’m in the process of hunting now.  The dealer convinced me that the Fiat is American since Chrysler makes it but I had to drive 1.5 hours away to get serviced? It’s possible I just got a lemon and these vehicles are great but buyer beware! "
fiat,500x,2016,Roberto Notarantonio , 03/01/2020,Great value,4,"Any car ,or make will have issues. My Fiat 500x 2016 manual transmission is great.  Anything with moving parts will have issues  ,no matter what car company you choose. There are many factors involved to rate a car. How the car is being used and driven. The maintenance, and how many people drive it. My Fiat has 35000 kilometers on it and it's bin a great vehicle with minimal issues.  Fun to drive good on fuel, and comfortable. My trim is 500X 1.4 lt trekking manual. Not listed in trim option Thank you Fiat!

fiat,500x,2016,Bbrink24, 03/12/2020,2016 500x bought feb. 2020,5,"Disclaimer I've only had this car for 1 month. This review will get monthy updates on cost to own. As in gas and repairs, of any sort. It is a 2016 with 41,000 miles and no wrecks listed on car fax. Also coming from a 32 year old who's single. Bought for $12,000 dollars.

So far I love this car. It's the trekking model. With a lot of the upgrades like, heated steering wheel and remote start, cornering lamps, rear blind spot monitoring. Plus my favorite the beats by Dre subwoofer sound system. Which is plenty good enough to last me a couple months to a year to install a set of 12' subwoofers ( if you listen to rap or hard rock music). Otherwise I don't recommend.

Positives
Plenty of space for what I need. Can fit $200 bucks of groceries in the back. But your not fitting your girlfriends big wooden dresser even with back seats folded down. My nieces and nephews can ride 5 deep in it. I'd say front seats 6'2 and smaller plenty of room. And back seats 6'0 and down.

I get looks and questions all the time. I live in Western PA so no one has this car. I literally haven't seen one since I bought it. I've started conversations with women over this car. A current girl I'm dating. So ya positive. 

My comfort level inside is definitely 5 of 5.
My first week of driving it. We had a snow storm. It dashed right through 4"" of snow no problem. It is all wheel drive tho. With a traction, eco and sports modes.

The exterior and interior. Look and feel great. For the price it's hard to find all the luxuries you can get on this car. 

Considering all the negative marks the so called experts gave. It's power and handling are quite a bit better the I thought it would be. At 185 hp it has peep. And no problems driving 90 on a highway. Or getting up to higher speeds I've had no issue.

Flaws(so far)

Of which I can only say two. The cvt 9 speed transmission. Is a bit jerky in low gears. I've never had a cvt before. But it's different to get used to. I'm guessing it's about fuel economy. It has slap shift and a sports mode. That make it a lot more fun to drive.

In this category of car. It's on the lower end of mpg. On curvy back roads and city. I've gotten about 26 mpg. On the highway I've been looking at a better 30 mpg. Overall totally fine for me. But there is better if you fancy that at the top of your list.

Overview

If your a guy like me. Who fancies looks, sound systems, something unique, and affordable. Don't hesitate to buy this car!! There's a lot said about Fiat. But even Honda and Toyota made crappy cars in past decades. And until this car proves me wrong. I'm going to be plenty Happy with this transaction! Like I said updates incoming hopefully monthly"
fiat,500x,2016,Robert JF, 06/21/2016,"This would be a good car, if it had a good engine!",3,"The 500X is a nice little SUV, with many fine attributes.  Unfortunately, it is hobbled by a sluggish engine and transmission.  The engine and transmission look impressive on paper, with 180 HP and 9 speeds.  But, they fail to deliver.  My rental, with only 8000 miles on it, had a bad tendency to hesitate at the worst possible times. Even when the hesitating was not pronounced, there was a noticeable delay between pressing the gas pedal and the car moving.  The engine has no torque below 2500 RPM.   I experimented with manual shifting and then flooring the accelerator. Below 2500, the engine was weak. Passing situations, where you may be at 45 MPH and want to move in the passing lane with traffic rapidly approaching from the rear, were unnerving.  It seems like an eternity before the transmission downshifts, and the engine builds enough torque to accelerate the car.  The Sport mode works by holding the RPM's about 1000 higher, but it did not improve the performance much.  Generally, the acceleration was either ""too little"", or ""too much"", and rarely ""just right"".  I tried moderately accelerating, but the transmission quickly goes into a higher gear, making the accelerating sluggish.  Trying to accelerate only slightly faster resulted in abrupt downshifts, and the engine racing towards its red line.  This gives other drivers the impression that you are trying to race them, when you are only trying to get reasonable acceleration out of it. An auto magazine found that the smaller engine and manual transmission was actually faster than the larger engine and automatic.  This does not surprise me. Other reviews have mentioned the balky transmission, so I don't believe that my car was an isolated case.  I am not sure about the hesitation. that is unusual in a modern car.  Driving in mountainous areas was a chore, and manual shifting worked best.   But there is little engine braking below 4000 RPM, so going down 8 percent grades was a noisy affair. I will leave the other details about the car to other reviewers.  First, see if you are going to be happy with the engine and transmission, and then look at the rest of the car's features.
"
fiat,500x,2016,John, 12/04/2016,"Mostly good, but some serious issues.",4,"There are many things I love about this car, but I want to focus on the reasons why I am slightly regretting my purchase. The first is the terrible road noise at freeway speed, it's not bad if you have the radio on. But if you are talking to a passenger it can be a bit annoying, and taking a call on the Bluetooth system, don't even bother while going down the freeway because the person on the other line will just tell you that there is too much background noise to hear well. As for safety, I was really happy at the ratings it received. Unfortunately because of the pillar side airbags being so chunky, it leaves way too much blind area not just while making turns but can leave a pedestrian invisible at the pillar as you approach. To correct this I have to constantly move my head left and right to see around the pillar. I've never experienced so many close calls in any other car. And if you do have to break hard, get ready to veer left or right (that's part of the surprise, you don't get to know which direction it will take you). Even if you hold the steering wheel perfectly straight while moderately or heavily breaking you will veer sharply and there is nothing you can do to prevent it. Then we have the transmittion, it does not matter if it is in auto or semi-auto, it lags something terrible. Sometimes when you slow down and then begin to accelerate, it can take up to three seconds to react and downshift for any power at all. 4th and 5th gear changes are always clunky and late, leaving you to lurch about. If you are in auto and briefly (as in less than a seconds worth) press hard on the gas, it will down shift into second regardless of speed and take nearly half a minute to get back to the proper gear. This leaves you looking like a proper knob who is trying to race other drivers while you are at maximum revs. The final issue I have is that a warning light came on for the fab to be serviced (owning the car for only seven months). The dealership said that it needs an update and they would contact me in another month if it is available by then. In the meantime I get a pinging warning when I open the car door, start the car (which leaves a warning in place of the speed for 30 seconds annoyingly), when I turn off the car and again when I open my door to get out. And I have to deal with this obnoxious feature for at lease a month while they work on an update. I can't fanthom why in the world this is an issue in the first place.

fiat,500x,2016,Aimee Gomez, 08/03/2016,Unfortunate issues,3,"I owned the Fiat 500 L, which was totalled, and I walked away from the crash, so for that, I was thankful. I had many issues with my car, but for the price and accessories, I considered the 500 X. I had it as my rental car. It already had issues with only 4000 miles on it. The engine was hiccup ping already and some back up camera issues were already there. I had to have my backup camera replaced at 15000 miles and had already changed my brakes at 20000.

fiat,500x,2016,Tracey, 11/01/2017,Avoid this car!,2,"I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this car.  I was so excited to get it.  It looks cool and has a lot of nice features, but quality-wise, it is very poor.  Road noise is excessive, I am on my 3rd sunroof so far in the first year due to it being loose and rocking and rattling in the roof.  I am on my 2nd air conditioner unit due to it smelling like mold.  I think water somehow gets into the system and molds in there, so when it is turned on, it smells like mold/mildew.  It is a fun car to drive, but the seats are pretty hard, so it is terrible for long road trips.  My old van was so much more comfortable.  I tried to get the lemon law on this car but Chrysler basically denied any problems.  I have had this car in the dealer at least 2 1/2 months of the time I've had it.  Too bad I bought it rather than leased it.  Now I am stuck with this lemon.  I would stay far far away from this car and Chrysler in general-they are the worst!

fiat,500x,2016,Ahr Kyaw, 07/15/2016,Manual Makes it Better!!!,5,"Ok...so I had an Abarth...Manual...w 5 speed. But we're having a child soon so I had to trade in w 500x Manual. It comes with 6 speed. Boy ...it shifts better. Smooth.  Often I missed my Abarth Exhaust notes. But I'm  starting to like this 500x because even though it's the same engine, 6 speed is a lot better for both cars. Clutch is really easy to shift...it is never a chores. I was never a Fiat fun till now. Big Trunk, lots of room interior and driver seat is also comfy. I wish they put CD player. Man i miss it too. Saves gas also even though it runs premium but hey if put 70mph on cruise, you'll get like 32mpg at least. So yes..if you want manual, roomy, big trunk this is the one for you.

I took it to the dealership many times. The last thing that did was to stop in the middle of the highway. When I brought it for service. Guess what had happened? the clutch BURNED. BURNED!!!! YES. Brand new car and the clutch burned. I freaked out in the middle of the highway. I had to get out and the next day I took it immediately to Rick Case FIAT. They had to give me a rental because the car was unsafe to drive. Well.. maybe I should've thought about it more carefully, but I loved the look of the FIAT so much that I decided to get a new FIAT instead. Because the other one ... well you know what happened. The clutch BURNED. So I decided to lease a 500X thinking it was a ""much better"" version of the old one and thinking this one was not going to have any problems at all. Well....WRONG! I leased this car on September of 2015. I had taken this car about 5-6 times already. The last 3 times for the same exact reason. The car is simply unsafe to drive. I do not feel safe in that car. I am scared of driving it and for something bad to happen to me. I will NEVER purchase a FIAT EVER again. I am so disappointed, upset, and simply can't believe how awful my experience has been with FIAT.

After having a car for less than 6 weeks the car completely shut off on the interstate. The brake locked car would not start. Take it to the dealership dealership has a minute to diagnose it. They tried to say it was an electrical problem. And truth I don't think they know. Now they're saying the engine has locked up. No problems with car until I had an oil change. If I were you I would not get this car. This car needs to be recalled. It is a safety hazard to anyone and their family. It will shut off at high speeds. Will not start and horrible weather. What's even worse is Chrysler will not own up to the fact that this is not a great car this car is deadly. I almost lost my life. Sat in 90 degree weather until a tow truck came to get me and the car. Was not even offered a rental car. Please do yourself a favor and do not get this car.

fiat,500x,2016,Greg Logan, 12/25/2018,Small crossover that thinks its a small car,4,"After my wife's 500c was wrecked we looked until we found an absolutely loaded 500x. The car doesnt have a ton of power but the 2.4 revs high and mated to the decent 9 speed auto it makes it a lot of fun to drive. The steering is pretty numb but you can whip this car around pretty good. The handling of the car is good for being a but top heavy. The gas mileage isn't out of this world maybe average at best. The interior is nice front seats are comfortable and supportive and the controls are well placed and easy to use. The car is an absolute blast in the snow. Turn off ESC and put it in sport mode for a lot of fun. I'd reccomend it to anyone looking for a small suv/crossover that stands out. Deffinatly a lot of Italian flair.

fiat,500x,2016,tharris1, 03/09/2019,It’s an OK car,1,"Bought a 2016 500x Easy with only 40k miles on it. Shifting is really rough, especially with those first few gears, like throw your head back into the seat kind of rough. Also rough downshifting when braking. Other than that, the car was awesome. Cute, spacious, and very up to date with technology. I unfortunately returned it to the dealer because I had a 2013 Ford Focus before the Fiat and it had horrible transmission problems so I was too paranoid with the Fiats hard shifting and didn’t want it to become a problem later down the road. I hear there’s a software patch for the shifting but I also hear it only makes it more bearable and doesn’t fix the problem entirely. Not saying it’s a bad car but do your research!

fiat,500x,2016,TE, 06/12/2017,Love at first sit,4,"I bought my FIAT 500x Lounge gently used. I was actually in the dealership to look at the Jeep Renegade, but the specific one I had come in to see had sold.  I noticed the FIAT and asked if I could test drive it. It was love at first sit. I have a bad neck and back, and it is hard for me to comfortable in a vehicle. The 500x is hands down the most comfortable seat I have encountered. The sporty look, quality of the trim and awesome sound system are just icing on the cake for me.  I will agree that the transmission is a bit 'confused' at times. However, I have learned to drive it so it shifts quite smoothly. It just takes some getting used to.  It rides incredibly smoothly on the freeway. Not the quietest car I have ever driven, but also not the loudest. The road noise is perceivable but not distracting. Overall the FIAT 500x Lounge offers a smooth, solid and sturdy ride with great visibility and plentiful features. I love my FIAT!

So much has needed replacement under the warranty and now they were 2000 miles off of the warranty our field dealership is saying the drivetrain needs to be completely replaced. Plus they should also come into account when thinking about buying an Fiat There’s not many mechanics can service them because of where their parts come, and they’re more of a specialty car. So expect to only go to your Fiat dealership wherever the nearest one might be to you. We’ve owned this car for just over a year and we’ve been to the fiat dealership 7 times to fix various issues.

fiat,500x,2017,Robert DiGia, 06/26/2017,If you are tired of the same old same old....,5,"I have owned over 65 vehicle in my lifetime, and this 500X hits a sweet spot between form and function. It has that either love it or hate it styling ..which I love...the driving experience with the manual 6 speed and turbo 1.4 gives that sense of control and feel for the road that seems missing in most of the made for the masses CUV's out there...its refreshing to be engaged with the driving experience instead being a slave to the computer controlled automatic transmissions that make a mad dash for the highest ratio gearing no matter what speed you are driving. I guess I am one of the 4% ers that still like to row their own gears in this style of vehicle.                   The great part of this vehicle is that it has a 4 year/50K bumper to bumper warranty for a car that is priced with incentives at $15K .  Add to that fact, that the car is well executed in its fit and finish with better quality materials than what would be found on higher grade trim levels from other manufacturers you can drive away from the dealership confident that you are not feeling car poor and still are driving a car that might arouse some envy from onlookers. ......time will tell if the thrill of commanding a fun to drive stylish CUV will fade, but I suspect given the choice of driving my RAV4 limited or the 500X in my driveway I will grab the keys to the FIAT....she is just so much more fun!

I have had the car a year now.... still love driving it. The 4cyl Turbo with the 6 speed is in my opinion the better of the two drivetrains. Unfortunately a buyer cannot option the AWD system with this drivetrain arrangement. FIAT only offers a 4wd with their Jeep Renegade that uses the same platform as the 500x with the turbo and manual setup. I knew that when I bought the car and looked at the Jeep... but the suspension tuning and styling pushed me to the 500x ... I have an AWD vehicle so it wasn’t a big deal to forego the option in the FIAT... so far very pleased... lots of compliments on the car from onlookers at gas stations and parking lots...

fiat,500x,2017,Shawn J, 03/04/2017,Impressive SUV! Worth every penny.,5,"I moved into the 500x Trekking AWD from my 2013 FIAT Abarth. I really really liked my Abarth but absolutely love my new 500x! I have some physical disabilities and the Abarth was while very fun to drive also hard for me to drive and was starting to find that people just do not see you in that small of a vehicle. Looking for comfort, and size over the Abarth and the high quality of a precision Italian SUV boy did I find it! The new interior of the 500x Trekking is amazing and the technology in the features blew me away! It may take me a month to learn how to use everything this SUV has to offer. Styling is great and the optional 18"" wheel package and AWD I got adds even more tremendous styling. Acceleration is so so but then again I'm coming from the Abarth. Fuel economy is also not real fantastic but still pretty reasonable. Overall I have zero complaints on this SUV. The one serious recommendation I have though is, get either the Trekking AWD or Lounge AWD model. I test drove the Pop and Easy FWD models and they do not even compare. All the bells and whistles with the two higher models are 100% worth it!

fiat,500x,2017,motoraway, 02/05/2017,500xcellent! Even better after one year.,5,"I'm a little biased to the Fiat brand having owned a 128 Sport Coupe in the 70's and currently a 2012 500 Abarth. The 500x was something I wanted but had to do a little arm twisting to get my wife on board. We traded her Jeep Wrangler Sport in and I believe we were both happy to say goodbye to what was probably the most uncomfortable vehicle we've owned. We've sacrificed a little space moving into the 500x but aside from that we really love this vehicle. The ride is really comfortable, handling is precise, acceleration is adequate and it's a treat to drive. That's one thing about my Fiats that set them apart from all the other vehicles we've owned. Plain and simple, they are fun to drive!

fiat,500x,2017,JT, 02/22/2018,Best Car I've Ever Owned....,5,"I've been extremely happy with this car. Ride is excellent. Quite and smooth. Great gas mileage!!! Great power!!! Fantastic Handling!!! I feel like I'm driving a sports car. I'm glad the computer has a setting to notify you regarding your speed.  I have mine set for 10 miles above the limit and it is always notifying me as you don't realize how fast you are going.  You can't feel it shifting except when you first start out as it is a little hesitant.  The interior rivals cars that are much costlier. The materials used and fit and finish are excellent.  My biggest gripe is Fiat needs to market this car through their Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler dealers and service them their as well or at worst case scenario require Alfa/Maserati dealers to service at least under warranty. I live in a fairly large metropolitan city and I have to drive 60 to 75 miles to the closet dealer for warranty work. I only wish I drove more but I work out of my house......

fiat,500x,2017,Ron Lakes, 10/04/2017,"Well made, enjoyable to drive",5,"My wife and I really love our 500X. It's our second Fiat (we continue to own a 2014 500L). Needless to say, if we've bought a second one, then we must be pretty pleased with our first one (we are!). We purchased our 500X with all the bells and whistles (AWD, safety suite (lane departure warning, lane keep assist, auto emergency braking, back up camera and park assist), leather interior). Our 500X feels very solid over bumps, dips and road imperfections, no squeaks or rattles whatsoever. The 9 Speed transmission is often criticized, but for the most part we're fine with it. It tries to get up into the tallest gear as soon as it can when in normal (when mode selector is in default ""Auto"" mode). I wish it had a 4th mode where it still wanted to shift up to as high a gear as possible for fuel economy, but was more willing to downshift without having to really stop on the accelerator (as is the case in the ""Auto"" mode)- a mode somewhere between ""Auto"" and ""Sport"". The 3rd mode is ""Traction+"", which has you pulling away from a stop in 2nd rather than 1st, plus it engages AWD regardless of whether a wheel is slipping or not, as well as a less aggressive accelerator pedal programming. So far no problems, though our 500L has become my commuter car so the 500X doesn't get driven so much. The suspension provides for a very good ride on the whole, though I'd say I slightly prefer the ride of our 500L a bit (it's wheel base is nearly 2 inches longer, and the lower ground clearance makes for a little bit less bouncy-ness due to less suspension travel).  The fuel economy could be better- I hope FCA is working on a direct injection version of the 2.4 liter 4 cylinder, or perhaps a new engine entirely. Personally I think the 1.4 liter turbo is the superior engine, but to opt for that in the 500X requires that you accept shifting your own gears via 6 speed manual transmission. I will say the 2.4 liter does well enough in suburban driving, especially if you're lucky on the signal lights, as I've seen better than 35 mpg on occasion. I notice that sales figures have the Jeep Renegade outselling the 500X by about 10:1, but I much prefer the X over the Jeep- how it looks and how it drives, even though they are on essentially the same platform. Finally, the 2018's will have Apple Car Play and Android Auto with FCA's latest Uconnect entertainment suite.

fiat,500x,2017,Robert Caswell, 08/16/2018,not too bad for the price,4,"bought our car dec’17 . had 35 miles on it . the thing drives like a dream . we had a historic snow storm here and this little car , which i did not think would do as good . i was going past full size 4wd trucks and suv’s like nothing . it was a tank . 

now roughly 9 months later has about 5700 miles now . had the car into the dealer roughly 5 x for key fob problems . replaced fobs and later entire system and have done others things to make it work proper . still have problems bit kinda gave up on it . the button pads on steering wheel are pretty loose . have little problems here and there but getting fixed . 

the ride is great . very smooth on virtually any type road . steering is responsive . cannot mash the gas and expect to get moving quick . yes it does have a bit of engine and tranny noises but this is expected as well for this class of car .

seats are actually not bad . stiff but cushy at same time . back seat is big enough for a hundred pound dog . and she loves it . good amount of cargo room . if you look at the car it seems small but really it is bigger on the inside . 

milage is about 22mpg around 29mpg hiway . 

for the price of our fiat it is pretty good overall . the big problems are the electronics . the style is real nice inside and outside . if i was asked to get another fiat , well about 50/50 . 

my wife loves it . we are in the city . which is great . it is zippy and that is great for city driving .

fiat,500x,2017,St. John, 02/13/2019,Turbo with 6 speed Manual = Abarth motor,5,"This 2017 500x is a great vehicle, my second Fiat.  I wanted a 6 speed manual with turbo (limited to less than 5% of all 500x cars imported to US).  It is a practical Italian sports car that has a strong engine, fantastic handling and great ride quality. Highway mileage is 33 mpg and city is 25 mpg.  Unfortunately, all options were not available with this Pop configuration, ie sunroof and leather interior, but did include back-up camera, Sirius radio, bluetooth, touch screen, etc.  The combination of the Abarth motor together with the 6 speed make this car very enjoyable to drive for short commutes or long distance travel.  Incentives made it an even better value.  Full 50,000 mile or 4 year warranty is excellent.  Don’t hesitate to purchase a Fiat, they offer outstanding reliability, and a very connected driver experience you won’t get with the competition.
Update 8/20/20:
I now have nearly 28k on the odometer and my review of this incredible vehicle has not changed.  It is one of the best cars I have owned and I have owned many.  I put on 17"" Sparco rims with larger profile Continental tires for a little more height.  Still handles perfectly. I also installed an Ulter performance exhaust and K & N air filter. I use this vehicle daily in addition to a CL55 AMG that I have.  With the back seat down, the available storage is huge. The front passenger seat folds forward for extra long items.  No service issues whatsoever.  Manual shift is no longer available in the US.  Great, great vehicle and value.  Sorry for Fiat that sales are weak in America.  World sales have been leading the market segment.

fiat,500x,2017,Dissappointed, 03/01/2018,"Had the car about a year, already very disappointe",2,"Decided to lease the vehicle in December of 2016, the car had engine lights come on and had to be towed within 24hrs of getting it home, I was told there was a bad sensor in my side view mirror. About 2 months later, I was driving with my kids on the highway and a “drive mode unavailable” warning came on. I was left stranded on the highway with 2 small children in a new car. They came and towed it, I never got a clear answer for the problem. I told them to check the transmission, which they said was “fine”. They returned the car to me with the warning light off over a week later with the transmission worse than ever. It is not fine, the jerking that occurs from the stop position to first gear is horrible, it is like driving in a manual trasmission car with someone learning how to shift. I have a neck injury, and some days driving this car is like torture. I have owned other Chrysler family vehicles in the past with no issues, I never dreamed I would be this disappointed. I travel for work and drive rental cars three weeks a month, and I don’t see this problem with other manufacturers. Also, don’t expect help from ANY other dealerships in the Chrysler family of you are having troubles, they like to defer you to only Fiat dealerships which are few and far between.

fiat,500x,2017,paul A Indelicato, 01/23/2019,MY NIGHTMARE,1,"Make sure when it spends time in the shop (WHICH IS OFTEN) the STEALERSHIP gives you the same car to drive not a billboard to advertise for them. I purchased a NEW 2017 FIAT 500x Trekking car on 01/17/2019 from Peake Chrysler in Sodus NY 14551. By  01/21/2019 the FIAT is at the dealership with no heat... They ordered a part for 01/22/2019 replaced it and it’s still not working right, now they tell me they have to order another part which is due in on 01/23/2019 and their not sure that’s going to work. What to do ??? I'm about to take the plates off it and bring back the key and tell them to keep it... The car has 349 miles on it and so far it’s been at the STEALERSHIP as long as I’ve owned it....

fiat,500x,2017,David, 05/18/2019,Finally a car I can hang on to!!,4,"To start off, I'm 33 years old and have owned around 20 cars. The longest I've kept one is about a year and a half even when it was a brand or model I was really into. I started doing research on the 500x and decided I really wanted one as it offered everything I desired in a car for not a ton of money and it was packed full of character. I was a little concerned due to the reviews of the 9 speed transmission and the overall stigma surrounding Fiat. My experience has been nothing but positive. In one year of ownership I've put over 17k miles on this car and it hasn't given me any issues. I have the Trekking AWD with every option available including the active safety features. The forward crash mitigation has saved my bacon twice and everything else seems to work pretty well. I've taken the car off road, dealt with stop and go traffic in the dead of summer and long highway commutes and this car stays strong, remains comfortable and does exactly what I need it to without hesitation. The AWD system performs well off road and in the snow. PROS: Far more reliable than people will lead you to believe, comfortable, decent stereo, PACKED full of fun and personality, great interior material quality. CONS: Some build quality issues (feels kind of 'snapped' together instead of one cohesive piece like Japanese cars have), there's occasionally a bit too much vibration at idle, The armrest on the driver's door is too low to comfortably use when driving, infotainment occasionally freezes but is easily reset, MPG should be better but I am getting better than the sticker claims. All in all, I would recommend this car to anyone, I *adore* it. I'm constantly amazing that companies like Land Rover, VW and Ford can pump out cars that are known to be reliability nightmares but people will go in droves to buy them but Fiat has a bad reputation when it seems they're no worse than a typical car.

fiat,500x,2017,Karen, 05/23/2020,It was fun while it lasted.,4,"I loved my Fiat 500x Trekking car. I had it for nearly three years but a deer met its fate and totaled the car. 

This car was fun and zippy. Parking was a breeze, gas mileage was awesome, reliable, and nice ride. 

The bad part as the car does not hold it’s value. I recently got a new car but not another Fiat. It was fun while it lasted.

fiat,500x,2017,Dr Tasso Pappas, 09/19/2018,Not bad for the money-it’s great! Dr Tasso Pappas.,5,"We had the pleasure of moving to a metro area. We’ve had many suburbans in Tahoe’s and larger SUVs. Including Jeep grand Cherokee’s. We love those vehicles. But I love the fear. In one of the worst blizzards I’ve seen in the Midwest the Fiat 500 X handled better than anything else I’ve ever driven except a Subaru outback. The interstate was closed 20 minutes after I went down at passing vehicle safely. I’ve never felt more solid in the vehicle. It’s like a cute jellybean with all wheel drive. The front seats are incredibly comfortable and luxurious. However, there’s minimal legroom in the   Backseat. The finish is nice and the steering wheel is incredibly comfortable. The motor is a little week for acceleration but does the job in the city. It’s it’s much higher than you think. Compared to its sibling the jeep renegade it’s a much more luxurious and cute car with greater personality. The ride is better due to the difference in suspensions. Because usually get about five to $7000 off the sticker price it’s a great value. I’ll buy another one again once they offer  adaptive cruise control

fiat,500x,2017,Bravo1, 07/27/2019,Best safety features,5,"My 2017 Fiat 500x lounge with 14000 miles. It has been a good reliable car with no issues, it looks great and i love the safety features offered to the driver.  Other manufactures advertise  the forward collision avoidance system but fail to give the details, some work up to 19mph and some only start above 37 mph where fiat gives you up to full speed, and i have read it in the owners manual,  be aware most car salesmen have no idea on the numbers and just tell you that it has it. Overall fun car to drive and its been reliable.

fiat,500x,2018,PaulW, 04/21/2018,Hot,4,"What I love. Well just look at the car! So stylish. I had been driving a 2013 Subaru Crosstrek. I love that this is even a little more compact and that there are so few on the road. Performance probably not as good.  Subaru AWD can't be beat, and the Subaru flat 4 has a lower center of gravity. Ground clearance on the 500X is same as Crosstrek, very good. Seats ride higher on the 500X even though the heights of the vehicles are the same, so better road visibility. 5'11"" or taller is a problem in the back if you have the moonroof. Acceleration is about the same (Fiat has more HP but more weight). Gas mileage  (25 combined) is one less than the Crosstrek. Cabin noise is much better in the 500X. Rear visibility better in the 500X (I had to remove the rear headrests in the Crosstrek). Professional reviews complain about the 9-speed struggling to find the right gear, I haven't noticed a thing. Most importantly, did I mention how hot this thing is? Ow! Love it! (Cons: no cargo cover (though it's only a small gap between the back seats and the trunk), auto dim mirror on top model only, limited Fiat accessories, gas mileage should be better.)

fiat,500x,2019,Terry M, 05/24/2019,Fantastico!,5,"Rented a Fiat 500X for a two week vacation in Europe and was awed by its performance. My wife and I were also impressed with the automobile's comfort, maneuverability, peppiness and display gadgets such as ""driver assist"" which posted the speed limit on rural roads along with many other features. I am not sure what are mpg was using diesel fuel, but the car's consumption seemed average for an automatic transmission. My American preconceived perception of Fiat has totally changed..I am impressed.     "
fiat,500x,2019,A Hoopes, 04/27/2020,Great four season Commuter Car so far,4,"I was looking for a car to get back and forth from work and to run errands with and this car fits the bill. Since we are now empty nesters, I don't need a large car to transport my son's teams hockey equipment anymore so my needs were a 4 cylinder (Turbo's a plus) car with a high clearance and all wheel drive. Since the 500x is built on the Jeep Renegade frame and possessed those features, we decided to test drive the Trekking model. I'm 6 feet tall and had no problem fitting behind the wheel but the second row is a tight fit for long drives. When you drop the second seats down, you have plenty of room for cargo. The dash layout is ergonomic and not too complicated and although the touch screen is a little on the small side, I am adjusting to it over time. The motor is a 177hp, 4 cylinder turbo that is the largest in it's class so it has more than enough acceleration to handle commuting traffic. So far the drawbacks I've noticed have been the gas tank capacity (<13 gallons) and the high octane recommended although I've just lately have been filling up with 89 octane and so far haven't noticed any lag. Another issue is the bells and beeps the driver assist throws at you. I'm working on the default settings to see if I can tone them down. So... all and all I've been very happy with the selection we've made. I'll try to update this review as we more into the hot then colder (snowy) seasons.

fiat,500x,2019,ChuckFL, 04/24/2020,Very happy with this car.,5,"I have a 2019 500X in the Trekking trim. It is a comfortable car, and the new 1.3 turbo gives you a class leading 210 lb-ft of torque at just 2200 RPM. In normal mode it is peppy enough. Put it in sport mode and it really goes. I have no complaints about the power of this car and the handling. I see a lot of people complain about the transmission. Well, in normal mode it tries to hold down the revs so you achieve better mileage. If your like me, just leave it in sport mode and you get good crisp shifts at higher revs and the car comes alive. People notice it, too. I am often asked how it drives and if I like it and I say I definitely enjoy the ride! I came from a Dodge Challenger when I finally realized I needed the safety of all wheel drive and the cargo space. Is it as fast as a Challenger? Of course not!  Buy a hemi if you want acceleration. If you want a fun, peppy, satisfying car to drive everyday, you cannot go wrong with the 500X.

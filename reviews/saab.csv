saab,9-2x,2005,matthewakamatt, 11/25/2014,180k and still love it,4,"The Saabaru is a great blend of sportiness, reliability, and practicality.  It's sporty and powerful enough to stay entertaining for years.  I really enjoy the on boost power, but there's not much low end torque.  Handling is good enough for the street, but it's not really at home on the racetrack.

Mine is still completely stock, and has been incredibly reliable.  I've got almost 180k miles on it, and have only had a few repairs in all that time.

I really like how practical it is.  I frequently load lots of stuff in the back and tow a 5x8 utility trailer with it for household projects."
saab,9-2x,2005,ScottB, 10/30/2005,Su-baab,4,"I would have bought the Impreza wagon but, the seats were too narrow.  However, the Saab Leather seats are slightly wider, much more comfortable.   What astounds me about this car is the fuel mileage.  I drive pretty quickly in town, and get 29-30.  On the highway, I get up to 34 mpg.  Wow."
saab,9-2x,2005,waveho, 04/17/2009,Long-term ownership review,4,"Wife bought the 05 9-2x Linear, with cold weather package (heated seats, windows, leather, etc.) at the end of 2004 to be used exclusively as her primary vehicle in her pharma sales job, which requires a LOT of driving.  About 180,000(!) miles later, its Subaru quality is still shining through.  In all this time, it's only required new tires and brakes at regular intervals. This is a car that is driven often in the back roads of central Virginia and the Appalachia area of West Virginia. It's always burned a bit of oil, and the fog lights have had to be replaced due to sand and rocks thrown from trucks during the winter.  This is a quality car, fun to drive (5-spd).  Highly recommend."
saab,9-2x,2005,estevanker, 12/11/2009,100k Problem-Free Miles!,4,I've been driving this car 150 miles daily to work and back and have not had a single issue with it. The car averages 33mpg and is awesome in the snow and ice. I anticipate driving it another 100k miles.
saab,9-2x,2005,mrdragon016, 04/08/2011,Good First Car,4,"I bought My Saabaru a couple weeks back and everytime i drive it, it brings a huge smile on my face. Its got plenty of kick and can turn on a dime. with a 4 banger as well as AWD its a amazing little car"
saab,9-2x,2005,David, 08/09/2005,9-2X,4,"The 9-2x is not an Audi quattro, or an Evo, or an STi. But it doesn't have the price tag of those other AWD performance cars. What it does have is the basics that the WRX gives you, minus some of the WRX's boy racer bug-eyed-ness, plus a little swedish minimalism along with a superior warranty and maintenance program - for a few thousand dollars less than a new WRX invoice! Of course, I'm talking post-GM employee discount pricing where the numbers went south of $20K. No car is without fault, but this one suits my daily driving demands (both rationally and emotionally) better than any vehicle I've driven in the last 10 years."
saab,9-2x,2005,double75, 04/26/2012,Keeps on ticking!.,4,"I have a 2005 Saab 92x Linear Automatic. I bought it way back when they had the GM employee discount for everybody. So I bought it instead of the Subaru Impreza.the mileage is over 266,000 miles and she keeps on ticking. I makes sure she is dealer tuned every year and I change the oil every 5,000 miles. I've had the rear struts changed. Right as I type this i have her in the shop. I busted three Lug Studs on the left driver rear hub while driving. While i was checking the proper torque on the other lugs, I busted another stud on the front left hub. The dealer busted two studs about two months ago on the back right rear tire during service. The car has been good to me and my family. "
saab,9-2x,2005,Scott, 09/22/2009,"Practical, Reliable, Rally-Bred Monster",4,"Last year I went used shopping for a practical AWD compact for city use and occasional road trips. To my surprise, this turbo Saabaru (which, yes, has an automatic) was the best of the lot by far. Plodding around in town it's as docile as any other auto-compact, yet the turbo means it doesn't run out of steam on the highway (I'm looking at you, SX4/Fit). But it's not all practicality: being a WRX, it's ready to play whenever. Put the tach above 3500 and it hisses, growls, and rips a hole in time. Show it some curves and it annihilates them (it's front heavy, but there's so much grip it almost doesn't matter). Best of all, you can go back to driving casually once you're done abusing the tarmac."
saab,9-2x,2005,amie, 11/09/2008,Great car,4,"I have been slamming the miles on this car which now has 151,000. I have had no problems other than replacing the tires. The paint on the hood  peeled and Saab finally agreed to re paint the hood.  It is a fast car and I get a lot of compliments on it. It still looks new when I clean it up.  Would do it all over again"
saab,9-2x,2005,Rippen Griffin, 02/25/2009,Rippen Griffen 9-2X Aero,4,"Best car I have ever owned! Plenty of interior room for a small family, and the rear seats fold flat for more hauling room.  Super reliable - over 108k miles, and no service repairs!  My car has been modified, to produce ~100 hp over stock hp, and is still a reliable daily driver."
saab,9-2x,2005,Eclem, 05/04/2005,Impreza Owner Goes Saab 9-2 Linear MS,5,"I bought the 9-2 Linear manual shift BECAUSE it was built by Fuji Heavy Industries who builds Subaru Imprezas. I've owned 2 Imprezas and they are the best car I know of if you need a tool to go in all conditions and have fun. With rebates the 9-2 cost same as a comparable Impreza, but much better looking, much quiet, more precise handling, side airs, cruise, sun-roof, heated seats, mirror and wiper defrosters ... most stuff not available on Impreza. Add in the far superior warranty and free service and loaners ... had to go with the Saab."
saab,9-2x,2005,jmelaw, 06/02/2005,A Much Better WRX (and better looking),4,"Loved the idea of the WRX wagon, but couldn't get past the ugliness of the thing--the bug-eyed look wasn't for me.  What I hoped for was a decent horsepower, better-looking, but similar sized AWD mini-wagon.  Found it--the Saab-icized WRX--or, as I desribed it to everyone, a better WRX---quieter, better looking, better interior, but with the same great 230hp AWD chassis (and reliability) that Subaru is famous for.  Really like the car--few nits are some early rattles (to be covered under warranty), but overall, a blast to drive.  Love that you don't see one every 10ft.  Easy to add 30hp with chip reprogram.  A stealth mini-missile, with upscale badging.  Gotta love it!"
saab,9-2x,2005,Alisa, 09/15/2005,Saab 9-2X Fun!,4,"I love my Saab 9-2x so much that I have actually tried to convince others to buy it, too! The car has handled well in every situation I've tried it in, I'm hoping it will remain just as good in the snow this winter. It is sporty, yet still a ""luxury"" car if that makes any sense at all. I wasn't looking for any frills, just a good, solid car. I did, however, end up getting the cold weather package so I have heated windshield wipers and outer mirrors... I can't wait til it is cold enough to use them! This car was in HIGH demand when I bought it this summer, so I'll live with the upgrade. :) I have never owned a Saab before... after owning this car I would gladly go back! "
saab,9-2x,2005,LCACBOSN, 01/05/2006,Sleeper,3,Overall this automobile is an excellent value. It's definitely Subaru however the added Saab soundproofing and ride quality makes a huge difference. The front-end sheet medal appearance is better than the 05 Impreza.  I recently drove the car north from Virginia to New Hampshire in late December. I found that driving in all snow conditions to be safe and pleasurable. The dry weather performance is fantastic for a grocery getter. 
saab,9-2x,2005,L. Zeitlin, 04/20/2006,Resolving a midlife crisis,4,"This is a ""Q"" boat of a car. It packages the firebreathing performance of the Subaru WRX in a skin that you would not be reluctant to drive to a meeting at the Harvard Club. I can recapture the sports car days of my youth yet remain outwardly respectable. The build quality is excellent and the car has proven ultimately reliable. Fuel economy is good but every time you use the blazing acceleration, it's like throwing a 50 cent piece out the window."
saab,9-2x,2005,Chad, 06/22/2005,Great car and value,4,"We just purchased our 9-2x Aero and have been extremely satisfied. We purchased under GM's Employee Discount promotion for approx. $8000 below MSRP. Thus, we have a premium label, upgraded stereo, climate control, etc.,arguably better looks and handling with the same engine performance and reliability as the WRX, all for $1000s less. Many articles have been written about the car's performance, so I'll just say it is very quick and has excellent handling. The AWD is a useful feature on the slick Seattle streets. Up until the promotion I was set on a sedan (Legacy GT or TSX), but the value was too good to pass up and now I have to admit I really like the styling and driving something unique. "
saab,9-2x,2005,Jim, 10/05/2005,Saabaru Wagon,4,"Got this car for company trips.  So far it has been good.  Decent cargo room, nice leather interior, xenon headlights are great.  Not a performance car by any means but will get you from point A to B while letting you have a good amount of fun with the 5sp."
saab,9-2x,2005,gerry davis, 08/07/2006,Saab 9-2x,3,"The interior is very plain and understated, very few bells or whistles. The seats are very tight fitting, almost like race seats. This is a good feature when cornering hard as you don't slide in the seat at all. For those who are somewhat ample in the posteror region they might be uncomfortable.  The seat fabric is very very prone to coffee stains, Saab could have thought this out better.  My guess is that the demographic who buys this car also drinks a lot of coffee.  The car is fun to drive with ample horse power and great handling. The awd is awesome in snow."
saab,9-2x,2005,ownone, 10/05/2004,Great euro wagon,5,"Very fun car, great value for the 
price. SAAB did a lot of work on this 
car. I have owned the car for about two 
months and am still learning features 
on this car. From little cubbie holes 
here and there to the larger issues 
like saftey, this car seems to be very 
well thought out.

So far I love the car and have a ton of 
interest in car whereever I travel in 
CA."
saab,9-2x,2005,Sarah MacKinnon, 02/14/2008,2005 Saab 9-2x,4,"My husband and I love this car; the seats adjust well and vision is good for both of us as drivers (he is 6'2"" and I'm 5'2"").  For the basic car, this is well equipped with front and rear air bags, ABS and moonroof.  The car is fun to drive, handles extremely well and is superb in winter driving (which we get in Nova Scotia).  "
saab,9-2x,2005,Mike Ruby, 12/10/2004,New Saab... Same 'ol Story,4,"I leased my Saab 9-2X in October 2004.  Besides the acceleration being a little weak... this is a fun ride weaving in and out of traffic or going out on the highway.  Unfortunately my fun came to an abrupt end when I was in an accident, and had to start dealing with ""Saab the Manufacturer"".  My Saab has been stuck in the body shop since November 1st... today is December 10th; that's 40 DAYS!  From trying to acquire a parts/pricing list, to ordering the parts, there have been nothing but delays.  Did I forget to mention my airbag DID NOT DEPLOY? I have yet to hear a response from Saab  with my concerns regarding the airbag.  The 40 day wait, that will end up at 50; Saab contends this is normal."
saab,9-2x,2005,Red9-2X, 04/09/2005,So Far...,4,"I have owned my 9-2X for 3-1/2 months and so far I'm generally pleased with my selection of the Saab 9-2X as my daily driver. It's a refined fusion of Euro-Style & Japanese AWD Technology. I am pleased with it's functional side as well as it's sporty/fun side. I like knowing that I have several safety features working for me with Side curtain and front airbags, ABS & 4 wheel disk brakes, AWD for slippery road conditions, and the Xenon driving lamps. I also feel secure with the great warranty offered. I really like the cargo capacity. The split fold down rear seats are vesatile feature. I would recommend this car for anyone whose functional criteria match up to what this car offers."
saab,9-2x,2005,b_thunder, 04/30/2005,"Improved WRX, more affordable than WRX",4,"It's a great wagon - speed, handling, AWD traction and cargo space in one classy package.  And a lot of fun to drive. It does suffer from turbo lag and has average at best fuel economy. Nevertheless, this car (IMHO) not only looks better that WRX, but it is overall a better car. Considering current GM rebates and other discounts, it can be had for a lot less than 2005 WRX wagon which makes 9-2x Aero an excellent value."
saab,9-2x,2005,dean-arammalamma, 05/29/2005,Wheeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!,4,"I traded in my Mazda Protege 5 for the 9-2x Aero a week ago, and haven't looked back. I was a bit concerned that I would miss the handling of the Mazda, but a week in the new car has put that worry aside! I absolutely love the handling of the all wheel drive, and the kick from the turbo is just a blast! It's like my Mazda and my old 98 Vette combined. Now I ask ya, can you get any better that that?? :-)"
saab,9-2x,2005,JPC, 06/10/2005,Fun car at the right price,3,"After owning a Nissan Xterra (and dealing with its appetite for fuel), I was in the market for a more economical vehicle at or around $16K.  My choices were limited, and I had started to resign myself to purchasing a Toyota Corolla.  Thanks to the current GM rebates, the Saab 9-2X Linear was in my price range.  The car has a distinctly Saab look in the front, Subaru look in the midsecton, and Saab again in the rear.  There is a world of difference in the ride quality between the related Subaru Impreza 2.5s & the Saab 9-2X linear.  The spring rates in the Saab are not as harsh as in the Subaru.  The styling of the Saab is more mature.  Saab also made many safety features standard. "
saab,9-2x,2005,Oolon Coluphid, 06/23/2005,I Love My Saaburu,4,This car is so much fun to drive that my wife and I regularly fight over the keys.
saab,9-2x,2005,Pat, 06/15/2005,I'd be mad if I paid full price,3,"But I spent $8500 off msrp, which makes me very happy. I paid less than my friends WRX. I really don't think it's any more quiet.  It's more jarring over ruff pavement (17""?). Automatic is horrible. Aggressive driving is scary because of the automatic. The cloth is better, but gets dirty really fast.  The seats don't seem to keep you in place as well. Oddly enough I love my car. Normal driving is pleasant. Side by side looks much better than the WRX. I have an AWD wagon with lots of safety for cheap. Only wish I got a stick, at least until I'm stuck in traffic."
saab,9-2x,2005,newatsaab, 06/24/2005,Nice Car,4,"Bought this car due to GM and Saab discounts.  Fun to drive, mileage on city/hwy 25 to 33 mpg. Accelerates smoothly, handles well, brakes well. Cruise control maintains speed well. Plenty of room in front and back seats for moderately sized people. Paid $18,500 for linear with automatic and cold weather package. Suprised at good mileage for an all wheel drive vehicle.  Would recommend based on limited experience, with available discounts.  Seats split and fold flat without having to raise back seat.  Can sit a person in one side of back seat and fold down other side. Good all around visibility from drivers seat."
saab,9-2x,2005,JD94, 06/24/2005,Revenge of the Nerd,4,"Remember freshman year of high school, when the nerdiest, scrawniest kid from junior high walked into homeroom, huge with a mustache? That's what this car reminds me of. At first glance, it looks like a harmless suby impreza wagon, look again, it's a wrx, one more peak, is that a saab? The 92x is a great car. It is fun to drive, handles well in all climates, it can get decent gas mileage, and if pushed, can accelerate like a fighter jet. I was trying to explain what it looked like to a coworker, and the first thing that came to my mind was, my car is Mini Me on steroids. But in reality, it is built like a pug and runs like a greyhound."
saab,9-2x,2005,Chris Mackey, 07/07/2005,Sweet car even for a guy in his late 30s,4,"Love the looks of this car.   The rear hatch opens up and fits 6 bags of groceries easily.  Automatic Aero off of the line is very slow until the turbo kicks in.  Makes up for that as you accelerate from 35 MPH to 75MPH in a hurry.  Suspension is perfect for me.  Not too tight, but still corners like a stud.  The stereo is merely adequate.  Meets the needs of most people.  Its clear Saab expects you to upgrade the system."
saab,9-2x,2005,FrankFromCT, 07/09/2005,Beware of the 9-2x's out there.,3,"I bought a new 9-2x with GM's employee discount, thinking it would be a steal, but my experience has been unpleasant and I've only had the car for 3 weeks. Since a lot of these cars have been sitting on the lots for a year, my car had flat spots in the tires and scratches all over it from just sitting. My selling dealer has left me out in the cold, completely blowing me off and leaving me with a vehicle that's in poor condition. During the time of my purchase, I wasn't able to inspect or drive the exact vehicle and instead offered a demo to evaluate. I never thought my new vehicle would be in such bad condition although brand new. Buyers beware of the condition, inspect  before you purchase."
saab,9-2x,2005,Stewy, 07/10/2005,I'm really loving my new SAAB!,4,"I ended up going with the Linear because I have a 35 mile drive to work everyday and the Areo's turbo power means a max of 25 mpg and premium fuel -  the Linear takes regular and gets 30mpg.  I'm not disappointed though - this car is a lot of fun to drive.  The Linear has plenty of power , the styling is great and even though I've been told other Saab 93 and 95 owners may turn there noses up at the 9-2x's Subaru heritage - I'm re-assured that this car was built on a solid platform from a car company noted for reliability. "
saab,9-2x,2005,Dave, 07/22/2005,"Fun car has practical side, too",5,"This is the most fun-to-drive car I've owned.  I am also very pleased to be getting just about 30mpg in these days of gas around $2.50/gal.  Also, the $5000 rebate on top of employee pricing was unexpectedly generous. I'm very happy I bought this car!  I feel 10 years younger."
saab,9-2x,2005,beemboy, 07/28/2005,Beauty for the beast,4,"Anyone up for a Subaru entree with Saab spices? I was, and it's delicious! The 9-2x Aero combines the practicality of a wagon (great for carting small- to medium-sized dogs, for example, or camping gear), the thrills of a turbo engine (it will put a silly grin on your face that you cannot wipe off), and the safety of all-wheel-drive with ABS and a limited slip differential. The turbo characteristics have been refined, so you won't necessarily take off like a Tasmanian devil at 3000RPM. The shifter is notchy and can definitely be improved. Seats are decent, and the two-tone interior is nice. Road noise is acceptable, but more than the Jetta I owned. In all, a practical car that spells F-U-N."
saab,9-2x,2005,John B, 07/26/2005,Nice Car,4,"I would never pay full price for this, but with the incentives, it was impossible to resist--I paid $20,600 for a $28K car.  (I got every option except the automatic.)  Interior is a bit cheap and there was a paint flaw.  (Don't ever get black paint!)   But it is a fun car to drive."
saab,9-2x,2005,Sir DriveAlot, 08/12/2005,Great Little All Wheel Driver,4,"Overall this is a very competent car. I traded in my pick-up truck for an automatic Linear so I could save gas $$. So far I get around 27-28 mpg combined city and highway. This is the most stylish, inexpensive, and most efficient vehicle I could find that would get me up my steep driveway in the winter. The rear folding seats are versatile enough to handle my child seat and whatever other general items I need to haul. Acceleration is adequate, but I am not speed racer. Excellent price with the latest sdeals from GM/Saab."
saab,9-2x,2005,Anand, 08/12/2005,Good for the discount price,4,"For the $20k or so that an Aero is going for now with the discounts, you won't find a more capable car.  It is not the prettiest car, inside or out, but everything is well laid out and functional.  "
saab,9-2x,2005,Mike, 08/13/2005,Great car for the city,4,"I think its a great car for the city.  Easy to drive and get into tight parking spaces.  I love the handling and enjoy the AWD.  Only taken it on one longer trip, and was an great to drive on windy mountain roads, although the seats are the most comfortable long term.  I like that's is markedly different than the subaru, which are way too common in northern virginia."
saab,9-2x,2005,Suub, 08/28/2005,Best Value in 5-door sport compact,4,"This 5-door Saab/Suub/Saabaru (pick your poison) is a step up from the great Impreza WRX wagon. More precise and comfortable handling, better body design, increased noise reduction, and overall better good looks differentiate this vehicle greatly from the Subaru. It's price is a bit on the steep side, but it's worth every penny. If the performance isn't quite up to snuff, you can always add aftermarket power toys to blow away the competition! I love this car, and I've owned and test-driven several 5- doors. This is by far the best of the bunch! Too bad they're practically sold out of the '05s. Buy an '06--you won't regret it!"
saab,9-2x,2005,92xaero, 09/27/2005,Excellent deal for the money,4,"Picked up my Aero 5mt early July, 2005 and have already put about 4400 miles on it. The car is a lot of fun to drive and a bargain for the less than $20k that I paid. Engine pulls strongly above 3000rpm and puts a smile on my face every time. Shifter is a little notchy but is getting  better with use. Lower gears are spaced a little too far apart which needs them to be revved higher before upshifts for max performance. Interior is spartan by Saab standards, but quite adequate at its price point. Huge selection of WRX aftermarket bolt-on/tuning parts make it very easy to upgrade power and handling at reasonable prices. All in all, an excellent ride at a very affordable price!"
saab,9-2x,2005,jon, 10/09/2005,Fun drive no goofy styling,5,"The 9-2x is a Subaru Impreza we all know that. However, it shares components from the WRX a cult followed vehicle for its fun drive and good performance. The Saab offers the same features as the best WRX on all models of the 9-2x. The syling is much improved over the Subaru especial the 2.5 sport model of the the outback or whatever. With discounts from dealers it is not to much more then the subaru but is much better in fit and finish in small details. A better performer then the Impreza. Equal to the WRX if you opt for the turbo and a nice in between if you get the linear. "
saab,9-2x,2005,KJReynolds, 08/16/2005,Saabaru NOT at it's Finest,2,"Having owned 4 previous Saabs, this Saab is not their best by any means - nor is it up to Saab standards. I ""downtraded"" my Saab 9.5 Linear to save $150 on monthly car note - definelty not worth it! I drive 100 mi/day tho it is mostly highway driving. I feel every road bump - road noise - engine noise - not a comfy car by any means. I'm getting worse gas mileage, 25mpg (is a 5 speed) compared to 30 on the 9.5 - and it's a very small fuel tank annoys me to fill up every 3-4 days. I've never driven a Subaru - but I think this car is a Saab in a Halloween costume. I just hope it ends up being as reliable as my others - it better make up for the lack of comfort."
saab,9-2x,2005,Russ, 09/20/2005,Just O.K.,1,"First of all I'm a 21 year old college student. Its a black Aero with Cold & premium pkgs. I got this car myself it's my 1st car and couldn't wait to get it. With the employee pricing it was hard to pass up. But to that I add I should've gotten the new ""06"" Civc this car feels very questionable in the quality department. It's very slow off the line you have to practically floor it at every light to get it going which cancelled out the fuel efficiency of the 4cyl that it has as opposed to the ""06"" v6 eclipse i wanted it's the same MPG. The steering is said to be direct aka ""Not enough power steering boost"". I don't how Saab even thought this car would sell for 30k !!!  "
saab,9-2x,2005,HK, 10/14/2008,Great all-rounder,4,"I just finished a 5 day drive from Michigan to Alberta in this vehicle, and I would do it again, no hesitation. The car performed admirably, as it has always done. It's been great in the snow (though I thought it was better the first winter;I expect the new tires will help), always reliable, and looks a lot better than the Subaru. The car's  Achilles heel is the 4 speed auto transmission. It feels unrefined, and brings the average down a bit. I hoped for better fuel economy (20 city, 26 hwy), and replaced the very weak factory stereo. But over all, it's a great car which I intend to keep for a long time."
saab,9-2x,2005,dssquare85, 03/05/2012,Eleanor will be missed...,4,"I purchased my Aero used with 30,000K on her. I immediately fell in love and still miss her to this day.

I had Eleanor for almost 3 years. She gave me no problems and put nothing but smiles on my face while I owned her. It was worth the expensive insurance, premium fuel and lackluster mpg.

Unfortunately, the engine decided to blow at 57,000K with regularly scheduled maintenance. Thousands of dollars later it just wasn't the same and was forced to trade her in.

I gave Subaru another chance and traded Eleanor in for '11 Legacy in May 2011."
saab,9-2x,2005,Jay Kanabar, 12/26/2008,Like it so far,5,Excellent car. I have a 9-3 as well and compared with that I feel that the steering and control is far superior. 
saab,9-2x,2005,RLW, 12/30/2007,Just a car,2,"the 2005 Saab Linear is fairly reliable and provides good gas mileage. However this car provides little if any driving enjoyment.  I drive 35,000 miles annually and it didn't take long for the negative details of this car to outweigh the positive.  The sound system is poor at best, the interior materials are low end economy car quality (I know if is an Impreza, but still) and the ride is noisy (yes, I have tried different tires).  These elements coupled with a low fun to drive quotient strikes the Saab off of my future purchase list."
saab,9-2x,2005,BOOGEX, 09/12/2009,Practical,4,"I bought this car for the combination of practical features- safe, good fuel economy, AWD, decent performance, reliability.  Overall, I like it, but I'm not sure if I'd do it all over again.  I'm 6'2"" and find the car to be extremely uncomfortable on longer trips.  It's also a tight squeeze as a family car- if you have child seats, they don't fit easily.  It's also not an easy drive in heavy traffic- I have a manual trans. and the shifting is kind of a pain compared to other manuals I've driven. I'd go with an automatic over a manual if I were buying again.  The few flaws aside, it's a fun car to drive for the money.  "
saab,9-2x,2005,rkymtnhgh, 02/05/2010,Saabaru,4,"You get everything you expect from a Subaru with some extra creature comforts and Saab style.  The AWD is fantastic in inclement weather and handling and highway ride is impressive.  My chief complaint is the performance of the automatic transmission.  It tends to be sluggish around town and slow to kick down, especially from third gear.  Family requirements necessitated an automatic, but I'd recommend the 5spd manual.   Overall build quality is good, but the exterior paint chips easily and some of the interior materials could stand improvement.  Two tone fabric looks slick, but stains show readily.  Rear seat leg room is limited, so adult passengers may be uncomfortable on longer trips."
saab,9-2x,2005,chills23, 06/15/2005,9-2x Aer-Ohhhhh!!!,4,"What a steal! Quick, nimble, stylish, handles well, reliable, roomy, & solid.  Everything the WRX is and wishes it could be.  Price is better than a WRX, ride is better, interior is much nicer, exterior sleeker (WRX is fugly IMHO). Handles better and is faster than my former mod'd Audi A4 and costs 30% less.  Never thought the car would turn heads, but in Brilliant Red, the car is intimidating and striking.  There isn't a car out there that can compare at this price range.  Being an avid car mag reader, enthusiast, and motorcycle rider I can honestly tell you this is the car deal of a lifetime if you seek performance, reliability, and all weather utility in an affordable but stylish package."
saab,9-2x,2005,Derek, 10/28/2005,Nice Car,4,If you are looking for something practical but fun the 9-2x is a good choice.  I am 23 and very active in basketball and baseball and the 9-2x can fit all my gear plus a few friends.  Also I plan on owning this car for a long time so it is nice to know I can grow into it as well.
saab,9-2x,2005,nigel, 11/07/2005,Excellent small wagon,4,"Acquired a 9-2X Linear with cold weather package & moon roof for the same price as a Subaru Impresza OB SE (GM empoyee discount). Excellent handling, with a firm but not harsh ride; nice 2-tone interior and very supportive seats; lots of trunk room and great fuel economy (~29MPG)"
saab,9-2x,2005,Paul, 12/14/2005,Saabaru?,5,"Nice car.  Drives nice, roomy, comfortable, AWD, economical, and great price.  Good warranty and it is a Subaru (Subaru, known for its reliability, made the car -base on Impreza- GM worked on quieter and upscale interior look.) Many people asked me what kind of car was it and if I ordered it from Europe"
saab,9-2x,2005,jvo, 12/30/2005,the perfect AWD sport wagon,4,"After driving this car for about 4000 miles I absolutely love it.  The AWD is excellent in South Florida rain and I've found the usable cargo space to be near that of my previous 96 4runner.  After about a 1200 mile breakin period I've notice a significant improvement in gas mileage to around 27 mpg (combined city/highway).  The seats were supportive and comfortable on the numerous 3-4 hour trips I've taken.  Perhaps the best attributes of this car are the combination of Japanese reliability, European luxury service, and GM employee pricing.  I repeatedly get inquiries and compliments on my unique car."
saab,9-2x,2005,Lisa, 01/03/2006,Performance,5,"I bought my Saab 1/2005. It is my 3rd Saab.  This wagon has been terrific in bad weather conditions such as snow, ice, and rain.  I have driven it to Tahoe on many occasions and it has been very steady and easy to handle.  The winter package has been a plus.  The wagon is getting about 28 mpg as I mostly drive it freeway.  Occasionally I am getting 29-30 - but I have a rack on and that does affect this.  So far, I have been very pleased and found that with all the sports I do, it has made a great work/sport car without being a gas hog.   "
saab,9-2x,2005,KGS, 01/05/2006,Linear review,4,"Good car.  Great deal for the money but only with rebate.  OUTSTANDING cargo space.  Actually beats the Mitsubishi Outlander, it's still AWD, had leather AND stick.  Baltimore to Cape Cod mileage: 31.8 MPG.  This includes going 10 miles in 2-1/2 hours on the Jersey Turnpike.  Went up/down Whiteface Mountain with ease.  Fun to drive. Heated seats are a plus."
saab,9-2x,2005,jbg, 01/19/2006,saabaru,4,"a great car that, with the GM incentives, was less money than the Subaru that it copies.  plus it is much better looking - the nose-job makes a BIG difference - and you get Saab's service. interior a bit stark, but a good value for the money when you consider the all wheel drive.  if getting the 2.5, be SURE to get manual - auto is VERY sluggish.  Love that saab once again has a hatch-back."
saab,9-2x,2005,Aaron Clow, 02/07/2006,Rockin' Pocket Rocket,4,"As soon as I found out Subaru was making a Saab, I had to have one. Subaru reliability + saab styling/tuning have lived up to promise. Zero issues in 15000 miles so far. I always felt safe, even going out in the heavy snows last winter here in NY. Love the sound of the flat-4 with the windows down."
saab,9-2x,2005,Jm94, 08/19/2006,14 Months of Ownership,4,"I had the Silver Bullet for 14 months before I traded it in. The 92x is a very fun car to drive. On an open winding road, I can't imagine a better vehicle. It also handles extremely well in the rain. Every day use though is a different story. In stop and go traffic, it beats you up. I took a 5 hour road trip and found that it performed much better on the highway than I expected, but by hour 4, my back, shoulders and neck hurt so much I couldn't wait. Turbolag is poor, slow off the line, from 30-70 in 3rd gear, it's an F16, arguably one of the fastest cars on the road. Bottom line, this car is like driving a race car. What it lacks in comfort, it makes up for in fun. "

this is a WRX in other clothing?  Have a
look at the Subaru Imprezza Wagon.

Coincidence that Saab releases a 2.0L,
awd *boxer* engine turbocharged wagon
made in Japan?

The WRX is great, but how is this a SAAB?"

the 2.5 Linear and am extremely pleased 
with the Saab 92X. Was considering 
waiting for the AWD Audi A3 or BMW 
Series-1, but am happy I decided to go 
with the Saab. The handling and 
performance is superb.
Highly recommend to anyone considering 
a AWD sports wagon.  "
saab,9-2x,2005,new92xowner, 08/06/2004,Drive it...,4,"I read many reviews about the 9-2x prior to 
purchase.  The best thing I can tell you is that if you 
are considering this against a Subaru-drive both 
and then decide.  There is no comparison.  Ride 
quality, sound levels, safety features are well worth 
the price.  Is it a real Saab?  My Nissan Xterra was 
made by a Japanese company with a French 
majority in Smyrna Tennessee.  My inlaws PT cruiser 
was produced in Mexico by an American company 
owned by a German one.  Automaking is a global 
enterprise.  GM took a great car and made it better.  
What's to complain about?"

handles like a dream, corners VERY 
well, has plenty of pep, and is very 
comfortable. After doing a lot of 
shopping, I believe this car offers a 
whole lot of value for the money, and I 
know I made a great choice. The 9-2X 
makes driving a whole lot of fun, and I 
have lots of room to bring along 
friends and my dogs, too!"
saab,9-2x,2005,vkr, 08/10/2004,Saab 92X AWD,5,"Remember that the 92X is an all time 
AWD so dont compare this to a FWD. Its 
the best, affordable AWD in the market. 
For more pep choose the aero for 4000$ 
more than the linear."
saab,9-2x,2005,Karen Katanick, 08/15/2004,Blind spot,4,"This is a great driving car. The only 
complaint I have is the blind spot on 
the drivers side. I was taught to 
glance over my shoulder before merging 
to the left but in this vehicle the 
view is obstructed. Compared to my last 
car, a 2001 VW Beetle, the Saab is much 
more comfortable and handles really 
well. I am anxious to drive it in 
snow.  "

rebadged Subaru with a little Saab 
improvement (sound deadening, etc.). 
The exterior is unmistakable for the 
WRX Wagon and the interior is Subaru, 
through and through, with chaep 
plastic everywhere. I was very 
disappointed at the lack of power 
seats, steering wheel stereo controls, 
etc. The car has to be punished to get 
all of the 227 HP out of it and it 
does have a lot of body roll, though 
less than the WRX. The only reason to 
justify spending more money on this 
car than the WRX wagon is the upscale 
Saab name and a little tighter 
suspension. Other than that, save a 
couple grand and buy the WRX wagon. "
saab,9-2x,2005,SatistifiedDude, 08/26/2004,Excellent car for a reasonable price,5,"Saab traditionists should take a test 
drive on this wonderful car, and it'll 
for sure change their mind.  This car 
is considerably better than an Impreza 
wagon in looks, interior, ride 
quality, and built.  Get in the car, 
and you'll love it.  With incentives 
etc, you can get a fully loaded Linear 
for 26k...what a BARGAIN, imo."

saab,9-2x,2005,92xsergio, 10/11/2004,Not impressed...,2,"I thought that buying a new 9-2X would
be better than my other choice the V50.
 I'm starting to think the other way
around especially since the interior
quality isnt that great.  The sun visors
are slightly loose and the center
armrest console is too.  I still like
the car, but theres better choices out
there and too bad I had to find out the
hard way."
saab,9-2x,2005,Awdride, 10/21/2004,Y not WRX,4,"This is a great car but for alot less
you can find a nice cheap used WRX wagon

bought car...Only 200 miles so far...It 
is a Subaru underneath...So what!!! Who 
can go wrong with the AWD system from 
Subaru...Saab has made this car more 
comfortable and quiet as far as ride is 
concerned and you can't beat the 
4yr/50000 mile standard warranty as 
well as 2yr/24000 included scheduled 
maintenance...and don't forget a free 
loaner car whenever you take your car 
in for service...This car is a blast to

Subaru and you decide...I did it and it 
was no contest..."
saab,9-2x,2005,TheKid, 12/16/2004,It's worth the extra 3K,4,"Many reviews of this car focus on 
whether or not it is truly a Saab.  
That's a shame since the car should be 
judged for what it is and not if it is 
a Saab. Also, these professional auto 
reviewers never point out that real 
Saabs, speciafically the 9-3 are not 
the most reliable cars. Subarus are 
very reliable. That said the WRX is a 
great car and the extra 3K for a 9-2X 
provide you with- longer warranty, 
upgraded exterior and interior, 
optional features not available on the 
WRX (leather, heated mirrors and 
seats), addtional sound deadening for 
a quieter ride, and a much better 
dealer experience.  Current rebates 
make the base list price equal to the 
WRX. No toll ticket clip?  Who cares?"
saab,9-2x,2005,Dennis, 01/17/2005,Excellent Saab!,4,"I have had my Saab 9-2X for four monthsnow and it has 6,000 miles.  I haven'thad a single problem with it and enjoy driving it more every day.  Mine is the non-turbocharged Linear but I find there is plenty of power.  It is an automatic with the upgraded interior - leather,heated seats, great sound system.  Sure it's a Subaru underneath but that will only maximize it's longevity and Saab did a great job with the exterior and interior design.  I highly recommend this car!"
saab,9-2x,2005,Anne, 01/28/2005,Sweet little thing,4,"This is my first car, and i could not have asked for a better one. I never have to worry about it breaking down and that little 2.5 liter engine gets me where i want where i want to go on about 27mpg. It is great in corners and never looses hold of the road. Also it is so pretty to look at...sigh...the only problem i have with it is that the non-turbo model has that typical subaru lag in 2nd gear.  Also in really bad snow, like 6 inches on the road, turns can be tricky, but it does great everywhere else. All in all, i love this car! Test drive it!!"
saab,9-2x,2005,SharonSAABophile, 02/22/2005,A Car for All Seasons,4,"Even though it's a Subaru underneath, SAAB has made it look great, classier than the Subaru equivalent, and the handling and performance in this snowy New England winter has been a gift from the gods. The versatility and flexibityof the sport wagon style is a great asset since SAAB no longer makes hatchbacks. The warranty and scheduled maintenance program is excellent in this price class. Beats the Subaru. People may call it a ""Saabaru"".  The 9-2X is fun to drive, powerful,safe, smooth and a terrific value."
saab,9-2x,2005,Bob908, 03/09/2005,Take it or leave it,4,"We all know this car is a rebadged WRX. That said Saab has made this car more of a ""luxury"" car then a ""race"" car with sound dampening, slightly less stiff suspension, and i believe they took the steering components from the STI. The automatic turbo version of this car does not feel as spirited as its manual counterpart.  The thing I am most impressed with is the AWD and the lack of body roll when turning partially due to the Horizontally opposed motor (IMO, 2/3's of a porsche's motor).  I love my car and think it is an excellent option to consider besides an SUV."
saab,9-2x,2005,Love2Drive, 03/19/2005,A Very Good Premium Compact,4,"This is a quality entry in the premium compact class. First, identify what you want. If you love driving, have a preference for European cars or European styling, and don't want to spend a fortune, you have come to the right place. This car has been tastefully upgraded by SAAB, and is not really a competitor to the Subaru WRX, but a new entry in what is expected to be a rapidly growing category...the premium compact class. Think a fast Audi, with comparable handling, but at a base level Audi price. You will likely not find even the upcoming Audi A3 at this price, with this performance. This car offers very good performance and handling, huge utility, good looks, at a reasonable price."
saab,9-2x,2005,KK, 03/23/2005,I love my Saab 92X except it takes premi,4,The 92X is zippy and handles well in all weather conditions. The mileage could be better...I get 21 miles to a gallon of premium gas - Highway driving. I didn't know it took premium until after I paid for the upgraded turbo car. Originally I was going to buy the less expensive model.) My dealership did not explain the covered service features to me until after I had the vehicle serviced for the first time and had to pay for the oil change.
saab,9-2x,2005,Photoguy, 04/07/2005,Great Sportswagon,4,I got the auto transmission Aero even though I heard that you need the manual Tranny to get good performance.(My wife doesn't like to drive manual transmissions) I have been pleasantly surprised with the performance with the auto- if your engine rpm is less than 3000 and you  downshift to third gear before hitting the accelerator it will kick down to second gear and move out fast.Cornering and steering are exceptionally good on this car!
saab,9-2x,2005,nomore92x, 05/11/2005,92x--The worst car I've ever owned,2,"I'm leasing this car for two years.  Ever since I got it, my arms, hands, shoulders, neck and back have been killing me.  i finally figured out that it was the really hard seat pressing into my back causing the back pain and my hands jamming into the Saab's European seating design from the steering wheel, causing incredible pain.  I am trying to get out of my lease.  Saab has been no help.  So now I'm trying to just have someone take over the lease payments.  I hate this car!!  Never again with Saab.  I'm going back to Subaru!!"
saab,9-2x,2005,AsianJoe, 05/25/2005,Great Car For Your Money,4,"Decent real life gas mileage (23-27mpg).  Seats are two tone... black and tan (white?) looks great, but can get dirty fast. You can go to any store and get some scotch guard ($5 a can) to protect your investment.  Saab did a good job on noise reduction on the car, compared to the evil twin impreza.      "
saab,9-2x,2005,Tim, 05/23/2005,"Great Car, Great Price",4,"It was nice to see that I could get a high quality car for an affordable price.  The seats are a little stiff at first but they loosen up a bit later.  It would be nice to have a one touch moonroof but I think I can manage.  If it seems I am being nit-picky, I have to be.  I can find no major thing wrong with this car.  The ride and power obviously are comparable to the Subaru WRX.  The styling is Subaru with enough extras and finess to make it a Saab.  This is definitely not your mother's Saab.  I love it."
saab,9-2x,2005,tonedebone, 06/05/2005,Excellent car killed by inept marketing,4,"Take one globally respected rally car, add a pinch of style and a sprinkling of refinement; Sounds like the recipe for success. Trouble is, Saab thinks just putting their name on Subaru's econobox without any other major changes suddenly makes it worth BMW or Audi money. For what it is (a handsome, fast and agile wagon) this car can not be faulted. For what it claims to be (a premium branded vehicle) it falls way short. "
saab,9-2x,2005,Matt74, 06/08/2005,Great Affordable Option for Small Luxury,4,"Love this car.  It is fun to drive, looks great and has the reliability of Subaru and the finish of Saab. "
saab,9-2x,2005,JMD94, 06/20/2005,The Silver Bullet,4,"I caught WRX fever about 4 months ago and had been trying to figure out a way to buy one, but then, I stumbled upon reviews at Edmunds and then saw the GM discount and took the ""You only live once"" attitude. I love this car. I got a great deal on it, but more importantly, the 92x has reminded how much fun driving can be. It's only been a month, but so far, nothing but fun. It's a real head turner too, you just don't see many where I live in Bethesda, MD. The car hugs the road. My experience so far is that the 92x has a split personality. Drive conservatively, downshift and you can get good gas mileage. Hit 3000 rpm and Grandma's not going to miss bingo afterall, it feels like an F15!"
saab,9-2x,2005,Mike, 06/21/2005,The perfect sleeper,4,"I've lived Saabs for years. I briefly owned an unfortunate '86 SPG, but loved its quirkiness (overused adjective when describing Saabs, I know) as well as its performance. The Saabaru is a near perfect marriage of two iconic marquees, in terms of performance, quality and quirk. It's a real shame more people don't even consider this car when shopping, especially considering the ridiculous incentives GM is currently offering. The power is there, the handling is better day to day than the WRX, it's stealthy (both to cops and the kid in the modded Civic), it's well made, it has a great warranty, and it's different. That counts for a lot with me in this age of SUVs and boring Asian lookalikes."
saab,9-2x,2005,Craggar, 07/01/2005,My New Saabaru!,4,"If Beauty is only skin deep, this is the car it drives! Saab did a good job on the exterior styling, but underneath it all is a good ol' dependable Subaru. Interior trim is definitely econo-grade. I agree - this car is FUN to drive! The engine likes to rev, pulls strong from 3K on up to redline. Not much low-end torque. The 5-spd shifter is a bit notchy, but I'm getting used to it. AWD is great. No wheel spins in the Florida rain, you just GO. Fantastic brakes. One last thing - HEY SAAB, please fire the product manager and interior designer who picked the ""parchment"" seat color and don't hire them back until they can get coffee, ketchup and mud stains out of that fabric!           "
saab,9-2x,2005,archprof, 07/13/2005,Best of Both Worlds,4,"Right, so I bought my Satin Grey Aero for 22,500 out the door--9 miles on the clocks, bags on the seats (9 grand off sticker?? I'll take one, maybe two).  Only option on mine is the Sport Package, which is just a sunroof and beautiful 17"" wheels wrapped in decent RE011 Bridgestones. Most don't realize that this car has the STi's steering box (2.7 turns vs. 3 on the WRX) which is mounted with rigid bushings to the car, for a more responsive feel. And responsive it is!  Great handling, with all the body roll expected from Fuji Heavy Industries.  Easily fixed, mind you.  Really, the cornering is spot on--you will hug this car after driving hard in the rain!  Buy it now before August 1!  "
saab,9-2x,2005,wingnuttzz, 07/05/2005,Go manual tranny....,5,"With the employee discount and dealer incentives, I paid 18.5k for a 25.5k car.  I went to Subaru dealer, moonroof and heated seats only avail on sedan version of WRX, not on standard impreza or even the WRX wagon. This car drives like it is on rails.  I test frove the auto linear and it was underpowered, (165hp) for a AWD car.  5 speed is fun and optimizes performance.  Seats I scotch guarded, only complaint i have is that it came with the crappiest floor mats I ever saw.  I am gonna buy the Saab mats, $110 if they dont give them to me. Stereo also lacks punch, but its my wife's car primarily and she doesn't play it loud anyway. "

saab,9-2x,2005,Zach, 07/20/2005,Saabaru...Best five door for the money,4,"I was going to buy a WRX until I test drove the Saabaru. This is simply the best five door available--not just for the money, but period. Sure, there are some more upscale models filled with fluff (onboard navigation, various electronic gadgets, etc.) but most don't offer 220-hp with a tried and true engine, drivetrain, and turbocharger, let alone what is quite possibly the most reliable all-wheel drive system on the market. This car moves when you want it to (especially in Aero manual form, though the automatic is still spunky), just like the WRX, but is also a friendly daily driver. It performs like the WRX but drives like a Saab!"
saab,9-2x,2005,risacco, 07/29/2005,saab2xaero,4,"Terrific bargain at gm employee price.  Fun to drive, steering is best of any car I have ever owned, all wheel drive means no front wheel spin or hop on hard acceleration.  Awesome acceleration in 2nd gear when turbo spooled up.  Hatchback is very useful.  Like having a high performance car that looks tame."
saab,9-2x,2005,b9e, 07/29/2005,Yahoo a Saabaru,4,"Subaru and Saab are very similar companies. Both trace thier heritage to Airplanes, both make extensive use of Turbo charging, and both are, well, a little quirky. Not quite luxury brands, but a step above thier VW/Toyota breathren.      Saab has been known for hatchbacks, which, following the introduction of the 93 sport sedan, disappeared from the lineup. Enter the 92x. Basically a reskined Subie Impreza/Wrx, with some cabin quieting. The exterior looks more saab-like than the swedish made 93 sedan. And with the GM discount, it's cheaper than the Subaru.      Like the Impreza, this car handles great, but fuel consumption suffers (the much larger 93 gets better mpgs)."
saab,9-2x,2005,Hoagie, 08/11/2005,1st week,4,"So far, this car has been a blast to drive. The 165 hp is more than enough for my tastes. I have an hour drive, and am 6 ft, 230 lbs. No discomfort whatsoever. And 28 mph to boot. The 5 speed makes this package all the more fun."
saab,9-2x,2005,Eric, 08/19/2005,Saab 9-2x Linear,4,"Bought the last 9-2x Linear available in the city.  Even without the turbo, this car with 5-sp manual is a blast to drive."
saab,9-2x,2005,9-2Xtra, 09/22/2005,Great little commuter car,4,"I got this car to save on gas, but have fun while doing it.  It is dead- on-target for me.  I haven't tested the AWD in snow yet, but you can't make it slip in the wet at all.  Also, this car is closely related to Subaru Impreza/WRX, so performance modifications from mild to monstrous are readily possible - the parts are there.  I really feel like I took 20 years off my age when I bought this car.  It is that much fun to drive.  The Linear doesn't require premium fuel like the Aero, either, so that tradeoff worked in my favor as well.  If you can find one of these, you owe it to yourself to test-drive it."
saab,9-2x,2005,CHLLR, 09/21/2005,BEST BUY,4,"Excellent combination of Saab inspired good looks, quiet cabin and Subaru practicality, sporty performance, race proven chassis design and reliability. Umpteen suppliers from aftermarket for Impreza WRX souped-up parts. "
saab,9-2x,2005,L. Zeitlin, 10/04/2005,Conservative hotrod,4,"The Saab Aero 92x is just the thing for senior citizens who want to recapture their youthful love affair with high performance automobiles yet not flaunt their second childhood in front of their neighbors. Encased in an attractive, upscale yet conservative, body lies the mechanicals of the firebreating Subaru WRX. This implies wonderfully responsive AWD handling, breathtaking midrange acceleration, near felony range top speed, and good reliability. And when you park the car you go back to being a responsible member of society. The only giveaway is the turbo scoop on the hood. There are few downsides except the requirement for premium gas. This is the penalty for the adventure."
saab,9-2x,2005,phillyexpat, 10/06/2005,Awesome little rocket,4,"Wow... so I wanted the Aero, but only wanted to pay for the Linear.  This car still is a rocket and such a blast to drive.  While it may not be quite as solid as a BMW costing 20k more, it handles just as assuredly.  I love this car so much."
saab,9-2x,2005,JWF, 11/02/2005,Why is my wife hogging my car?,4,"Guess mainly because of the inherent reliability. No way is this car gonna leave her stranded.

Off course, the GM discount did not hurt either!"
saab,9-2x,2005,Bryan, 11/13/2005,Saabaru,4,"My wife and I were shopping for a used Saab 9-5 wagon when we drove this at the dealer.  The ride was amazing and my wife feel in love.  With the employee pricing it was a huge steal.  It isn't a true Saab, but it is one helluva Subaru.  "
saab,9-2x,2005,Phil, 01/13/2006,Still in love,4,"More than 9 months and 10,000 miles later, and I still love my 92X.  Great pickup (couldn't stand the lag on the Aero version, so I bought the Linear). Handles very well.  It has more room for cargo than you'd expect, especially with the seats down.  Just took it skiing in WV, and it handled the snowy hills without a single problem.  And all my friends are impressed by it."
saab,9-2x,2005,Svenka Aeroplan AB, 01/15/2006,9-2X happiness,4,"Everyone wants to know if the 9-2X is worth the price premium over the Subaru Impreza wagon which it is based. It depends on what is important to the owner. GM/Saab definitely overpriced the 9-2X at first, but late summer incentives convinced me to buy. I really wanted a hatchback (3-door), but no automaker seems to want to offer this handy configuration anymore. So the 9-2X gives me two extra doors i will never need for hauling the two of us to the park, skiing, or on a weekend trip. Fuel economy predictably stinks for a car this size, but part of that is due to the desire of the driver to truly exercise the peppy engine and actually utilise the all-wheel-drive. Overall, the 9-2x is superb!"
saab,9-2x,2005,sagebrush, 02/19/2006,Fit for me and fun to drive,4,"I choose this car for fit to my driving style, safety and fun to drive.  I like a manual, compact car and the styling suited my step up from traditional GM cars.  I knew it was a Saaburu - but for someone who wanted a manual 5 sp with AWD, and didn't look like a boy's car (I'm middle-aged professional woman), the 9-2X is a kick to drive.  I feel safe with some fun power.  I hit a deer doing 50 mph and the car didn't even quiver (the windshield didn't fare too well - but held).  While I don't disagree with the reviews - I still love my car - and that is what counts.  "
saab,9-2x,2005,apowell, 04/19/2006,Better than it's WRX cousin,4,"Purchased the car during in July 2005, and have been very happy with everything, except turbo lag.  The 2006 model gets a larger engine and should fix this problem.  The car performs very well, so well that in snow and ice I can punch the gas and the 9-2x flys off the line.  I also like the interior, easy to read gauges and very supportive seats (much better than WRX seats), also I chose the cold weather package w/ heated seats.  The WRX only offers heated seats w/ the limited package (a $2000 option on WRX)!!!"
saab,9-2x,2005,Gina, 07/30/2006,Great buy,4,"Great car. Love the free oil changes and maintenance. Have not had one problem except using the wrong gasoline. Must use detergent gasoline (Shell, Amoco, etc). non-detergent gasoline will slow start-ups. Very comfortable car."
saab,9-2x,2005,John, 03/30/2007,Saabaru 9-2x,3,This is a great little car the only problems I had when I bought it was that the tires bubbled in under 10000 miles and I had to replace them with performance tires because no good tire company makes all weather tires for this car but bridgestone and they were the original tires.
saab,9-2x,2005,Johnnymauler, 05/17/2007,A good but not great little car.,4,I have had some problems with the tires and wheels on this car.  After only about 10000 miles all of the Bridgestone tires bubbled and half my rims were bent.  I had to buy new tires and aftermarket wheels.

saab,9-2x,2005,happy, 08/02/2007,No regrets with Linear model,4,"Just traded my SUV in for this.  I was looking for a unique car under 20 grand that had the best blend of performance, economy, style, and either awd or 4wd.  The only tough question was to go for the Aero or Linear.  Turbo sounds nice but I'm done with paying for premium fuel.  Plus the Linear averages 25-32 mpg on 87 octane.  The Aero barely beats my SUV and requires prem fuel.  The Linear will still snap your neck back into the headrest off the line and 5th gear is strong enough to conquer steep grade hills without the need to downshift.  Overall fewer luxury options than most premium brands but it has all the basics.  Heated seats, 6 disc changer, and decent leather will do me just fine."
saab,9-2x,2005,Bret, 11/26/2007,My 9-2X,4,Great car wish it came with leather seats in the 05 model.  I like the Subaru engine and look. Runs very fast and agile.

saab,9-2x,2005,Disgruntled Saab Man, 04/10/2008,Electrical Problems - beware,3,"I had heard Saab was reliable and the new models did have pazazz and class. Wrong.  Uncomfortable seats, and from the first I had problems with electrical.  After setting for 3-4 days, the battery was completely dead.  Then it would be fine for a month or so; then repeat the problem.  The dealer was clueless. They replaced the battery and the alternator, which I told them was not the problem.  I had a Jeep once with same problem.  It was a wiring problem that drained the system.  But, they knew best.  Finally they offered me an insulting trade down to a used VW with outrageous payments.  I took it to Carmax and got a Honda.  Carmax is where I now buy all of my cars (Hondas).  Great place."
saab,9-2x,2005,Charlipopping, 09/22/2020,Equilibrium,5,"Of all the car i've try and own it's the car that has give me the best balance between praticality and driving pleasure. Quick the suspension is amazing and in perfect harmony with the steering. The suspension is superb too use and the acceleration are more then adequate. The AWD system with the lsd is the best i've ever tried tied with the wrx sti, just mind blowing. Sound system is good tissus seats were right between confort and sportiness, superb. Trunk and fuel economy is good. Maintenance is expensive tho but a well maintain subaru is reliable. In the end the driving experience ressemble the one of a miata but with hhhuuummmfff of a wrx and the praticality of station wagon. A mind blowing gems forget by everyone.

saab,9-2x,2006,mdnumber32, 12/19/2009,Make it more of a Saab!,4,"I really like this car, and the fact that you don't see them all over the place, however, Saab did almost nothing to make it their own, which is really disappointing for a car company with so much personality.  No problems so far after 6 months of ownership.  I'm just recently finding out that the heated seats get perfectly warm very fast, and I love that they're paired with cloth upholstery.  I've gone through 4 cars in the past 2 years and this is certainly the most satisfying.  The sound system is horrible, and the heat and air can't really be turned up to a very high max (important for super hot and cold days)."
saab,9-2x,2006,Kenpost, 10/02/2006,9-2X is not for everyone,3,All that says Saab is not Saab. I may have had an exception but even my friends who drive Subarus discribe their experience differently. My 9-2X had a very annoying gear hum that over shadowed any other good qualites. The auto transmission was 20 years behind the times in techno. At low speeds it seemed to always be looking for the right gear. GM has has acted wisely in dropping this model from the future Saab line up. I have followed their lead and traded it after only 1 month. 
saab,9-2x,2006,KLauder, 12/06/2005,9-2x fun and fulfilling,4,I've had the 9-2x since this summer and so far it has been a very fun car.  The AWD and turbo make city drivng fun with it's quickness and cornering abilities.   Having traded in a muscle car that was killing me in gas it has been a lot easier on the wallet at fillup time. Not as great as I expected (about 20 MPG avg.) but that is probably a combination of driving it in a fun manner and the city driving.  With two kids it has also been easier having a four door vehicle but keeping a sporty look and feel.
saab,9-2x,2006,Pete, 10/28/2006,Saaberration,4,"This is definitely an aberration from the typical Saab lineup.  Albeit a quick way for Saab to get an AWD to market, it still leans heavily towards Fuji Heavy Industries.  Ironic that both companies originally made aircraft.  Saab's adjustment to the exterior, gearing, steering, and suspension definitely paid off.  It's handling was excellent.  It loved to be pushed and responded well to pinning it centripetally into corners with acceleration.  On the other hand, it was loud and the interior was most definitely Subaru.  After professionally soundproofing all 4 doors, it was still noisy.  "
saab,9-2x,2006,NY owner, 02/12/2008,Great purchase,4,"This is a great car, the handling and performance is excellent, and with the rebates given when the model was going out, it was an amazing purchase. I specially love cornering in twisty roads and the response in steering."
saab,9-2x,2006,pgh92x, 03/14/2006,Functional SUV Alternative,3,The car itself is sporty and gas mileage is good for an AWD. The AWD performs well in the snow but soft-roading is made a little more exciting by the vehicles light weight and lack of stability control. In deep mud and snow I have never felt at threat of getting stuck.  Overall it is fun to drive and inspires confidence.  The 9-2x has all the cargo space and flexibility of a compact suv but feels adequate rather not ample in passenger space. This car would  not likely be optimal as a family hauler for more than 4.   The interior is sporty if austere and I found  that Subaru after-market parts helped round out the options and upgrades. The leather helps solidify the upscale feel
saab,9-2x,2006,Chris Shuba, 05/19/2006,One with the auto....,4,"I just bought this car a bit ago, and decided to go with the 2.5 linear simply because of cost and fuel economy. They both get relatively similar mileage, but the aero takes premium. Aside from that the car is a dream. Though the engine does lag a bit when the petals fully down, this thing is quick. The ""cock-pit"" flawlessly integrates the driver into the vehicle. The most attractive feature is the suspension. The car glides silently and smoothly over any road abnormality. Its a clean, simple, beautiful automobile. Quirky and different it may be, but its solid and practical as well. I look forward to errands... 'nough said."
saab,9-2x,2006,fred walters, 07/06/2006,A real fun car to drive,4,This car is so much fun to drive. you must get the 5 speed standard shift to really appreciate the handling and the pickup. The fuel economy is very good. The quality is also very good and it looks great.

saab,9-3,2000,m11171, 10/03/2011,Swedish Sleeper...a future classic,4,"They don't build cars like the Viggen anymore. This car is an animal, pure and simple. But, with 5-door configuration, I can take my family and plenty of belongings (in the huge hatch) anywhere in comfort and safety.

This is a very limited production car. With the right modifications, they can be made into not just fast - but also excellent handling vehicles. As long as you stay on top of maintenance these cars are fun and reliable transportation.

The acceleration on this car will shock those who don't know what this car is. This is the fastest car SAAB ever produced, and remains so to this day (Oct 2011). Still, I get 31 mpg on the highway and about 20 in the city. Love it!"

The first (1995 conv) had massive battery/electrical/conv. problems and this one needed a new engine. This model has a newly found defect that Saab calls ""engine sludge."" They are covering this problem under the warranty but beware it decreases performance until you take it in or until it strands you on the highway. I have finally decided that it doesn't make sense for me to pay the upgrade for a performance vehicle when the performance deteriorates. Alas, it is all under warranty but the fact that it needed a new engine is going to really hurt my resale value. I've loved these cars eventhough they proved to not be worth the luxury pricetag."

After purchasing it the di-cassette went out, costing $700.  I have had numerous oil pumps and hoses replaced each time to the shop it is $300.  Then my AC compressor went out, causing the Reciever/Dryer to go out.  This is $1500 to fix.  Had the car back for 15 minutes and the serpentine belt went out.  Over all the car has been in the shop 5 times in a year.  I will be selling the car as soon as I get it out of the shop.  It gets better....the part I need (receiever/dryer) is on national back order for 6 months.  RED FLAG."

After having the car for 2 months, the engine completely blew (as well as the Turbo and catalytic converter) because of a known issue with this 2000 model -- oil sludge.  I fought and fought and fought for MONTHS with Saab corporate to fix my $15,000 used lemon.  Saab Corporate kept insisting that I PROVE the vehicle had proper maintenance (i.e. oil changes) throughout its life. BUT I had JUST bought the vehicle from a Miami dealer as a CERTIFIED USED vehicle.  That, by definition, means the vehicle had a proper maintenance throughout its history.  Saab eventually replaced engine, turbo and now the car is fantatic!"
saab,9-3,2000,Kabir, 03/22/2010,Fun to drive no fun on your wallet,4,"Owning my Viggen was like being addicted to a drug. You know it's bad but you cant get rid of it. It was the most fun to drive car I ever owned. I've had an older Porsche and many BMW's but the Saab blew them away when it came to fun. I had to replace the engine at 120,000km ($8000repair bill) then a piston went 5 months later. My dad had a 9-5 at the same time and had nothing but trouble also. Stay away from these car's GM ruined them. If you want a Saab look for a pre 1991 model that's when they were reliable. On a positive my Viggen got AMAZING fuel economy for a turbo car.

Sadly, I have been stranded 6 times in this car, the first after owning it less than a year. In addition to normal regular maintenance, the DI cassette has gone twice, seat belt replaced, water pump broke, AC compressor (broke again within 4 months) to name just a few items. I love the look of the car and used to enjoy driving it but no longer have the confidence that I will get to where I am going safely. I would not buy another Saab after my experience.

I also had to change out the radiator before 150000 mile. There was a problem with the driver seatbelt which made me want to get rid of it.

I got it a year ago during my senior year of highschool, and ever since then I have love every bit of it. My only problem with it is that it is a little worn. There are some airflow issues and the radiator was leaking but these were not manufacturing flaws but probably from the former owner(s). I wish I could have drove it when it was new but sadly I can't. Oh and these cars are pretty strong, because yesterday I got rear ended pretty hard by a honda accord and came out with just a dent and scratches on the rear bumper... can't say much for the honda though.

The worst issue has been the engine completely blowing at 96,000 miles due to ""sludge"" build-up. It cost me about $7,000 to replace mine. I have been stranded twice due to DI cassette failure and twice for serpentine belt failure. I have also had to replaced the AC compressor. Do not buy!"
saab,9-3,2000,Saab no more, 05/16/2003,Saab no more,4,"Test drive it and you'll own it!  Own 
it and you won't buy it again.  I truly 
love my car and wish that so many 
quirky itmes were not wrong with it: 
endless squeky brackes, endless knob & 
button replacements, continued ""engie 
light"" on and off, just poor 
craftsmanship on the car.  It looks 
great, drives great... and I hate to 
say that the Saab dealer service dept. 
knows me by name... I am swithching to 
BMW!"
saab,9-3,2000,Stardog, 02/23/2004,A good car but not as good ...,4,"I've owned my 9-3SE conv. for almost a 
year now. There's a lot I like about it 
and some things I don't. It's a great 
all-season car with front-wheel drive 
and heated seats. With the rear 
windscreen and heated seats I can 
easily have the top down on a sunny 45F 
day. Acceleration is good. The trunk is 
roomy. The fit and finish on the car 
doesn't measure up. There are LOTS of 
squeaks, rattles and windnoise. Various 
gauges don't work and the Saab emblem 
on the trunk fell off. The foot well is 
very crowded. For the price it doesn't 
measure up in comfort and luxury but 
it's a good car and fun to drive."
saab,9-3,2000,Ted, 06/07/2008,Wonderful Car,4,"When I went to the dealership, I had no intention of buying a convertible, but the salesman pointed out that I could have one for about the same price, and I ended up buying one.  Apparently I have good luck, because I bought the car with 103,500 miles and have had no problems at all.  The car is an automatic (I would have preferred a manual), but it is still quite peppy.  I install a Saab cat-back exhaust and an open air intake -- this combo has made for an AWESOME turbo sound, as well as increased response.  I have been surprised by the countless convenience features of this car - all little things, but proof in the well thought out Swedish design."

93 fits me fine.  The cargo space is 
unmatched.  I simply can not fit in 
any 3 series BMW and Audi's are too 
plentiful in my area.  I've always loved 
the uniqueness of a SAAB and the 
93 delivers.  The turbo 185 is perfect 
- not slow, but fast enough to have 
some fun.  The leather in the car is 
top quality as well."

the tire and rim problem. I am on my 
second new rim, and six new tires. THIS 
IS NOT A CAR FOR NYC! I write this now, 
because at first i thought it was just 
my fiance or my driving. then I thought 
it was bad luck, then i thought it was 
the tire company, until finally a

class action lawsuit for all those saab 
owners who have rims like a tin can and 
are going through tires like underwear! 
So, if you are going to buy this car

after market steel 15 inch rims with 
new tires and then you'll have a solid

saab,9-3,2000,2000ATL_Viggen, 06/05/2002,The best choice,4,"Bought used because I can't afford 
new.  Drove all the competitors; BMW

This car is for the driver who does not 
stay in the status quo lane.  The 
Viggen's handling is great.  Front 
wheel drive takes some getting used 
to.  Torque steer?  Educate yourself 
about what torque steer really is.  
This car doesn't suffer from it.  
There's a little turbo lag but when you 
finally adjust to the clutch it's 
minor.  I love the quirkiness of the 
Saab. Allows me to break out of the 
norm (and blow away the Beamers)."

performance (to include high speed 
autobahn style driving) but also hates

being stuck in the back during a road 
trip.  This car has great interior room

engine is extreemly strong although if 
you're looking for a stoplight racer - 
get a Mustang.  If your looking for a

viggens and have no plans to make an

the king of the saabs in my opinion."

Manufacturer doesn't seem to stand

Shows its cheap European GM Cavalier frame through poor handling with too much understeer and being very cluncky to drive. Poor build quality and has been unreliable. While reasonably quick, it does require at least 91 octane gas to avoid engine issues but I knew this is a requirement with all turbo's. Air conditioning failed, switches on dash failed, LED display failing piece by piece, I could go on. I hope the new model is a better car - it needs to be!"

for it at the gas pump. I test drove a used Acura TL 
a while back, just out of curiosity, and it felt a bit 
numb. Got back into the Saab and it was like 
driving a Euro hotrod. I feel involved when I drive 
this car. I might have qualms about some of

I can load and entire weekends worth of gear for my baby, my wife and myself and still not have to overflow into the cabin. The Trunk is a cavern. I can set the cruise at 75mph and get close to 30 mpg. I could go on and on but the list is too numerous.

Rides firm (but not harsh), responsive steering and brakes, and acceleration is phenomenal.  With the Viggen's torque and horses, you WILL leave cars behind rather easily.  However, the car IS rather temperamental and requires TLC.  If you drive on other than the SMOOTHEST of roads, you'll probably bend the rims, requiring immediate attention so as not to ruin your alignment.  Additionally, we just passed 100k, and our water pump, brakes and a/c compressor all went out within 2k miles of each other, amounting to almost $3k in repairs.  Be aware - but you can definitely enjoy yourself!"

saab,9-3,2000,Copy, 12/21/2005,The Best Ever,4,I was a little reluctant to get the new Saab (back in 2000) but something made me to for 3 years later. This convertible is the best ever. In California never Had a problem. It is amazing how fast you can pass any car with the turbo. Even in California this car is an icon and everyone watches you pass. I am proud I made the best decision.

other car is a 2001 9-5 SAAB. I have 
had only SAABs in the last 12 years.  
The 9-3 model is the best SAAB yet. 
Earlier SAABs had many manufacturing 
defects and they were truly a saab(sob) 
story.  General Motors has seemed to 
clean up their act however. I have had 
few mechanical problems and since my 
warranty goes to 45,000 miles, all have 
been fixed quickly.  Also the no 
maintenance cost program is great.  I 
paid for the 40,000 mile checkup but 
that has been all.  Tires are a 
problem. I am now on my 3rd set. Only

get another Saab when my lease is up."

It has improved suspension, wheels, brakes, aerodynamics, seats, electronics, computer settings for the engine (higher horse power).  Overall it is a pleasure to drive. Instant acceleration, great cornering, handling and control when braking at high speeds.  Because of the high torque it does have torque steer which is most noticable at lower speed acceleration.  31+ mpg highway - 29 mpg country road commute.  This car is for you if you enjoy windy country roads taken at fast speeds."

seized under normal use to what Saab 
said was ""bad gas"".  They refused to 
honor the warranty and wanted $8000 to 
replace the engine in a car I am 
leasing.  Eventually, they fixed it 
for $1200 but it should have been 
covered.  My case was not an isolated 
one and the company knew this.  Very

The extended warranty for oil sludge is the biggest scam. The Saab admits that there is the problem but at the same time they the requirement for the warranty is all oil change receipts from the beginning. I am the second owner of this car. I am missing only 2 oil receipts from the first owner ( 20,000 & 30,000 miles). The Saab Corp. refused to replace my engine because I am missing these 2 oil receipts. The worst service ever. After thousands of $$ I spent on this car , it is a junk now worth $0. I am preparing for a law suit now. Stay away from Saab "
saab,9-3,2000,derekdrl, 05/22/2008,It's what you know about high output,4,"First of all I hear people talking about sludge in a turbo motor, only thing is if you ask 90% of them people they were using conv. Oil (its a high output motor that needs synthetic motor oil) 2nd thing is there are some things wrong like the hud (heads up display) big deal, but in comparison to other vehicles in class small problems are worth the 10k in savings, I've made my Saab a full blown race car and beat it up pretty bad and things have gone wrong but the heart of the vehicle is as strong as the day I bought it. So what I'm saying is if you are cheap on parts and service (I. E. - synthetic oil every 3k miles and premium gas then that's what happens). It's not a Ford!"

We have logged 99k and are thinking of trading. I drove a 05 9-3 Arc and its seats aren't as nice and although it has 210 hp, somehow my 2000 with 185 hp seems just as fast.

I would consider it decently reliable but, the parts feel like there unnecessary expensive compared to cars of the same size.

saab,9-3,2001,Louisville Vicar, 02/17/2016,"Great Value, Good Mechanic is Key",4,"We've had our 2001 Saab 9-3 for 10 years now, and recently thought about saying good-bye.  It's worth about $1500 to a private party, but it's way more more car than that!  

The truth, as I see it is this: If you have a mechanic who knows Saabs, owns the right equipment, and understands how to fix them, you are good-to-go.  We are lucky to have Ray and Rich at Auto Works of Knoxville in our area.  Ray bought all the right equipment to service Saabs years ago, and customers come from as far as St. Louis, MO to have their Saabs worked on here.  Ray and Rich know these cars and keep us up and running.

Saabs are Saabs...quirky and sometimes frustrating to own.  Ours, we call her ""Sadie"", will suddenly decided she's going to turn on the check engine light and stay in second gear.  The fix is a reset with a code reader.  Works great for six months, then she does it again.  

Then about every two years, she'll just stop running at a stop sign.  Suddenly starts idling rough and shuts down.  Solution?  Rich cleans the throttle body and resets the computer.  ""The next time, though, the throttle body will need replacement"" says he.  Ray says we can still keep driving her, he can still get parts, and anticipates he will be able to for years to come.  

Stellar performance, especially from a car valued at $1500....Oh yeah, we spent $600 last year to fix a tiny, flimsy switch that lets the top go down successfully.  You have to be able to cuss in Swedish to get your fingers in the place this thing goes, and the flimsy switch is replaced by another...flimsy switch.  But hey, it still works and is fun.  ""That's cool!"" observes our Grandson Sam as he watches the top cycle.

It is.  We're keeping her.

The Viggen has all the comfort and luxury and outstanding performance too.  The turbo kick at almost any speed is exhilirating.  Torque steer is an issue, but there are aftermarket cures for that.  Exterior look of the car is very ""euro"" and hatchback yields excellent cargo capability.  Interior is comfortable, lack of cupholders just emphasizes that you should be driving the car when you are in it, not drinking (or talking on the phone).  No automatic available anyway, so keep your hands free for driving!  Viggen's have a loyal following too, so expect used prices to be pretty stable."

Disregard the comments about GM build quality, all built in the same factory forever.  Not a Sedan so don't expect the same trunk space or the feel. Understand a convertible before you buy one and if you buy a used car understand that repairs will be necessary.  I really like the car which is clear since I now own 2.

I dont drive it hard cuz it gets noticed more going low and slow witch is what i like (less speeding tickets) but out on the high was its stable, flat and has more than ample power for passing. but like all Turbo engines the best bet is to change your oil every 4000km with synthetic"
saab,9-3,2001,Jas H, 01/08/2006,Viggen with Vigor,5,"This Saab Viggen is the best of their cars.   She flies and handles like the jet she's named after.   The car has been clocked at 152 with a bit more reserve and never felt strained or loose.   On the highway (if I stay out of the boost range except for some spirited passing) I average 31.5 mpg.   I can do the PA to FL run in 18 hours to Melbourne and be as fresh as when starting.   She's one silent strong sexy steed!    With the hatchback I can carry a large load and yet retain the sleek looks or run light and nimble all day, either way a winner.   The Viggen is a unique auto, the fun of a Porsche Cayman, the practicality of a wagon, the economy of a VW, a sweet ride!!!"
saab,9-3,2001,DonCNY, 02/08/2006,can't do better for the money,5,"Bought used for $20k with 50k miles on it -  it still feels as solid as a new car. Even the weatherstripping is still in great shape. Being a chop-top convertible, it was a bit shaky on bumpy roads and you could feel some body flex when cornering. I've added a subframe brace and swapped in a bigger rear anti-roll bar, and it now feels very solid. I can't believe how well this thing handles now as a FWD car, especially with the OE Goodyear all-seasons on it. Whenever I think I might be pushing it a little too hard it just hangs right on without so much as a howl. Why spend $5-6k more on the equivalent BMW when you can do just as well with under $400 worth of easy-to-install modifications?"
saab,9-3,2001,Ray, 02/15/2017,The Best Sleeper Cars,5,"I own and have owned my 2001 SAAB Viggen  for 16 years and done lots of upgrades to engine, suspension and wheels. That make it a car that I have surprised a lot of high priced sports cars even ones with V8s. Still love my car even with the time showing on the seats. No accidents or dings just a lot of TLC that helped it get to 178000 miles. Hope to see 200000.

saab,9-3,2001,lotek, 08/21/2012,Buyer Beware,2,"If you're thinking about buying a 9-3 Hatchback: don't think twice, just walk away. If you work on your vehicles yourself you'll end up tearing your hair out because everything in the engine compartment is so poorly planned, parts are hard to find and expensive. Good luck finding a mechanic that will touch it. I bought this car 2 years ago and have had nothing but problems for the last year and a half (and it's been well taken care of). There are so many people saying they're happy I felt it necessary to share my absolutely terrible experience with this car. I find it no surprise Saab isn't around anymore."

The engine has plenty of power along with excellent gas mileage. A shame Saab did away with the hatchback. The newer models look more like every other cookie cutter car. Love this car so much we sold our Volvo and purchased another 2001 9-3

electrical problems"
saab,9-3,2001,none, 03/07/2005,Fun and Safe,4,I test drove this car and the Volvo S60 and the 9-3 won for overall driving experience. I have 88k miles on it and it has never let me down. I was hoping to drive this car for many many more miles but I was just in a major accident so it may be totalled. The good news is that I and my infant son were not harmed at all despite being hit at over 30mph.The frame took the impact as it should and in a lesser car we could have been seriously injured. I won't be looking at another Saab mainly because of design changes and different needs but I loved this car and am very thankful that we had it. The brakes are excellent and itis fun to drive in addition to being one of the safest cars on the road.
saab,9-3,2001,dogwood, 05/31/2006,Saabs are great,4,"I have had a great experience with this car. I love the way it drives. (I like the manual transmission turbo) The seats are super comfortable (great seat heaters!) and there is tons of interior room for the size of the car. I average 27 MPG. It is easy to park, easy to drive, and has not been anymore expensive to maintain then our toyota. I highly reccommend the Saab 9-3"
saab,9-3,2001,rb85, 01/08/2012,What a shame,3,"This car worked perfectly for me and I loved everything about it. It had good power, fuel economy, lots of cargo space, I like the way it looked and drove. I bought it used with about 57000 miles and in the four years I owned it I had to replace the turbo, throttle body, and timing chain to the tune of about $3k total. Then one month before I would have paid it off cylinder no.2 overheated, causing the piston rings to go. The engine was destroyed. The SAAB shop I was dealing with said a used motor installed would have cost almost $4k. I liked everything about the car except the reliability wasn't there and its very expensive to fix. SAABs were good in the early 90's, not anymore."

VERY costly.  Expect to have at least $250 -  $500 in mechanic bills quarterly.  Other than that, i love how it looks, how it handles, the size, the interior.  Just wish it was better built."
saab,9-3,2001,Glickchick, 11/25/2003,GM can't build Saab,2,"This is the second Saab I have leased.  
The difference between the last car and 
this one appears to be that GM has 
taken over production.  It is appointed 
only slightly better than a Chevy and 
is considerably less reliable and 
performance-oriented than my last 
Saab.  Of specific concern is the 
suspension; it is too low and the car 
is prone to flat tires and suspension 
problems."

went on and the dealer could care less 
about fixing them. Also had front

display LED got moisture behind it and

saab,9-3,2001,TrollHattanINsf, 08/01/2009,Mixed Feelings - Saab Enthusiast,3,"While I am a SAAB enthusiast, I have been less than enthusiastic with this car. When purchased, the vehicle was in good condition and looked over in Denver. However, within months I was repairing. Some cosmetic - totally my prerogative, and others necessary. Here's the necessaries: 1. Fog lamps cracked on the highway - design flaw of glass with no protection. These are $200/ea 2. Water Pump + hosing 3. Serpentine belts 4. Multiple headlamp halogens & multiple brake pad sets (I drive 5600/yr) 5. Engine Mts., Trans. Mounts 6. Front Wheel Bearings (under 70K) 7. Window motors + mechanism 8. Hydraulics for the top 9. SID re-manufactured 10. Mass Airflow meter It feels like a $$ pit."
saab,9-3,2001,DooleyW, 08/27/2002,"Fun, But look out!",4,"The Viggen is a joy to drive, just know 
that gear selection is very important 
as turbo lag can put the unwary in 
precarious positions in a hurry.  Watch 
out for the expensive wheels, they are 
easily bent.  The wheels are not cheap 
to replace.  In 20,000 miles of city 
driving I've had to replace 4 wheels.  
If you buy a Viggen, for God's sake, 
get plastic impact covers for the fog 
lights and the headlights, it costs 
more to replace one headlight than the 
entire windshield.  Performance-wise 
the car is a joy but 
requires much of the driver.  The 
Viggen doesn't suffer so much from 
torque-steer as it does an exceedingly 
light touch when hard on the gas."

Amazing gas mileage with the 185 engine (low to mid thirties on the road) and a five-speed stickshift.  Plan to keep it for another five years or so!  No car is perfect - but this car comes close when one considers the designer's fidelity to the Saab heritage.  My first Saab was a three-cylinder. I know what I am talking about!"

My cousin and I took it through a canyon and we got the speed up to 115 miles per hour. Not very smart, but I couldn't believe how it handled the turns it was absolutely amazing. Now the bad part the electrical is terrible in this car, I always had a problem with it. I couldn't get it fixed the mechanic couldn't find out why my emergency lights wouldn't stop flashing so I sold the car. Even though I had trouble with the car, I am wishing I never had gotten rid of it. The car was a blast to drive. "

And I know what I am talking about - I have had to do that a lot and that ain't cheap! Bought it 3 years ago, had been leased for 3 years. Should have gotten the hint with all the things I had done on it while under the warranty still. I have had to pay $600-$1200 repairs on it several times a year for the past 3 years and I finally gave up and dumped this piece of workmanjunk at a pretty big loss!  If you haven't bought one, but consider it, seriously reconsider. If you have one and are seeing problems mount, just get rid of it ASAP - too expensive to fix everything, all the time!"

Its best features are the fun factor - great responsive motor and handling, classic styling (the newer cars have become too homogeneous), and reliability which is surprising for Saab.  There have been a couple costly part replacements, but over time that's to be expected.  It's certainly been more reliable than our '05 Toyota Sequoia.  After 8 yrs my eyes have begun to wander to possible replacements (e.g., M3), but the Saab keeps running strong, and if I ""traded up"" I suspect I'd miss the Saab more than I'd like the newer car.

convertible from the corvette to lexus

the best to offer. We wanted a 
convertible with enough storage to go 
away for a weekend with golf clubs (two 
sets!) And we like the automatic 
retractable top with a glass window 
that has a built in boot to cover the 
cloth top for a nice clean look (unlike 
a jag). Lots of nice speed and front-
wheel drive is nice too. Sticker was 
higher than a BMW325, but the dealer

wonderful.  That's the good part.  The 
reality is the dealer service is 
horrible, they treat you like a child.  
The car is not reliable, as it has left 
me stranded 3 times in a year.  The 
last issue in July as a potential fire 
hazard.  Over 1/4 tank of gas poured 
out of the gas tank (broken fuel line 
bracket to the tank).  One spark and my 
family could have been dead.  Bet you 
have never had a Fire Dept. Engine come 
out to certify your cars' safety, well 
I have.  Dealer was very nonchalant 
about the issue.  Saab Legal is also

ready to move into the fast lane; even 
with the minimum sized 2.0 Turbo 
engine.  The ride is firm, but 
comfortable.  The interior is quiet,

said ""what the hell"" and the next 
thing I know I was putting money down

Shortly after buying the car I noticed thick grey smoke belching out of the exhaust when I started it. I took it to the dealer and was advised that my turbo was on the way out...price of repair $1,600.  I also soon noticed that: my stereo lights don't come on at night, driver's side fog light assembly is broken, antenna works when it wants to and my sunroof frame is prematurely rusting and bubbling.

Now that it is out of warranty, its becoming quite annoying, but it's paid for, and the repairs are cheaper than a car payment.  Saab has lost its style. The new ones look just like Audi and BMW.  Too bad, unique style was the only thing going for it.  Anyway, beware if you buy.  Many quirky problems, hard to find & expensive repair shops.  Oh, and the car really depreciates which is another reason I haven't ridded myself of it yet... can't bear to take the loss.

just under 18,000 miles.  The fit and 
finish were flawless; I have not had 
any non-routine maintenance performed.  
This car handles very well in turns, 
has a solid ""quality"" feel, carries 
lots of people and gear while retaining 
a small sportscar look.  Great sound

saab,9-3,2001,Sviden, 06/03/2003,Perfect more than 2 years,5,"I own this SAAB for more than 2 years
and so far the reliability of the car
was PERFECT without a single fix for
more than a 2 year. The ride and
Handling is outstanding especially the
low RPM High Torque which kicks at his
Maximum in as low as 1900 RPM!!! High
Speed handling is also fantastic. Don't
need to mention the breathtaking Stereo
which is old Saab tradition. There are a
lot other features which I like. To make
the story short - This is one Fantastic Car."
saab,9-3,2001,stacy, 04/11/2008,Worst car ever,3,"I purchased a used Saab that had 35,000 miles when I bought it. In a 2 yr. period it has had approx. $7,000 in engine work done on it and the problem is still not fixed. It doesn't matter how many bells and whistles a car has if it wont run. I am not sure what kind of aircraft this car was born from but I would not want to fly in it. My advice is run, run far away!"
saab,9-3,2001,SergioC, 05/25/2008,Saab never again! Maybe a BMW,3,"First the positive on this car. This is a fun car to drive except to the shop or dealing with GM. The turbo charged went bad at 65,000 miles. GM customer service is the worse I ever dealt with it. Now it will cost me over 1,700 dollars on repairs since GM do not want to knowledge of the problem with the turbo charger that it should not gone bad. I am finally give up on this piece of junk and never will buy another GM or SAAB. If you think to buy a SAAB, please reconsider that it's a GM product now not a SAAB."
saab,9-3,2002,zidjan, 03/26/2014,The best used car you can get for your money.,4,"I started with saab 10 years ago, bought the 1999 model but has tons of issue. Sold it cheap and I ended up with the 2002 model se at 80K miles. Nowthe car has 120K and had no problems at all. It's all been fun with this car...205 hp and gets 30mpg hwy miles driving 65-70 mph. 

So my conclusion to new buyer out there, research the history of the car, if the car has always used synthetic oil and been taken care of well, chances are you'll have a good reliable car...but if anything points out that this car has not been care well then buyer's beware. 

NEVER Buy this car if you are going to treat it like a Honda or Toyota. You'll reap what you sow."
saab,9-3,2002,Andrew, 04/26/2010,Great Convertible,4,"I purchaced my SAAB in 2006 with 50000 miles. The car now has 85000 and has had few problems besides routine repairs (front brakes, new battery, tires) the only problem I have had is the digits burning out on the Saab Information Display (SID). I sent the unit away for inexpensive repair and have had no further problems. I change the oil regularly and use synthetic. The car is fun to drive, convertible hood works well. Great engine. Sufficient power from the turbo. The suspension is not as good as the 3 series BMW but on the whole I am very pleasd. The car depreciates rapidly intitially making it a great used car bet."
saab,9-3,2002,Lindsay H., 11/07/2015,"Looks nice, but overall a Lemon...",3,"Bought this as my first used car purchase for college because of the look and price! I love this convertible and I get lot of compliments, but every few months there's something wrong with it. I love driving it around town and for work, but watch out for the cost of repairs. Anytime you need something worked on it, you're putting out anywhere from $500-$1500 for something to be special ordered and fixed. If you have the money for the upkeep I'd say go for it, but otherwise stay away from this lemon.

saab,9-3,2002,dcross15, 05/02/2015,A Fantastic Saab,4,"Words cant describe how much I love this car. It is a classic high performance Saab, and anyone who's driven one knows how special they are. It is a true sleeper. There is nothing better then blowing away a GT Mustang in an old Saab. The interior is classic Saab, very comfortable. It's a future classic for sure. The Saab front wheel drive limits it in corners compared to an M3, but its still very capable, and you'll have no problem catching them on the straights. Very reliable too, just look out for vacuum leaks. The fact that it is electronically limited to 155 shows just how performance oriented this thing is. Just watch out for that torque steer in 1st gear. "

saab,9-3,2002,robg3176, 11/06/2009,Steel Gray Hunchback,4,"My wife called it a hunchback, so it is my Steel Gray Hunchback.  Was looking around for another car actually, and test drove it, didn't feel right, and the one I wanted was sold.  But I saw this one, and it had tint and a built in alarm.  I was looking for utility, such as a hatchback to lug things around. 4 doors too.  I also required better gas mileage since gas prices were sky rocketing.  Also, power with torque to go up hills and turns.  Alas, I test drove this 2002 Saab 9-3 SE: has leather seats, and more power than normal. It is a 4cylinder turbo auto, more economical than a 6cyl, with just as much power because of the turbo.  Driving it ever since and my wife and I love it."
saab,9-3,2002,JasonK, 11/10/2002,Love It !,4,"Prior to buying, I had researched 
the ""sport-luxury"" class thoroughly. 
What won me over was Saab's personality 
and the test drive. The car is very 
responsive, handles extremely well; the 
turbo lag can be mitigated by proper 
modulation of gas and clutch. The 
torque steer isn't that bad, but this 
is a car that requires driver 
attention. The workmanship is great, 
and the control surfaces are well 
designed and placed - a few inches away 
from the shifter or steering wheel. 
Seats are comfortable and supportive.  
Drove the car to Colorado this summer.  
The car was incredibly agile and fast 
on the winding, steep mountain roads, 
and well mannered on the interstates."
saab,9-3,2002,dkp, 11/28/2006,Been great,4,"Today I hit 120,000 on my Saab.  My repairs have totaled less than $1000;  brakes, temp gauge sensor, mass airflow sensor.  Love: acceleration, fuel economy, handling in snow/ice, cargo room.  Dislike: rear passenger room, cupholders, pedal placement (too close together for my clodhoppers).  Also dislike having to move the front seats up to fold the rear seats flat."
saab,9-3,2002,VIGGEN LOVER, 04/30/2010,"Viggen, a classic sleeper car",4,"Amazing car. Engineered like no other. Find a good honest mechanic and you will be fine. Avoid GM like the plague. Use resources for parts and advice and learn to turn a wrench. In no time you will know more about your car than the harried GM mechanics who mistake it for a Sunfire. A few mods and PRESTO! you have a 400 hp fire breathing monster. In my experience, this is an incredibly well thought out car which is engineered like no other."
saab,9-3,2002,vonkruize, 09/14/2008,Never Again Will I Buy a Saab!,1,"My car has only 54,000 miles and the engine is shot. It fell victim to the ""Saab oil sludge problem"" that so many other 9-3's and 9-5's from this era have succumbed to (Google ""Saab oil sludge"" and read all about it).  Long story short, Saab admitted the oil sludge accumulation is due to an engine defect, NOT consumer negligence, and they ""extended coverage"" on '99-'03 9-3's and 9-5's. What they don't tell you is that you're not eligible for coverage unless you can produce oil change receipts for the entire  life of the car. So for those, like myself, who bought their car used, you're essentially fresh out of luck. It's either pony up $6000 for a new engine or scrap it for parts."
saab,9-3,2002,Dave, 08/06/2008,So much potential but alas !!,3,"2002 9-3 SE auto hatch with 125K. Loads of power in a practical package - especially in Sport mode. Best driver's seat ever! Would be a keeper but for constant repairs (antenna mast; squeaky brakes; center exhaust pipe; shocks; CPS; alternator; etc etc) and premium gas! Thank goodness the new engine cassette was a recall! Too bad, I guess they were right when they said SAAB stands for Swedish Auto Always Broken. 2009 Mazda 6 or Accord will take the 9-3's place in the garage. Sushi for herring I guess."
saab,9-3,2002,Zacharyzoosh, 06/14/2009,Saab is my favorite,4,"I've owned about 4 9-3s, as I move a lot, and will sell my car before every move. I always buy these. They are one hundred percent reliable for me, and they're fast. Also, I drove my most recent 2002 9-3 from WA to ID and back, and I got 35mpg on the highway for real, no joke!!! So I think they should change the average fuel economy on here. You only get 25 mpg (lowest I've seen) when you're driving in city, using the turbo all day. I give this car an over all 9 out of 10. The only brand I like better then Saab is Lexus!"
saab,9-3,2002,Gullable, 01/30/2008,From dream to nightmare,3,"This was my dream car until I bought one (used). It's fun to drive, but not at all the luxury car I expected it to be. Over $1500 spent in repairs in 1 year on a 6 year old car with under 60K miles: alternator, exhaust pipe, headliner clips, headlights (always dim, have to replace every 3 months), digital display fading, dash cracked, cupholder broke off, irritating squealing noise from AC fan, humming sound from glove box, roof channels rainwater into my lap, emblems are faded. Payments are too high to be this disappointed. An extended warranty is a must with this car."
saab,9-3,2002,Lee, 03/01/2002,We'll miss you when you're gone!,5,"The most important selling point for the 9-3 is its personality (i.e, quirkiness). The handling is very good on my new 9-3 SE with excellent steering and lots of power from the turbo 2.0 liter engine(although the secret is to click on the ""sport"" button which gives added power.)  The 9-3 excels in terms of comfort as the Saab seats are outstanding and the controls are easy to see, reach and understand."
saab,9-3,2002,Steven Patriarca, 01/02/2007,Saab 2002 vintage,5,The car is dependable and solid. The body style on the 2002 93 SE is vintage. This car with 30200 miles on it and Saab Certified is like driving a new car. I also had replaced all four tires in 6/2006 with factory Pirellis since I had basically just bought the car out of my lease agreement and would be driving it a while. Prior to purchase from my lease the dealership also did all the 30k service at about 21k miles. The 2002 93 SE has every available option one could ask for including the cold weather package and traction control. The traction control is necessary due to the high performance tires. 
saab,9-3,2002,shay127, 03/06/2012,**CAR IS A SOUR LEMON**,1,"I purchased my '02 Saab 9-3 used and right out the car lot, it was problem after problem. It started with having to get the front right wheel bearing fixed, then the right headlight went out twice, shortly after I had to get the heating coil fixed (cold air blowing), then the air stopped working. Car stopped 3 months later on the expressway (found out I needed another fuel pump) got it fixed, 3 months later, I had to replace the Starter, left wheel bearing, control arm & ball joints on drivers side, CV Shaft, Spring Coil Sensor for Check Engine light, Brake Pads & Rotors, but the biggest problem is a Starting Issue.

It had all the reliability issues everyone talks about, including the sump oil problem.
It was totaled last month when someone hit it while it was parked.
I looked at other cars, and ended up buying the exact same car again (except stick instead of auto), now at 80k miles.
They're as spacious as a small wagon, very quick and great handling, heated leather seats, premium sound, climate control, sunroof, power everything, 30+ mpg, and the style of a classic suit from a vintage store.
All for under $6,000.
Irresistible."
saab,9-3,2002,SaabMe, 01/04/2010,Design Perfection - Handles like new,5,Just purchased a mint condition used 2002 9-3SE. This is an amazing car. While it is small and handles nimbly it has generous room for 4 plus the huge hatch area. Mileage so far has been mid-30s mpg. Amazing that they could build a fast and efficient car 8 years ago. At 205 hp this car has as almost the same power as my 2001 Boxster.

my 9-3!"
saab,9-3,2002,CEN19, 06/16/2005,The non-conformist,4,"Such a neat car.  Despite being replaced in 2003 by a newer model, this generation of the 9-3 still turns heads (especially after a wash and wax). Build quality is very good, and the cabin materials are all high quality. Interior controls are a model of Swedish design efficiency.  Friends with an Audi and a BMW say the Saab's leather is much better than what they have in their vehicles.  Torque steer is obvious under hard acceleration from a stop, but on the highway, this car can fly.  Midrange passing power is awesome.  Braking is equally good.  Reliability has been good - only a few problems which were covered under warranty. This car has never left me stranded.  "

The bottom line is SAAB's turbo engines rule. It dont matter how you cut it !! and by the way I love the exterior styling with the hatch back, its SAAB's unique finger-print and its highly functional, its a sports car, its almost a station wagon its great for a family and it cranks 230 bhp from a 4 cylinder engine that can easily be tuned to produce 300 bhp.

This tops it all, I woke up at 1:30 am saw strange lights coming from my driveway to discover the hazards  were flashing.  I tried everything and could not shut them off, looked for fuses etc.. had to take it to a SAAB recommended mechanic near my home and his comments the SAAB is the worst car for the money and be prepared to continually pay for repairs... the repair cost was unbelievable.

saab,9-3,2002,BMV, 01/06/2009,Fun car with lots of storage,4,"I've owned this Saab for 2 and a half years. Purchased it used with 58k miles. It will reach 90k soon. Very fun to drive. Turbo lag is minimal. Feels taut at high speeds, nice steering feedback.  But wait, this is a family car. The trunk is huge for strollers, golf clubs and oversized stuffed animals from the in-laws. Pulled the hatch cover off recently and packed it to the window for a week long trip to the mountains.  It is a quirky Euro car though. Strange issues like Purge Valve throwing CEL codes, bad crank position sensor stranding my wife when the engine compartment got hot (would not start, the fix was to squirt cold water at it). Find yourself a Saab specialist you can trust."
saab,9-3,2002,2-years Saab owner, 11/29/2003,I give up,3,"The car definately falls short in its 
structural regidity (convertible only). 
Therefore, you are bounced all over the 
place on bumpy roads - honestly I feel 
more comfortable riding my skies on 
bumps than the Saab convertible.

Also the general interior setting 
becomes enoying very quickly. There is 
no cetral lock, and the romote car key 
only works from about three (3) feet of 
the car - funny you would find many of 
us Saab owners sticking the key to our 
chin to make the door open or lock from 
ten twenty feet of the car.

Having said all of this, I am going to 
sell this car this spring and by 
another German or even a Japanese car."
saab,9-3,2002,Ric C, 04/12/2002,Steel Gray Beauty,5,"A wonderful car to drive.  The Turbo

engine has plenty of power.  I live in 
Utah and it takes the mountains with 
ease.  The Saab $269 per month 
lease is incredible.  The rent charge 
is under $14 for three years.   
Basically a 0% interest 3 year loan.  I 
will purchase this car at the lease 
end.  It will be worth  about $2000 
more than I paid for it."

is not pleasant driving as there is no 
ergonomic considerations for the driver.

The seat is hard and one must contort 
to press the gas pedal, with the 
drivers seat aimed at the left fron 
wheel and the gas pedal crammed against 
the transmission tunnel.  oh yes, the 
seat is hard and doesn't soften any 
with use.

In acceleration the tires break loose 
from the pavement due to undersized 
rims.  In cornering... you think of a 
ride at Six Flags.

The stock sound system is just adequate.

First gear is too short and over rev's, 
once the turbo lag kicks in."

when I saw what they were leasing for I 
had to check one out. I am glad I did 
because they had $3500 in rebates until 
the end of July. Had trouble getting a 
5 speed because no other dealer wanted 
to make a trade. The car fits me like a 
glove. It is quicker than everything 
else I have ever driven. The suspension 
is stiff but still compliant. Very 
little torque steer unless you get on 
it when pulling away from a stop when 
making a left or right turn. I bought a 
midnight blue 5 speed Saab 9-3 SE 4 
door hatch with the premium package and 
heated seats. Tons of room in the hatch

Turbo engine is fast & smooth, the Auto 
S function is a blast to use. Interior 
& exterior fit & finish are among the 
best in the industry. This is the last 
year for the current body, the new 9-3

It's that quiet and that smooth.  When I first bought it I'd be going along the freeway at 60 and notice that the tach was at 5000 and I was in 2nd gear.  The gears are VERY long in this car.  The Viggen driver's seat is the best, most comfortable seat anywhere including Buster chairs and couches at home. I've gotten used to the torque steer which adds a quirky challenge to stay earthbound.  It reminds me of the fishtailing 1980's Porsches I've had, about which the reviewers used to say, ""Fishtailing off a cliff is part of the 911's charm""  "

quirky as the current one."

The handling is great and the turbo pickup is excellent. This is my first SAAB and am enjoying every moment of ownership. The pricing is so good on used SAABs that you can't go wrong. If your on the fence just do it..buy the car and have fun. Life is too short not to enjoy a little topless driving in the sun.  They say once you own a SAAB you'll own another...I'm starting to believe it now. Do your homework, make sure the car you buy is of quality and go for it!  "
saab,9-3,2002,Miles Parker, 04/09/2002,Viggen underappreciated for price,5,"At list, the Viggen isn't a very good 
deal, but at the price we paid, its 
awesome. We bought our Viggen for a bit 
more than the price of a loaded Maxima 
or Passat, or a pretty base A4.

For that we got a car with huge 
interior, gorgeous styling, awesome 
acceleration, rewarding and engaging 
handling, really well thought out 
details, and that lovely Saab leather 
smell.

For 10k less than an S4 Avant less we 
got similar performance, much more 
room, and a unique car.

Yes, it is an older design, and there 
are some quirks, but you can take 
advantage of that and make a screaming 
deal. Remember when you're comparing 
cars to compare at the price you'll 
actually end up paying."

couldn't imagine anything else. I was

service manager at the Saab dealership, 
asked me to take a look just for 
comparison-sake. My plan was to spend 
30 minutes at the Saab dealership, and 
then go buy my new BMW. Well,I never 
made it to the BMW dealership. Superior 
engine kick off the line, quieter with 
the top up or down, better gas milage, 
much more spacious front and back, more 
trunk space, more gadgets standard, and 
much more unique. By the way, the price 
of the comparably equipped BMW

and loved it.  It is the quickest off 
the line and the top is great.  The car 
has no rattles and wind noise is 
nonexistent.  I drove the Volvo C70 to 
compare and it was slower, handled less 
well, rattled and was noisey with the 
top up.  The back seats are useful, 
unlike any other car I considered. It 
is a great luxury sports car and the 
price is reasonable."

electrical components in the car (that's what the dealer has said). My 
problem is not severe but a friend has such a severe problem that the car will 
not start. This problem is surprising since GM has been installing onstar on 
it's vehicles for many years."
saab,9-3,2002,cliffy, 05/13/2002,"Exceptional Value, Fun for GTI people",5,"Before purchasing the 9-3; I considered
the  Volvo V40, the Benz Coupe, the BMW
325, and Audi A4. I purchased the 9-3
after the test drive. Loads of power and
acceleration. Top end power was a little
low, but how often do you really get
into triple digits? For those of us
raised on GTi's in the 80s and 90s, this
is a well-qualified replacement."

car -- especially the convertible which 
is sooo much fun to drive with the top 
down.  Only drawback to owning the car: 
dealing with Saab Corporation!  The car 
may have alot of ""soul"" but Saab 
Corporation clearly does NOT given my 
experience.  This is one second time 
Saab owner who still loves Saab cars 
but am sorely disappointed by the 
company who clearly operates on ""rules

me on the phone).  Obviously, ""profit""

luxury sedan, I looked at several 
vehicles, including BMW and Volvo.  I 
chose the Saab just because of the test 
drive.  If you are at all waivering on 
what type of car and the Saab is a 
little out of your price range, don't 
test drive it.  You'll have to leave 
with it, whether you can afford it or 
not!  I'm surprised at it's speed with 
so little horsepower."
saab,9-3,2002,Seanc, 05/31/2002,Fun and Fast,4,"This is my 2nd Saab purchased in one 
year. Although the design is older (8 
years), this car still has soul and 
class. Very fast, sure handling and 
practical for a convertible (trunk is a 
good size, 4 usable seats, 30 mpg). 

I leased the car, but if all goes well, 
this is a keeper for many years."
saab,9-3,2002,FAB, 06/07/2002,Viggen Convertible,5,"For those looking for a ""true"" sport 
convertible with a real backseat, the 
Viggen should most definately be 
considered. The car is fast, well made, 
with very good space and fuel efficient 
to boot.  I live in New England which 
is Saab territory, but Viggens are 
rarely seen on roads (I like that)Very 
much a 4season convertible(though,watch 
out for bad weather given the fat 
tires) & still fun to drive with top 
up. Also did the Flight School which 
was a total blast. I got a very good 
deal, which made my decision easy 
when combined with attributes of 
Viggen vs. competitiors (BMW, 
Volvo, MERC, US)."
saab,9-3,2002,seanbarrett02, 07/03/2002,Get one before they are gone!,4,"I got this car a few weeks ago and it is the best car for the money.  It has the 
type of luxury and comfort that you would expect from a $40k car and the 
performance to match it.  There aren't many left as they are clearing the 
inventories for the new 2003 model, so get yours now."
saab,9-3,2002,Frequent buyer, 08/16/2002,Frequent Car Buyer,5,"I bought this car for my wife 
replacing a 4 years old BMW 328i. We 
feel we have lost 10% in peformance 
and gained 35% in styling and 
pleasure. The Viggen convertable is a 
fun car that can well please both my 
wife and myself. Also drove a 9-3 
converatble (not Viggen). There is a 
world of difference. I would not have 
traded my BMW for a regular 9-3."
saab,9-3,2002,rsherman, 08/19/2002,"Shake, Rattle, & Knocks",3,"While I thoroughly enjoy the ride and performance, I am sorely disappointed 
in the interior fit and finish.  From delivery, we have had seriously annoying 
interior clunks, rattles and the like.  This car has made more noise than a 10 
year old Rambler American I owned in the early 70s.  Not what I expected 
when I paid $27k for a supposed quality vehicle."
saab,9-3,2002,driver dave, 09/19/2002,Saab's the one,5,"Leased a saab 9-3 in August and I am 
extremely pleased with the price and 
performance.  My previous vehicle was a 
BMW 740i which was flawless.  However, 
performance was delivered with a 
premium price.  The saab gives top 
performance at a reasonable price 
(especially with the rebate).  As you 
would expect, the ride is not 
comparable (comfort wise)however, the 
saab is not in the same social class.  
Love the saab, highly recommend it."
saab,9-3,2002,From BMW to SAAB, 09/30/2002,Viggen,4,"This is my forst SAAB after driving 
several BMW's (All 3 series). The 
viggen shows a far better built an 
finish than the BMW. Viggen however, 
is not as tamed as the BMW. It 
requires driver attention. This car 
can deliver a lots of performance - 
but make sure that your driving is 
also up to the task.

Altima/Maxima, even a V6 Accord or 
Camry; this car is definately worth a 
test drive.  Saab always offers factory 
incentives that effectively reduce the 
MSRP LOWER than these LESSER cars.  The 
9-3 with 5-speed is selling around $24-
25K USD.  The price of a fairly loaded 
V6 Altima is $28K and your stuck with 
an Altima.  The Saab 9-5, contrary to 
what most believe, start around $28-29K 
with the incentives.  Both are worth 
the time of a quick test drive.  "

the Saab the best because they gave us 
a great lease deal and we did not have 
to mess around with all of those Option

you will need right out of the gate.  
It's fast, nice-looking (midnight

(Leather, Power Everything, Sunroof), 
and reliable.  I drive on the highway

a 5-speed.  I enjoy the benefits of

going on, I said, why not, they are 
cool looking cars and they fit with my 
snobby job in banking. Let me tell you, 
I had a ball testing this thing. From 
the ease of the convert. top to the 
turbo boost and the little S button for 
extra speed. I bought a 2002 model that

Lots of rattles.  Had to take the car 
in to the dealership several times to 
fix a rattle in the back seat.  Finally 
they were able to fix it after the 
third try.  Turned out it was a bolt 
that the factory hadn't tightened.  
Performance wise it's been great.  
However, already had to replace my 
breaks two years into my lease.  Love 
the Turbo button.  I had a Cadillac

Plastics inside vehicles also make 
rattling noise at high speed but 
manageable.  Mine's manual, and so far 
at 68K over 2.5 years, I haven't had 
any problems with it.  I drive mostly 
on the highways and drive fast.  Starts

Suspension is quirky, yet entertaining.  It handles corners very well.  It's absolutely beautiful in black.  The hatch has a plethora of room for anything.  Rides quietly.

In over 3 years of owning this car, outside of normal maintenance, which by the way was included in the lease, I have had no problems. Tires and brakes need replacement at 27K to 30K miles. Interior had minor integrity issues, but again, all covered when brought in for service.  The interior and top squeak in the winter months; I guess to be expected in a convertible.  The back seat is spacious for a convertible and one of the main reasons I bought this car.  I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a nice, reliable 4 passenger convertible.  If looking for a more sport riding convertible, go with the Viggen or Bimmer convertible"

The turbo engine makes up for the VTEC engine that I had.  The visability is great, as there are limited blind spots.  Having the ignition in the floor is odd, but it is a neat feature.

And the reason I ended up selling it for 500 dollars after having this heartache of a car with 80 K miles was the oil sludge issue. When I was in high school I had a five hundred dollar Pinto that had this bucket beat.

saab,9-3,2003,Jaime Perez, 04/17/2016,2003 Saab 9-3 Linear 2.0T,5,"Great car! This car is bulletproof if properly maintained. I stayed on top of maintance and the car never let me down. At 230,000 miles I drove the car cross country coast to coast all the time without any fear of breakdowns. I even cruised at triple digits out in the desert with no problems. Engine still strong at that mileage. Frequent oil changes highly recommended to prevent sludge in these engines and to prevent turbo failure. Car still has original transmission at 230,000 miles. The car feels very light and corners like a sports car. These Saabs do have electrical problems but the only ones I encountered were passengers door lock stopped working and the high beam shutter in the Xenon headlights stopped working so no more high beams. I would definitely recommend getting the daytime running lights disabled at a shop that specializes in Saabs because they come from the factory with the daytime running lights which leave the headlights on all the time whenever the car is on. If your car is equipped with Bi Xenon headlights like mine was you don't want them on whenever the car is on because the bulbs are expensive and if the high beam shutter stops working like it did in mine then you're looking at $750 a headlight for replacement. Also check the Coil Springs on all four corners because they tend to rust due to poor coating from the factory which can lead them to breaking which is not good if it happens while driving. The car gave me an impressive 39mpg on the highway during summer days and 34mpg during winter on the highway. The car gave me 24 mpg in the city. The car has more than enough power for everyday day driving. The car is amazing in the snow and it's a great cold weather car. Never got stuck in snow and drove it in multiple snowstorms where there was so much snow that only rigs and trucks were on the roads. The car also survived every day cold starts in -20 degree weather never failing to start. I will definitely be buying another Saab in the future. Great European cars. Stay on top of maintance and you will get a car that is reliable, sporty, good looking, good on gas, great driver in any weather, turbo power, handles, great cargo space, room for 5 people, luxury features for the year of the car! There's a reason why there's so many of these on the roads especially in the northeast!!

saab,9-3,2003,whasaab, 09/22/2013,"first sight fell in love, still loving strong",4,"At first, I was very hesitant about buying this car because I read many unsatisfying reviews on Saab.
However, bought 2003 9-3 vector in Feb 2013 under 6k, looked new inside and out, one owner and no accident.
Checked with Saab if the car had any mechanical service done.
All the recalls had been taken care of and no other mechanical issues.
After 8 months putting over 10k still feels like a new car.
But make sure you use premium gas and full synthetic oil.
Not using premium grade gas will give you check engine light.
But don't panic, it will go away if you put premium.

My $6k saab looks better and runs better than brand new camrys or accords .. love this car."
saab,9-3,2003,merashad, 06/14/2011,Loveable but complicated!!,4,"I love the car for it's design and drivibility. The car responds well if maintained. The complicated portion of the car is its electrial and quirky engine light. One day the car is fine and the next, the electrial system can just quit without warning. No, mishaves to complete shut off. If you are looking to purchase this car you'll need to have on hand about $1500 due to abrupt problems."
saab,9-3,2003,geek, 10/02/2009,Objective 2003 Saab convertible review.,4,"Quiet (yes a convertible) solid feel, comfortable seats, highly responsive engine, reasonable few blind spots, good MPG.  Some odd features but not annoying and something Saab is noted for. The torque steer nonsense you read about is something that average drivers will never notice or care about.  This is nice riding and driving car, that was a great purchase.  It has all the options that you would expect in a car that sold and sells in this price range.  The higher than normal depreciation means you can buy an expensive car for less. The cost of repair is not out of line with any high end car.  BTW the trunk is functional for trips, the back seats go down to extend the storage.   "
saab,9-3,2003,disasterdawg, 05/25/2013,Used 2003 9-3 Convertible,3,"Bought this car with 89,xxx miles on it, AUTOMATIC
I knew it needed a few cosmetic items and tires, but was a value for $4400. Solid car that is fun to drive. The AC blows so cold I had to turn it down on a 90+ degree day. Items are simple to fix like the DIC and fluid for the covnertible top. Lots of parts on eBay and videos on YouTube to help. Is quick and responsive. The Sweeds know nothing of cup holders though. The car will throw trouble codes every day. Buy a scanner when you buy a Saab. Nothing to worry about, most are harmless warnings and can be fixed without huge money. The DIC (coil pack) is the common failure for most codes, new is $500"
saab,9-3,2003,VW to Saab, 09/11/2009,Caught the Swedish Bug,5,"When my daughter needed a car for school, reluctantly I gave her my beloved Jetta and purchased a used Saab 93 convertible. It's now my beloved Saab. Amazing car!! Purchased with 46K miles already on it, the Saab performs beautifully. A heavier car than the Jetta, the steering is only slightly less responsive, but you can feel the weight of this car. It's solid. Comfy and sexy! The mileage - near 30 mpg highway. The car has its quirks - a wonky gas gauge and that damn SID that reads like Braille - but these are easy to overlook when you hit that turbo and the car responds without a hiccup. No maintenance woes to date. Amazing since the car was in a flood 4 years ago. So far, fantastic!"
saab,9-3,2003,mrdotkom, 02/09/2013,"Best car for the Money, If you can fix it yourself",4,"If you're not a mechanic you bought the wrong car. If, like myself, you enjoy working on your car and don't mind changing ignition coils on the side of the highway in a hail storm you can get a great value on this car.

I bought this car after the previous owner failed to diagnose the blown ignition cassette. After ~$150 bucks I got a great deal on it. The CEL lights most people are reporting are as a result of non-OE specific spark plugs.

Most people spend too much money at the shop and not enough time learning about proper maintenance and service. This car has never been in the shop since I've owned it and for the next 50k miles I expect it to be somwhere between my garage and the highway"
saab,9-3,2003,carz240, 01/19/2012,I love this Sport Sedan,4,"After I sold my old car I wanted an improvement. Something with xenon lights, leather, automatic windows and sun roof, and it had to be relatively fast.

After looking for 3 or 4 months I found a 2003 Saab 93 2.0t automatic.
I went over to test drive it that night at the owners house and I instantly wanted it.
I ended up buying it that night, I didnt know much about Saab and if I did I would have bough the Vector/Aero or the Arc. 

I wish Saab wasn't in this problem right now, after owning this car for the past 6 months I want to be a Saab guy forever.

Im 20 and I am in love with my Saab,
I have never had any major issues.
Just little things here and there.

I highly reccomend the 93"
saab,9-3,2003,thartz, 07/29/2013,"200,000 and going strong",4,"This is my 2nd Saab and it's just as bullet proof as the first. I picked this ARC with the 6 speed manual because of the motor. They are amazing. I average 27 mpg and 31-33 on the highway. I got the car with 92k on it because I was so comfortable with the drive train and it's not disappointed. I'm just below 200k now and put on over 700 miles this weekend. Sure there are little issues but it's 10 model years old and I paid under $7,000 for it 5 years ago so i can't possibly complain. 

The rear main seal has a slow leak that the gasket sealers can't quite stop. The gas cap doesn't seal properly so the check engine light is on but all in all, it's been great."
saab,9-3,2003,aemadian, 05/28/2015,Why the bad Reputation?,4,"This car is fun to drive and has a great powerful engine. You always have the confidence to take on any car on the road and get ahead fast. Great MPG too even-though it is a turbo car. I have never had any engine and transmission problems with my car. I have only changed the oil when service warning comes on. Handling is great too, almost like a BMW but front wheel drive characteristics. Radio went bad once because a really smart person jumped the battery and fried the amp. You take care of it, it takes care of you. It's just false word of mouth that gave this car bad rep."
saab,9-3,2003,leviphx, 06/20/2014,Honest Review,4,"I bought this car used with 63k miles on it and haven't regretted it a day since.
Knowing the history of these cars however, I made sure I had an independent mechanic familiar with the brand take a look at it before I made an offer (easily worth the $150 dollars). I don't want to put anyone down, but I believe that at least half of the poor reviews this car gets are due to A) Poor maintenance by/no knowledge of previous ownership, or B) Poor maintenance by current owner. Love this car and it will love you back, simple as that.
And don't buy a performance (or any other) car without a thorough inspection.
Tho people I suppose have been burned by a bad car regardless of their caution I guess"
saab,9-3,2003,jimb, 03/25/2009,"Quick, Comfortable & Reliable",4,"I am very pleased with the combination of power and fuel economy the Saab 9-3 convertible provides with the 2,0 liter turbo-charged engine. My 9-3 is equipped with an automatic transmission and delivers 20 plus mpg city and 28 mpg highway - not bad for a comfortable, powerful and fun to drive convertible. The 9-3 delivers more than adequate acceleration, and plenty of reserve power for merging and passing. Ride & handling are  superb, albeit with a bit of cowl flex on less than glass smooth roads. Comfort is fantastic, thanks in part to some of the best seats in the business. Top operation couldn't be easier. Reliability thus far excellent! A very nice automobile."
saab,9-3,2003,dipper94, 05/08/2013,Great first car,4,"It's a blast to drive. I highly recommend it, however a few words of caution. You're going to have some problems with the electric lock system, but other than that it will perform really well. It's incredibly safe and incredibly reliable. 

Before you get behind the wheel of this car though, make sure you understand how a turbocharger works and how to mantain one. More importantly know how to drive a car equipped with one, they drive differently than naturally aspirated cars (Cars without turbochargers or superchargers). 

It's a great first car for your teen. It's my first car, go it used for 5.5 grand with 50k miles on it. It's driven me reliably for the past year. It also looks great."
saab,9-3,2003,jimb, 11/20/2008,"Fun, Fast & Comfortable Swedish Style!",5,"My 2003 Saab 9-3 Convertible is a very reliable, comfortable, well-built automobile. Power from the turbo-charged 2.0 liter 4 is outstanding, as is the gas mileage - 20 mpg city, 28 highway. The seats are superb - I've driven 10 hours non-stop in complete comfort. The 9-3 handles well and provides a smooth, quiet ride. The power top operates without a hitch, and driving with the top down is a great experience. I love the styling of the Saab inside & out, and the trunk is quite large for a convertible. The rear seat is most suitable for 2 children or smaller adults, as the convertible top does take up some space. Overall I rate the Saab a 9+ out of 10."

It always has something wrong with it. Saab will do nothing for me. They have the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. The say my car does not qualify for a buyback?

We purchased it from a friend who was the original owner and had most of their service records. It is easy for my 16 year old to change the oil and (although different) the filter as well. We will do the air and cabin filter and plugs in the next month, but this car runs like a top and we have had no problems after a little over 3,000 miles. It now has 147,500 miles on the odometer.

This model is a far cry from the old Saab. I too, have had issues with lights, engine light on, heat/cooler blower...just to name a few.  Even the 6 CD gave me issues.  I had the CD into the local dealer several times -- of course, never acted up while at the dealer.  Finally (200 miles out of warranty) it acted up -- and they were refusing to honor the warranty!! Gave me a price of $2000 to fix.  I was on the phone quite a bit with Saab, when they finally agreed to fix it.  Funny thing, the dealer only fixed $1100 of the $2000 -- said the other didn't need fixing!   "

However, it's an attractive automobile with many standard features which would be options on another vehicle.  I was concerned about it being a 4 cyl, but the Turbo gives it plenty of guts.  Additionally, I have owned this car for over a year now without any cosmetic or mechanical issues.  It's fun to drive with very little road noise.  "

saab,9-3,2003,drfabulous, 02/23/2013,Great VALUE,4,"Still love this car, even after 130k miles. Looks and drives like it did back in 2005, easy on gas (average high 20's), and has NEVER had a major issue. Like others have said, it's a car that is unique and requires a little more work to repair, but if you're handy and willing to do research, it's simple. Case in point- fixed my power steering leak for $10 in under an hour with nothing but common hand tools when a shop wanted $600, and I'm by no means a mechanic.

Bottom line- its fun to drive, good gas mileage, nice enough to drive to meet with clients, and people always look at it going ""I've never been in a SAAB""."
saab,9-3,2003,Larry DeVivo, 06/06/2006,2003 9-3 Linear,4,"As a life long Saab driver, I can only say I am extremely disappointed in this vehicle.  I have been in the repair shop 18 times over 3 years and have not been satisfied that any resolution is in sight with newer models.  On a positive note, the handling is fun & what you would expect from Saab.  The fuel economy has been good.  If not for the repeatedly ridiculous problems from a supposed new car, I would not be writing such a harsh review.  I am actually looking at buying a different vehicle for the first time in my life... one that does not need the constant work this car has needed.

I was at first apprehensive about getting a FWD but I was pleasantly surprised once I got behind the wheel. While it's still a tad not as fun as my previous ride, it surprisingly comes close to it, for the heavy car that it is! Fuel economy is miles better than my ex and its way more comfy. Not sure about the reliability though.  After a month the passenger side window stopped working and I had to get the entire rail changed. Other than that, its been sweet but it's been only 5 months. Very good boot space and spacious at the back. The worst thing about this car is the stereo system, my 150 dollar self installed HU in my ex is WAY better."

It does not vibrate and drives new even at 150,000 miles.

The tires (Pirelli Rosso Asimmetrico) that come standard on this model generally need to be replaced after 10-12 months.

Both headlight assemblies had to be replaced at 20K miles because they malfunctioned.  The gas gauge is inaccurate. GM used too many inexpensive parts to improve margins on the Saabs and the negative effects of this poor decision making trickled down to the consumer and dealer network - who in turn just services the car and bills the expenses for labor and warranty repair back to GM - does this make any sense?  Use quality parts and make a good car. "

The Saab has a sporty, stiff drive which makes driving an enjoyable experience.  I will not buy a different type of car, my Saab is the greatest car I have ever owned."

homework, and so far am happy w/ my 
choice.  The car's got great styling, 
power and features.  JD's latest survey 
seemed to call out the quality of the 
electronics.  Admittedly and as 
expected, the car was delivered w/ a 
few bugs that I need to take in to have 
fixed.  The radio on/off sticks and 
the ""nxt"" button on the steering wheel 
doesn't work well.  Overall, I feel the 
new design is strong and is positioned 
to be a legitimate player in the 
sport/premium mid-size segment."

the '02 9-5, the Audi A4 and the 330i.  
None of these cars can match the

Sexy design, awesome handling, 
tremendous mileage and incredibly 
enhanced pickup and speed, this car is 
nothing but fun to drive.  The car will 
blow anything else in it's class out of

Transmission and radiator went out @ 43k and now the check engine light is on @ 46k ($900 repair). I worry about if I will make it to work everyday.
saab,9-3,2003,Steve, 10/15/2009,Never Again,3,"Bought this car brand new in '03.   Decided on this instead of the BMW 330 Convertible because of price and the BMWs are everywhere.  What a mistake!  While fun to drive, it has been a maintenance nightmare compared to any other car I've ever driven.  Fuel pump failure (huh?) at 56K, CLUTCH at 70K, A/C compressor at 48K, wheel bearing at 80K, Ignitor Coil at 80K.  Compare to my '86 325:  original clutch at 150K; my '83 Tercel: original clutch at 150K.  I work with a guy that has an '02 9-5 - same problems.  No wonder the resale value of Saabs stinks.  Stay away from Saab!"
saab,9-3,2003,EuroCarDriver, 03/03/2010,Think Twice,3,"Bought this vehicle with 95k and it was a one owner vehicle that was dealer serviced, so thought it would be a good buy.  Have had a Saab in the past ('92 900 turbo) which was a great vehicle.  This '03 model, not so much.  Day 3, engine light came on.  Something to do with emissions.  The grill has even fallen out driving down the road.  Twice!  There's been other issues too.  Right now the water pump is out.  I got tired of the car and it's been sitting for a year now.  GM ruined what was once a great vehicle.  Hopefully Saab will go back to it's former glory now that GM is out of the picture."

The car quickly became very uncomfortable and Saab is the worst manufacturer to admit that they have very poor design and build quality. If someone wants to sell you a Saab or even give you one, run, even a free one would end up costing a fortune! They have had to tow this car and loan or rent us one more often than we have driven ours!"

Man, I love the way this car handles

saab,9-3,2003,Eliza, 09/04/2006,This car breaks a lot,3,"I purchased my SAAB because the test drive was great and the car had great features and design.  The turbo engine is a lot of fun, and the interior and exterior are beautiful.   After 3 months, while driving in Manhattan, we had our first engine problem.  The car was towed to the dealer at no charge and we were given a replacement.  After that, the car has been in the shop at least once every 3- 4 months for various problems.  Computer problems are the most common, but the most surprising was the complete tearing appart of the clutch, something not even the dealer had seen in 20 year old cars.  This is very odd as the car stays in a garage and we drive very slowly around NY streets."
saab,9-3,2003,JRT, 04/20/2007,Look at this before you buy!!!,3,"In short:  for the love of God stay away from a Saab!!  My Saab has been involved in 6 separate recalls, needed a new transmission due to mechanical failure (out 2 weeks), lost two batteries which requires a tow (no kidding), I had no idea what ""turbo-lag"" was until I tried to pull out into traffic with this thing and the service teams have been less than stellar.

saab,9-3,2003,Dan A., 06/05/2009,Never Again,2,"Where do I begin? My ""latest"" issue is that although the electrical system is working, the car wont start! The Saab mechanic informs me that it ""may"" be the started, but maybe not. He can replace it for $700+, but if it's not the problem, I'm out the money! The leather seats are worn out. The fan for the a/c stays on for an extra 15 minutes after I shut off the car. The car rattles way too much. The seals on the back window are coming off. Oh, and the motor for the passenger seat is gone and now starting to go on the drivers side as well. They inform me that the motor is over $700! I can easily say that I will not buy a Saab OR a GM auto ever again. Haven't met many happy Saab owners lately."

The final straw came, when the car would not accelerate past 50 mph, later traced to the Particulate Filter. This would have cost us another £2000.

I won't reiterate what everyone else has said about electrical, rattle, peeling dash and overall gremlin nightmare about this car.  GM has replaced the engine three times under extended warranty.  Because of the new engine and all the time and money I've put into this car, I'm holding on until my warranty runs out and the car dies on the side of the road.  It's very interesting to see all the high reliability marks if you scroll back to 2003 when the car first hit the road.  Except for one person who had high mileage early on.  Everyone else scores it a 1! "

touches from GM. I have owned Saabs for 
years, and loved their quirky

hatchback design. No more. This car is 
built on the same platform as a Pontiac

it."

cheap-looking and full of plastic. 
Worse, it has none of the Saab 
individuality or the wonderful, unique 
silhouette that made the hatchback 
synonymous with Saab for decades. GM 
has the ability to ruin anything. 
Unfortunately it has its clutches on

Had to replace all 4 rotors and sets of pads, crankshaft positioning sensor (twice), oil pressure sensor, and the head gasket was blown, this was all after the place I bought it from said it was in tip-top condition. Strut mounts were noisy (known issue), headlights were too dim, vehicle rode like a tank, gas mileage only around 21 - 23 mpg HIGHWAY. I owned this vehicle less than a year. After this and my Audi, I will never buy another European vehicle."

We quickly began to get use of the factory warranty and have already gotten nearly $2,000 of use off an extended warranty we purchased.  This is, by far, the most un-reliable car I have ever owned.  The electronics dont reliably work (Saab consistently updates the program which amounts to a patch before the next issue), the CDs get stuck in the changer, there are countless rattles/squeaks, broken plastic junk on the interior, failed A/C Comp., failed alternator and now the check engine light is on.  The small 4 cylinder lacks torque and the car handles (bad) much like a family sedan."
saab,9-3,2003,Bob O'Keefe, 04/28/2009,Me too - never again!,3,I helped my son purchase a used Saab in January 2007 and with each year the repair costs just keep coming. In September of 2007 the check engine light came on with a total cost of $545 to fix. In February 2008 a new radiator cost $721. In December 2008 it cost $903 for a new window regulator and new blower motor. In April 2009 a tow charge of $105 and an estimated repair cost of $900 to fix after the car simply stopped running on the highway. With the latest fix the total repairs bills are over $3000 in 2 years and 2 months. What a piece of junk!

I satisfied.  After test driving the 
Audi A4 and BMW 3 series, I decided 
hands down on the Saab.  Not only is 
the interior more spacious than either 
car, but the exterior design has more 
attitude(this probaby stems from the 
fact that Saab has contracted BMW's(now 
ex) designer.) Not only is this New and 
refined Saab a great deal, but by 
driving one you set yourself apart from 
the masses who are conent with paying 
$5,000 more for the Audi or BMW.  My

the 9-3 for my 17 y/o son. Made the 
mistake by letting him choose 
out of the cars we tested. Car has a 
classy look but thatsthe only good 
thing. GM can't make luxury cars, 
Cadillac is the most dangerous luxury 
car on the road. 
Saab was a great car but GM has ruined 
that. Want real luxury and style look 
at one of the two best made luxury 
marques' small sedans, Volvo S60 or 
Mercedes C240. The prices of Volvo and 
Mercedes maybe more but it is worth it. 
Odd when an engine and driver's seat 
has to be replaced on a brand new car. 
Mercedes had a few problems with the 
4.3 liter engine but at least they 
handle the problem."

they are liars and have never stepped

I never had any electrical problems with it. I have about a 2 hour drive each day and it has suited well.

I still enjoy it and never had some of the mechanical problems that other '03 owners seem to have encountered. I enjoy driving the car and will probably buy a 9-3 again but hope to be able to keep this one going another few years at least--I don't use it much more than 7,500 miles a year and if I can avoid any major problems expect to hold it until it dies."

The biggest negative is the cost of repair.  I haven't had many (knock on wood) but those that I've had are expensive.  Then again, it's less expensive to than an Audi or BMW.  Second big complain is that the wheels are held on my bolts, not lugs.  All five need to be at proper torque for the wheel to balance.  Also, the wheel hub and bolt are softer metal, so I've already had to re-tap one wheel twice due to electric wrench happy mechanics."

You have to notice the sloped hood and clean exterior styling, a testament to Saabs new-age design. The interior is pretty roomy, but the paint can scratch off and some parts feel like cheap plastic was used. The CD changer works well as does the radio.   This car drives excellently, and using the sport shifter allows you to get some pretty solid acceleration times, with the turbochargers help though! Highway performance is EXCELLENT, and the car handles exceptionally especially when the ESP control is on. We even took it up to the mountains and it handles excellently even with front wheel drive."

There is a little more road noise than I care for and the stereo could be better, but these are minor issues. Not quite a 3-series or A4, but priced thousands $ less.  Overall, this is a fun to drive car and is very economical.  I would buy another one."
saab,9-3,2003,Travis Cole, 07/09/2009,Love it!,4,"I purchased my Saab used, I've had a couple issues but I still love the car.  It has enough get up and go, and to me is just a thrill to drive!  The only real problem I've had with the car is on 2 occasions there was a computer issue, the computer wasn't telling the car to shift gears basically.  The first time this happened it fixed itself after I restarted the car a few times.  The second time I had to have the computer reset at the dealership ($100) and they put in all the updated software.  I get tons of compliments on the car, and I get excited to drive it every time I get behind the wheel!"

It has been wonderful and only issues have been its common gnomes in the electrical work/displays (funny at times, annoying at others). Comfort is above par and makes daily long drives bearable. Turbo lag is certainly there, but as soon as it realizes that it's supposed to go, it does so with awesomeness. Plenty of power and fuel economy to boot. Overall, a wonderful car for my first dive into the luxury branded vehicles."

you in random directions.  I do like 
the power of the turbo but it's not

that it may have a few more GMesque 
tendancies, but that's because I 
believe Saab has a few more resources 
and idea pools to pick and choose 
from.  I am enjoying this car more than 
any other other car I've driven thus

This car is beautiful both inside and
out.  Some said its cheap and GM ruined
it, but if you read the automative
journals, this is the best car Saab ever
produced.
The linear model is fast enough for me.
 It accerlates quickly and gets up to
speed in seconds.  Handling is this cars
best attribute.  It simply carves up
twisty back roads.
The interior is laid out very well. 
There are a ton of features and the
profiler system is great.

edition with the same engine 210 turbo 
which was very impresive.  Love the 
design interior and exterior, the 
gadgets like the tire pressure 
monitor.  The new 9-3 might not be the 
best out there in the category with BMW 
and Audi but it is very close 
especially with that reaxes system.  In 
the end what made me choose it was the 
safety, still a young guy so my life is

saab,9-3,2003,M.P., 07/25/2003,vector,4,"This was a huge surprise from Saab.  
Six speed with good passing power.  
Perfect seats, could have used a bit 
more room in the rear and less trunk 
(it's huge).  "
saab,9-3,2003,Ganddi, 07/26/2003,Wish the electronics worked,4," I bought the Linear in Feb 03. I have 
every option on the car including 
the ""rare"" launch package.  My initial 
response to the car was very positive. 
However, since Feburary we had the car 
in for electronics problems 5 seperate 
times(mainly onstar).Our dealership, 
although responsive, seemed to be inept 
the first 4 times I graced there 
floors. Fianlly, after dealing with the 
GM and the service manager the problem 
appears to be 
resolved.fantastic.Cruising at 80 mph 
feels effortless, and unnoticed with 
how well the car rides.  However, I am 
basing that only on the few times I 
have driven the car since it seems to 
be in the shop more than I'm driving 
it. "
saab,9-3,2003,ftnss1, 07/26/2003,"Great, fun car!",4,"I've had my Arc almost 2 months now 
(3k miles).  I love driving it more 
and more every day.  Handling and grip 
are awesome for a sedan!  Acceleration 
is very brisk, despite slight turbo 
lag off the line.  I love the design, 
the comfort (great seats!), the on-
star system.  We'll see about 
reliability -- suffered minor stalling 
problem at very low speed, now 
apparently corrected by dealer 
reprogramming the computer; homelink 
garage opener doesn't work (for 
anyone, apparently); otherwise, no 
problems.  Great value for the money 
and reeaally fun to drive."
saab,9-3,2003,JCool, 07/27/2003,Be careful...,3,"After 1800 miles a new transmission 
unit was installed because the last 
one caused a loud grinding noise when 
shifting into second gear.  At around 
4300 miles, the same EXACT problem 
with tranmission happened again.  The 
second time my car was worked on, the 
problem was actually worse.  The 
problem only occurs when the engine is 
cold.

In addition, ""engine malfunction"" 
light has come on twice.  Power seats 
didn't work properly.  The radio has 
messed up.  A headlight has gone out.  
All this with less than 5000 miles."
saab,9-3,2003,Sheena, 07/27/2003,The Best Car,5,"My Silver Vector has 3800 miles on it 
and I love driving it.  I get a lot of 
complaints from many of my friends.  
Everyone seems to love the body kit on 
the car.  There is not much turbo lag 
but the car does take a second to get 
going after you hit the gas pedal.  
The sport seats are perfect for sharp 
turns."
saab,9-3,2003,Vectra, 07/28/2003,Love / Hate Relationship,3,"This is such a great car, it is a shame 
that I have a Lemon.  I was not worried 
about buying the Vector as soon as it 
was made available b/c of SAAB's 
committment to quality, however have 
ended up driving the loaner car more 
than my fun Vector.  There is something 
draining the battery when the car is 
off and they have replaced everything: 
CD Changer, 300W Amp, Window Controls, 
Battery, you name it.  Unfortunetely 
due to the fine print on the contract 
since I used GMS discount I have no 
protection under the Lemon Law.  I hope 
they get it fixed b/c it is a great car."
saab,9-3,2003,fych3173, 08/01/2003,Great car at a great price!,5,"Saab has really put together a 
wonderful car!  All the gadgets in the 
car are so cool.  Its very functional, 
fun to drive, beauty to look at, 
excellent cornering, quick 
acceleration, comfortable even for a 
6'4"" person."
saab,9-3,2003,Peteran, 07/31/2003,FUN CAR,5,"I have been driving it for a week now 
and let me tell you, that the SAAB 
commercial about a ""direct link 
between the right 
foot and a smile"" IS TRUE. my wife 
keeps telling me that every time I 
accelerate "" I never saw you smile so 
much"" followed by ""agony and 
screaming"".
options: Moonroof and Heated seats, I 
also had the dealer install a rear 
spoiler and the sport muffler. It 
really brought the car out even more, 
too bad I can't post a picture."
saab,9-3,2003,Saabhappy, 08/01/2003,I wrote off Saab until this I drove this,4,"I went to the dealer to turn in my '99 
on lease and saw the new style.  I 
thought I would just drive it for the 
heck of it and go off to the BMW and 
Mercedes dealer to pick up either a 3 
series or C-class.  I was impressed 
with the new 93 so much, that after 
driving the 3 series BMW and C-class 
Mercedes, I couldn't pass up the Saab.  
A heck of a lot of value for the money, 
the handling felt better, the ride more 
supple and the handling was on par with 
the others.  I have been nothing but 
pleased with the dealer follow through 
and it seems as if Saab is finally 
ready to be a true contender/leader in 
the entry lux market.  "
saab,9-3,2003,nbcmarine, 08/02/2003,Great Car for the Money,5,"I started out looking for a brand new 
BMW. Someone suggested I check out the 
new 9-3, I'm glad I did. Price wise its 
a great value compared to the Bimmer. 
Handsome all around, I was impressed by 
its Scandanavian attributes and 
performance. Do yourself a favor before 
you buy any car in that price range and 
check this one out. The car really is a 
great value when you consider that a 
Nissan Maxima or Honda Accord with 
similar option about the same as the 
Saab. "
saab,9-3,2003,gthehun, 08/01/2003,NO REGRET,5,"I can go on an' on what made me buy a 
Saab, but I don't want to take all 
day...Bottom line: I LOVE THIS CAR !!!
My previous cars were Acuras and 
Bimmers and I used to have a 900 turbo 
hatchback in my teenage years and that 
car was a blast so when I first saw the 
pictures and specs. of the new Saab 9-3 
last summer in Europe I thought:""give 
it a chance""...and BINGO."
saab,9-3,2003,newsaabdriver, 08/04/2003,Lots for the Money,4,"Leased the ARC model after looking at 
the Acura TSX and others.  Saab is a 
ton of car for the money.  Acura was 
too bland.  The Saab blows the Acura 
and BMW away in driver information and 
features.  Saab's 210 hp and 221 lb/ft 
torque make the car feel more like 
250hp b/c turbo acceleration.  Lag is 
noticable but present only under 
2000rpm, above 2K rpm it is strong.  
Our's is a week old and Onstar 
registration of the car is the only 
issue. Buy an Arc rather than a loaded 
Linear (cheaper that way).  Dealer 
experience was good and I expect more 
of the same in the future - all service 
covered is a plus (not so with 
Acura).   "
saab,9-3,2003,ATX Teacher, 08/15/2003,Don't buy one Because....,3,"There are many problems with the 9-3 
that are unfixable, especially if you 
live in a hot climate like Texas. The 
Fuel injextions system has many 
problems that the manufacturer is 
choosing to ignore, causing many of 
these cars to be irrepairable, but 
these problems are not showing up in 
statistics b/c the manufacturer is 
repurchasing the cars from the owners 
without having ""Lemon Law"" suits filed. 

The car looks great and is fun to 
drive, but don't be fooled. Many 
problems need to be fixed with this 
car. "
saab,9-3,2003,Builder, 08/16/2003,Excellent Choice,4,"After looking at all the competition, 
the Vector is by far the best value 
and the most fun to drive.  It looks 
great and performs well ahead of more 
expensive competition.  "
saab,9-3,2003,Fritz 2, 08/17/2003,Swedish surprise,5,"Everything from purchasing to driving 
has been a unexpected surprise! The 
dealer, Just Saab, would be rated a 12 
on a 10 scale, pleasant, knowlegeable, 
and the building is squeeky clean! And 
the car, what a thrill to own! Fit and 
finish is execellent, creature comforts 
are many, performance is great.  The 
Saab 9-3 SE gives a lot of bang for the 
bucks! I would definately suggest this 
execellent auto to any one looking for 
a fun and beautifully built vehicle. 
Keep up the good work! "
saab,9-3,2003,matt mitchell, 08/17/2003,Saab the convertable,4,"THIS CAR HAS ANYTHING THAT ONE WOULD 
EXPECT IN A FUN TO DRIVE CONVERTIBLE. 
THE SPORT FEATURE IS USED MOST OF THE

THE CAR IS WORTHY OF. THE HORSE POWER 
COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER BUT ALL IN ALL 
WE WOULD BUY AGAIN."
saab,9-3,2003,educated consumer, 08/17/2003,The Real Deal,4,"After thorough research, I have concluded this 
car to be best in class based on price, safety, 
driveability and engineering.  Compaired to Audi, 
Volvo, BMW, Infinity and Lexus, the 9-3 from the 
ground up is engineered as a serious driver's car.  
When you are able to walk out of the dealership 
paying only $30,000 for a loaded linear there is 
no comparison.  Show me another car with 10 air 
bags, and this level of safety features on this 
price point.  If you thrive on overpaying for a 
statis mobile, be my guest.  If you are an 
educated consumer, go for the Saab."
saab,9-3,2003,fyc, 08/17/2003,9-3 Arc,5,"This car is so much fun to drive.  I 
look forward to merging on to highways 
because the power band is exactly where 
it should be.  That range between 20-80 
is exhilirating.

The steering on the car is impeccable.  
It cuts through turns at high speeds 
with ease.

The interior appointments are rich and 
comfortable.  The gadgets are cool.  
Bottom line is that you'll have your 
friends drooling and asking you where 
you got it and how much you got it 
for.  Its a really unique car in its 
class.  Why be like everyone else?"
saab,9-3,2003,chuckgolf, 08/17/2003,swedish built??,2,"did not meet my expectations...  turbo 
has a lag, not as much power as i

sporty performance...

in this class of distinctiveness, 
luxury, performance, styling and 
overall comfort.  It presents the best 
handling chassis used by Saab and thus 
improvement in overall driving is 
tremendous.  The amount of standard 
features in this prices range are 
enormous and I would have this car in 
my garage any day over a 3-Series, 
Audi, or C-Class.  Understated, subtle 
elegance with enough uumph under the 
hood to make you smile!!"
saab,9-3,2003,César Mauras, 08/19/2003,DO NOT BUY THIS CAR!!!!!!,2,"It squeaks and rattles. Very unpleasant 
to drive. The quality of the interior 
material is very poor. It does feel 
like driving a Cavalier or a Saturn. I 
agree with the other reviewer who said 
that they should change the name to 
SAAturn. OnStar is nice if you like to 
be put on hold."

is a vast improvement over the older

my driving is highway). Have 15,700 
miles after 7 months of ownership.  The 
SID tripped once giving me a faulty 
gear box reading which I need to have

drive this car for fun. It has enough 
room for me and four of my friends to 
go golfing anytime and gas mileage that 
will blow your mind with all the power 
that the car has. Also I like the fact 
that I didn't pay ten thousand dollars

As I get the GM discount the options 
were the 93 and the Caddy CTS. The 93 
is clearly the better choice. The drive 
from Columbus OH to northern Michigan 
was the most fun I've ever had on a 6 
hour drive. The 2 lane blacktops in MI 
are a blast with this car. I don't see 
any turbo lag and the 6 speed is the 
way to go. There is enough acceleration 
to push you back into your seat. The 
fit and finish are exceptional. I'm 
hooked!"
saab,9-3,2003,Saab-ing in NJ, 09/09/2003,A lemon?,4,"Are computer glitches common with this 
car?  I loved my new Arc -- until day 2 
of owning it, when I had to have it 
towed in because of a computer glitch 
that made the car barely move when 
accelerating from a stop. I'll never 
feel safe again, because I'm afraid of 
the next computer failure.  And safety 
was a big part of why I chose this car!"
saab,9-3,2003,Marc F, 09/09/2003,WHAT a car!!!,4,"One of the most fun to drive cars I've 
ever owned.  Saab got it right this

into this sedan thinking it might be a 
downgrade, was I wrong!!  This car is 
tighter, has less torquey steering, 
better appointments, better sound

drove the Arc with a sport 
suspension as well but teh car did 
not seem as integrated as the 
Linear. Got the touring and driver's 
packages for a great price when GM 
was doing cash rebates in August. I 
really wanted a European car so the 
TSX was out and the rest just cost 
too much equipped as well as the 
Saab.

Car drives great. Plenty of power for 
the freeway merges and gets great 
gas mileage. "
saab,9-3,2003,FitnessCC, 07/17/2003,So far so good,4,"Six weeks into owning the Arc, and I
enjoy driving it more and more....The
ride and handling are exceptional. 
Performance is very good, but definite
turbo lag takes some getting used to. 
Had early problem with a couple of
stalls in stop and go situations, but
either break-in or dealer
""reprogramming"" seems to have corrected
the problem.  I think the car looks (and
works) as good as the BMW 3-series, for
thousands less.  Interior is very
comfortable for a car this size."

am ,so far, very satisfied with my

cheap as some may think or say.  This 
is no Grand Am.  The leather seats are 
comfortable. The dials are easy to read 
and the cabin overall has a nice  
layout.  The shifting is smooth and 
positive.  The exterior styling matches 
that of any European model in my 
opinion.  Some may complain about turbo 
lag but I have not noticed a 
significant problem with this.  
Unrealistic expectations may be to 
blame.  The infotainment system can be 
a bit distracting."

all available options  and received a 
vehicle which is gorgeous to look at, 
extremely practical (I have taken it 
camping twice and easily fit all 
required items), and thrilling to drive. 
Add to this a reasonable price tag 
and flexible purchase options, and 
the decision was fairly straight -
forward. Truly, I am pleased with this 
vehicle after 4 mos. of ownership 
and 8000 miles.  This is one car I 
can live with for many years (or at

New England, we need a car that can 
handle the in-climate weather, narrow 
roads and steep hills.  FWD or AWD 
vehicles are a necessity.  So, buying 
a ""sport"" vehicle is a really tough 
choice.  RWD is what ""sport"" is all 
about, right?  No longer.  Curves, 
hills, rain - forget it.  The 6M tranny 
is smooth and accurate.  FAST. Do the 
research and drive the cars - BMW 3, 
AUDI A4, INFINITY G35 - the Saab Arc

roomy, I love the dashboard and the 
night time feature. Most notably this 
car is sexy - oh yes it is. It is 
slick, classy, and sporty. I highly 
recommend it to anyone seeking

tough to pass on. Already put 800 miles 
on the Saab. Replaced a 1995 Volvo 850 
turbo. No comparison, the Volvo was 
quick, but did not handle the turns, 
the Saab takes the turns like it is on 
rails,a lot of fun.   
I would recommend this car to anyone 
that is considering a euro sport 
sedan. I also drove the Infinity G35 
sedan, which was quicker, but felt like 
a very heavy car, not as nimble. So far 
I love the car, and I'll keep you

(I have owned Infiniti, Nissan, 
Chrysler, pre-GM SAAB, and others).  
The base stereo system sounds 
terrible.  I added an aftermarket amp

saab,9-3,2003,True Saab Owner, 03/01/2003,The Truth,5,"I must rebut the misinformation in some 
these 9-3 reviews.  The 9-3 is built on 
a new platform only used by Saab and 
Opel as of yet.  The only truth about 
GrandAm connection is that GM plans to 
build it next-gen GrandAm on the 
platform to cut costs.  Volkswagon and 
Audi do the same.  Anyhow, I like the 
way the the 9-3 drives - nice handling 
and comfortable seats.  I think the 
Linear has plenty of power for everyday 
driving and compares favorably to the 
A4 and 3 Series base models.  The real 
story is that the Saab has leather 
interior standard.  If you make a true 
comparison (option for option) the 9-3 
will save you at least 5K over a A4 or 
3 Series."

Now you can get a $40000 vehicle for under $10000. All I hear is people complaining about little things on this car. Performance, ride, and looks, three great reasons to buy it.

saab,9-3,2004,mplieber, 01/21/2011,Great car,4,"My 2004 Saab 9-3 convertible has been wonderful. Fun to drive, with an amazing acceleration on a 4-cylinder turbo engine. When going out with the family, we use the back seats which seat adults comfortably, although a bit cramped, but this beats a 2-seater any day. Reliability has been good, and the car has been well maintained. Only complaint is occasional problems with the electrical system: windows, convertible top, radio, ignition. None has been fatal but I have experienced 2 incidents where car would not start.

saab,9-3,2004,blacksaabeth2, 04/27/2013,2004 SAAB 9-3 ARC Convertible for the Masses,4,"I truly believe that GM got it right when they retooled the 9-3 convertible for 2004.
The older 9-3 convertibles had way too much flex in the chassis.
Going over bumps made it feel like it was playing a game of Twister.
2004 convertible utilized GM's epsilon platform from Europe which firmed up the chassis 300%.
Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration but it really is firm.


Acceleration is more than adequate considering that the engine is a GM inspired 2-liter Ecotec engine with a turbo charger.
Same basic engine as found in the old Chevy Cobalt"

Handles extremely well and to date (almost 12 months later) I've had no problems.  There were some minor issues and with routine maintenance the total cost for the year is under $250!!!  I've had no electrical, mechanical or other issues at all.  This is one fun car to drive and has held up well.  I've got over 125,000 miles on the car now."
saab,9-3,2004,sdettmann, 03/25/2011,Happy camper in Wisconsin,4,"Purchased used (off lease) late in 2008 when Saab looked like it might not survive. Great buy. Car had been very well cared for, and dealer was able to provide a complete service record.
Car is solidly built and remarkably quiet with the top
up. While no sports car, it is quite peppy and fun to drive. Some turbo lag, so it is important to keep the RPM's up around 3000 if you want to go fast.
Comfortable interior in the front. I am 6'2"" and have plenty of room above my head, even with the seat elevated to its highest position.
You can put adults in the back seat, if they have no feet or legs (good for children in car seats though.)
Have driven the car 30,000 in two years, with no problem"
saab,9-3,2004,Eddy M, 03/24/2016,"Fun car, not so reliable",4,"96,000 miles and it has needed a lot of repairs. Expensive repairs, too. 

That being said, I love the way this car drives and looks. Picks up speed quick, super comfy seats, GREAT interior and exterior design. Overall a lot of fun to drive and is very safe (Swedish). It's unfortunate that they don't make these anymore.

saab,9-3,2004,kukusa, 11/05/2014,A happy Saab owner,4,"I feel very sad to see Saab went under. Its probably not surprising because today every car maker is going mainstream and the only way to survive is to get bigger, which Saab failed to achieve.  But Saab definitely didn't fail to make a solid and sporty 9-3 convertible. They don't drive as well as a 3-series, but not off by much and the car itself is much, much more special. Not the mention the excellent value.  Buy yourself a gently used 9-3 rag top today and find a trusted Saab shop, it will bring you years of happy top down motoring and attract lots of envy eyes.  "
saab,9-3,2004,anthony, 10/03/2009,An underated fun car to drive,5,"Unfortunately Saab gets bad press here in the States. This is a fun car to drive, handles well and the one fact overlooked is it's a safe car with many safety features for a convertible. I've owned many cars over the years and drove as much. The seats (where you spend most of your time) are extremely comfortable unlike the BMW convertible. A virtual maintenance free car that's a pleasure to own and drive. "

20 years.  Never owned a car that made 
people break into big smiles before, 
though I suspect the electric 
lime/yellow has a wee bit to do with 
it.  (What's the point in owning a 
conservative convertible, anyway?)

Reluctantly traded in my 98 Jaguar 
XJR.  Except for sheer power -- the 
Jag would get to 60 in 5.2 seconds -- 
the Aero appears far the better car.  
Tighter build, slick 6-speed, handles 
fabulously and the power curve suits 
the car well.

Audis and BMWs are boring and dime-a-

mean that in a positive way)."

Bought used one with 60k and now at 120k cost of my repairs are $0. When driving cars  like accords or Camry from auctions I just cannot understand way people like them so much. Will never own any other brand for sure. I am sorry to hear that other people have some problems. Just change oil every 8k and transmission oil at 90k with coils and be happy that own one of best cars around. There is no timing belt to worry about either (timing chain) good for life time of vehicle. Still original battery after 7 years and 120k. Last year one Saab was retired because of over 1,000,000 miles. I hope this will be helpful. "

All my Saabs have been good to me as far as reliability goes.  I've never had any problems and have only had to replace tires in addition to routine maintenance.  My only complaints about my 9-3 is that for the price, it should have more performance/HP and the interior material quality is noticeably inferior to my older 2000 9-5 wagon.  Braking and cornering on this car are excellent.  Acceleration is not, but it handles well at higher speeds and on the highway.  You can probably get more out of a car for the same price, but it won;t look as good.  As for the reliability of my saab 9-3, I have no complaints."

In one year and three months we have spent over $3000.00 in repairs. First thing that went was an input sensor on the auto tranny with 49,000 (covered under warranty). Next time the output sensor went out at 54,000 miles not covered. I went ahead and had the tranny flushed at the dealership at this time also. At 64,000 miles, total transmission failure to the tune of $2540.00. I talked to Saab myself took it as high as I could and they wouldn't help me at all. Saab file# 71- 649725108  "

I drive this car for business--bringing clients along, making long trips, etc.  and it's a comfortable and faithful performer.  Given the choice between a 1 hour flight and a four hour drive, I drive.  Great on the highway, quiet, powerful and safe.  Oddly, I also use it to haul things.  The roof rack goes on and off in minutes and can hold 220 pounds: that's a few sheets of plywood, or enough 2x4s to stud a new playroom for my kids.   I also installed the towing hitch (myself) and occasionally hook up a trailer to gather/move antiques and such.  And there's room for actual adults in the back seat for trips up to an hour.

Mileage is great on the highway (about 30 mpg) but on city streets it drops to the teens. A bit of trouble with the locks, and speakers not great in the 2004. Huge trunk but still prefer the old Saab hatchback (had my 1985 900 for 20 years). Safety features ahead of its time."
saab,9-3,2004,Kim, 03/04/2010,Love it when it's working,3,It is a beautiful car that is fun to drive...when everything is working which is seldom. The sunroof works when it feels like it as does the radio and CD player. Have replaced the master cylinder twice in a year and a half. The stability control went out to the tune of $700. The locks constantly malfunction. The brakes are always spongy. Have replaced a wheel bearing also. This is all in less than two years of owning it. I am considering trading it even though I owe money on it. I would never buy another Saab. I walk up to it and love it then get in and something isn't working again and I get angry.

saab,9-3,2004,Marshall H, 05/21/2010,"80% Fun, 20% Headache",3,"Excellence:  Good looks without being flashy.  Superb power delivery, very smooth for a small displacement turbo.  So quiet inside you forget its a convertible, comfy seats.  Acceptable: ""premium"" sound system is mediocre at best.  Tires break free pretty easily when accelerating from a stop into a turn, but with FWD kind of expected.  Unacceptable: Spotty build quality results in buttons and interior surface's paint rubbing off.  Electrical gremlins are a constant threat.  Complexity of common tasks like resetting oil life monitor is way more difficult than it has to be.  Saab-ness: Saab is often different just for difference sake.  Like the ""night panel"" function."

with this brand new saab (and my first brand new

gauge broke 2 days after i had it, anthor month 
after that it broke again, then the locks broke and i 
couldn't shut my driver's side door, then the remote 
control stopped working, then the black plastic 
started pealing off the inside console, the gas 
gauge broke again... then to top it all off as i was 
going down the highway at 65mph the entire car 
just shut off - NO WARNING - it just stopped 
working. the car hass been in the shop 6 times in

Have driven this car for 2 and a half years w/o any major problems.  Battery did die at 2 years; replaced under warranty.  It was a stock battery, knew it would happen sooner or later. Also had a problem with tire wear; replaced at 50%.  Otherwise, car has been very good.  Gas mileage is great, seats are comfortable, trunk is huge. "

Needed to add oil in between oil change 6. loud clicking sound when making sharp turns.
saab,9-3,2004,Bristol, 11/29/2007,Wonderful touring convertible,5,"Very good mileage, extremely high fun-to-drive quotient, intuitive controls, plethora of options at a very reasonable lease or used-car purchase price.  Many cold-weather features make it a true 4-season vehicle.  Good trunk space for a convertible.  Opening/closing top is a spectator event.  Auto with manual shifting helps the acceleration and overcomes the lack of low-end torque.  When turbo kicks in, the high-pitched whine and burst of speed is exhilarating.  Comfortable seating, much-improved visibility.  Safety features are industry-leading (popup rollbars, best crash test scores).  Rear-seat access is improved, although seating is tight."
saab,9-3,2004,Taylor Gray, 12/13/2009,Do research before you buy one!,3,"Loved the car. Had every option that cars do now except nav system. Even had 6-speed manual! Had MANY problems. It was always driven on the highway and taken care of so it was about the quality of the materials. I had to replace lower left ball joint, both struts (and mounts), springs, the entire car computer, rain sensor, radio, seatbelt, & ignition. Don't get me wrong the car was a great car but I am a college student and it was difficult to pay for repairs. I suggest not buying one unless you plan to have repair bills & you KNOW you CAN pay them. Saab's going out of business & the company is only required to make parts 10 years after the car was made. Plan on not finding any parts by '13."

I purchased my 3rd Saab, a 2004 9-3 Linear and what a disappointment.  I knew GM had more input in this 9-3 than the previous models, but I still bought one.  That's how loyal I was to Saab.  Boy, was that a mistake.  I've lost count of the number of times she's been in the shop; brakes, radio, transmission, rattles, doors unlocking by themselves, SID going blank, key replaced, etc., etc... I wish I could tell everyone who is considering a GM...er, Saab to NOT DO IT!  Stay away.  Don't let the image of the old Saab cloud your decision. PS: Saab no longer makes fighter planes - haven't for some time now."
saab,9-3,2004,OliverR, 10/16/2006,A huge disappointment,2,"Just a terrible experience. The car has been into the shop more times than I can remember. A cylinder failed within 6 months, and it was in the shop for 3 days. Then months later it went in for an electrical problem that was burning the headlights out. The cup holder broke, the seat height adjuster broke, the center armrest broke, and it goes on. Just mediocre build quality. We can't wait to get rid of it, which is a great shame. It also doesn't drive very well with excessive body roll, and screechy tires. It's not a driver's car."

Let's see... transmission, engine, and computer problems to name a few.  Then there's the water leakage, cheap interior materials that break,defiant trunk lid, volume controls that don't work, and seat upholstry that comes off.  What about the door locks that open on their own and the incompetent/hostile/indifferent dealer/corporate network?  I am so regretful that I purchased this car.  I can't believe that it is considered a luxury car.  It clearly not in the same quality realm as its European neighbors."
saab,9-3,2004,Mark N, 04/14/2017,Fun to drive and inexpensive tag with some issues,3,"I bought a gray 2004 Saab 9 3 that had 63K miles. I never had an European car but when I test drove it is immediately bought. For a little turbo engine, it had lots of power and great acceleration.  Drove it for a year without problems.   At 84k it started to rattle near the undercarriage on uneven roads.  I replaced the lower control arms and bushings but to no avail it still made noise. Fixed the noise temporarily with wd40 and spraying the bushings. The next issue I ran into was the keyless entry would work 1 out 30 times. The worst part of this was the reconnection I had to do everytime I got into the car. And the loud alarm noise when opening it with the cut key. The only fix was to buy a newer serial fob. $80 plus $50 electronic installment fee. next problem was the coolant reservoir tank. It was an easy DIY. The last issue that caused me to sell the car was the small leak in the AC. It wasn't too bad but every spring I had to refill the AC. A bit annoying but it's cheaper than replacing the whole unit. Also there was a clicking noise when I turn on the coldest setting.  Overall, fun car to drive with multiple small problems. P.S. Cup holders are neat but terrible. And MPG is terrible unless you're on the highway always.

Maintenance is very important with these cars to keep them from giving you problems.  I religiously change my oil every 7500 miles with ONLY mobile 1 full synthetic.  Also keeping up with the other maintenance has proved worth while.  The dealers charge a lot but it's better than having a broken down car.  I average 33mpg between all driving.  It has the original clutch at 80k, still shifts and drives like new.  Brake dust is out of control but brakes have lasted about 45k miles and still over half left.  I had one major issue with engine block at 45k.  It was under warranty and I got a free loaner."

There have been no major problems with this car and I have only had to do routine maintenance. The only gripe I have is that the silver plastic piece on top of the shifter came off (super glue fixed that!) and there was a rattle in the door which the dealer took care of promptly. The car handles like a dream and is very sporty. The gas mileage is also fantastic! I average 23 in the city (stepping on the gas pedal pretty hard) and 34 on the highway doing 75 to 80 miles an hour. I would not hesitate to recommend this car to anyone!

I didn't have to pay for anything to get fixed!

I have had absolutely no problems with the car other than normal wear and tear issues (new front brakes/pads, new tires) and it has totally exceeded my expectations. It handles great in all types of weather and has only gotten stuck in the snow once. I have never felt safer in a car, and even though it's kind of a little guy, I feel like I have a substantial car around me when I drive.

The Saab 9-3 is truly a symbol of status with its elegant curves and pampering aesthetics.  Drivers finding themselves in situations requiring speed and response will have no regrets that they have purchased the car of their dreams.  General Motors has built a car that allows drivers to feel as though they were flying without ever leaving the ground.
saab,9-3,2004,Haywire, 01/03/2004,I smile each time I drive this car!,5,"I couldn't be more happy with this 9-3 
convertible!  Got an excellent price 
and love the way it drives and looks.
I do feel like an individual on the 
road...you really don't see too many of 
them!  The safety features are 
empressive. A lot of attention to 
detail...smart designing."
saab,9-3,2004,bblngtme, 01/31/2004,SAAB Story,3,"Sorry, I can't give my SAAB 9-3 a good 
review.  My car was lemon and was 
returned to the manufacturer.  Even 
though the engine and transmission 
worked well, the electronics had 
problems as well as the parking brake.  
I had to have the car towed into the 
dealership 6 times, 3 for the engine 
immobilizer shutting down the car, and 
3 times because the parking brake would 
not release.  Oh well, the car in no 
longer an issue for me"
saab,9-3,2004,Demetri, 03/29/2006,Great Car at Any Price,4,"I feel sorry for those Saab owners who've had a bad experience with their 9-3.  I've owned the car almost two years and have been completely happy with it.  The Linear's motor puts out 175hp, but with a low curb weight (for this segment) and the great-shifting 5sp, I can get off the line quick enough for most situations.  Great gas mileage (27 mpg mixed), plenty of back seat room for our 3 kids, massive trunk, and Saab's unbeatable safety rating.  The important stuff is all standard - traction control, dynamic stability control, brake assist, 8 air bags, etc etc.  My wife likes it so much, we're getting her the 9-3 Sport- Combi and ditching our minivan."
saab,9-3,2004,Jurynotout, 04/12/2004,Brakes!!!!!!!!,3,"I definitely enjoy driving this car, 
until I have to slow down or stop it.  
The brakes have been horrible from day 
one.  They have ""roared"" 
and/or ""squeaked"" since I purchased 
the car.  It is has been in the shop 
three times already.  Also, the radio 
sometimes just goes out after starting 
my car.  Only a high pitch sound 
remains.  Overall:  If they get the 
brakes working properly then I will 
like it.  Currently, not so impressed 
with this car!  Thinking I should have 
went with the BMW or Lexus."
saab,9-3,2004,misha90, 06/26/2004,Sold on Saab,4,"This is my first Saab. With price of 
fuel rising if I keep my foot out of 
the turbo I get 30mpg. Corners better 
than my 79 Porsche(Audi)924. Turbo lag 
is almost imperceptible. Huge trunk for 
a car its size. Very quiet on the 
highway. I like the info display on 
dash more than I thought. Radio is way 
cool some stations it tells you the 
song that is playing. I am sold on 
Saabs. Bought my wife 9-5 wagon. "
saab,9-3,2004,luvmys60, 06/30/2004,Thank goodness for my S60,3,"I bought a brand-new 04 Saab 9-3 Arc in
May and I was happy with my decision. 
Sadly, too many problems arose including
a bad fuel pump - which had to be
replaced.  Because of the lemon law,
Saab bought it back and I switched to a
new S60 2.5T which feels better inside,
drives the same, and has slightly more
comfortable seats."
saab,9-3,2004,ESB, 07/16/2004,First Month,4,"Love the car.  Traded from a 2001 LS430 
to this for something smaller, 
sportier, and more fun and we love it 
so far. Dealer experience was 
incredibly good. Great deal on a great 
fun car.  My first SAAB and likely not 
my last based on my so far limited 
experience!  Classy alternative to a 
Japanese car."
saab,9-3,2004,Jwbania, 07/22/2004,9500 Exciting Miles,4,"Very nice car! Quite a looker both 
inside and out.  Turns heads and gets 
comments. Great Factory wheels on the 
Aero! Turbo is fantastic for passing 
and handling is probably as good as it 
gets for a front wheel drive factory 
car. Hand to take it in once for a 
faulty air valve, but was a minor 
problem."
saab,9-3,2004,COGuy, 08/10/2004,"Super Fun, but a little rattly.",4,"I've put about 1700 miles on my new 9-3 
in two months.  Very responsive, fast, 
corners great.  Very slight turbo lag, 
but 5-speed overcomes this.

Back seats are a little small, 
especially for a baby seat (passenger 
seat has to be fairly far forward).  
During the 30-day checkup, I had them 
check out a ""clank"" noise from the 
front axle, but they could not 
duplicate the noise.  Seems to happen 
whenever I back out of the driveway in 
the morning.  I've also recently 
discovered strange rattling/buzzing 
noises coming from inside the door 
panels when going over 20 mph.  "
saab,9-3,2004,COGuy2, 09/24/2004,Follow up from my last review...,3,"OK... about a month after my last 
review (which noted only small 
problems), it's in for service where 
they found coolant in one of the 
cylinders.  Long story short, two weeks 
later they're completely replacing the 
engine (which has 2500 miles on it).  
Brand new car, and on 3 occasions 
already I've had to drive a loaner 
(which right now is a Subaru... SaabUSA 
was giving the dealership grief about 
giving me a Saab loaner? Huh???!).  
Luckily (?) I'm approaching the 
criteria to invoke the Lemon Law in 
Colorado, which is the vehicle being 
out of service for 30 days in the first 
year... pretty sad."
saab,9-3,2004,Branden, 09/30/2004,Happy as can be,5,"This is a great car. The autostick 
works like a charm. The only concern 
which is minor is the amount of brake 
pad dust that accumulates on the 
wheels. But hopefully that will go away 
as the brakes wear in. The 9-3 cost 
thousands less than a comparable A4, 
325 or S40, and the insurance was 
cheaper too!"
saab,9-3,2004,AlamoSpear, 10/07/2004,So far so good!,4,"Purchased my 9-3 used with 4,800 miles 
on it (9,000 now).  I assume that it 
was traded in because of the rather 
harsh ride (my previous car was a MBZ 
300E), especially given the poor 
condition of the roads around here.

But it is a blast to drive - quick 
handling and acceptable acceleration 
with only 170HP.

Love the exterior design.  The 
enterior is minimalistic - very 
European.  Trunk is quite large given 
the overall size of the car."
saab,9-3,2004,SaidNoori, LA,Cant wait to get it in convertible!,5,"At first I hated it because I didnt 
know how to drive stick shift; the 
dealership didnt have it automatic in 
the color I wanted. Took me almost 3 
months to master the manual and now I 
LOVE IT! My previous car was a C class 
MBZ and had constant electronical 
problems and had to take it for service 
literally every month. My Saab is 
truely reliable, very sporty, fun to 
drive, unique looking, and I just love 
it. I cant wait till my lease is over 
in 2 years so I can get it in 
convertible. I was always intrigued by 
Saab and people who never drove a Saab 
discouraged me to get one. Im happy 
with my choice and I'll be driving Saab 
for many years to come."

saab,9-3,2004,Ali, 10/18/2005,What a Lemon,2,"I could not be more unhappy with a car. I had a 2003 which was fine. I traded it for a new 2004.  You name it, and it has gone wrong. I spend more time at the dealership than at work. The dealership has been awful, Saab corporate has been awful, and the car itself - even worse. I cannot believe companies can get away with selling such a piece of trash.  The transmission does not perform properly, parts keeping breaking inside the car, the windshield wiper motor has blown, the oil pressure sensor has been replaced (and other major mechanical issues). I will never, ever buy another Saab, and probably will never by another GM vehicle because of my experience with this car. "
saab,9-3,2004,SAAB guy, 04/13/2006,totally underrated car,5,"The Saab Aero convertible is a well designed, efficient, fun to drive machine. How many cars deliver 30 mpg at 80 mph? Great back-roads machine as well. The car exhibits minimal understeer. The Pirelli PZero Rosso's are responsive and provide a good ride despite their performance nature. This is my first Saab after owning them since 1979 with an automatic transmission. This is not just any automatic but an Aisin 5 speed unit that can be paddle shifted from the steering wheel. It is very smooth and responsive. Contrary to the drivel that is written by all the BMW lovers in the auto press the chassis has no flex, no rattles on any kind of road surface.  "
saab,9-3,2004,Bob, 08/12/2006,Fun to drive,5,"I LOVE my Saab. Perfect gas mileage, good acceleration (stick shift), great looks. It was everything I wanted in a car."
saab,9-3,2004,BoB B, 10/09/2006,2004 Saab 9-3 Linear,4,All in all not a bad car. It just started with the electrical gremlins @ 35K. Had the window regs. replaced many times. The rattles have started too. 
saab,9-3,2004,Horrified/Sadened, 04/21/2007,A truly heartbreaking expereince,3,After 8 months and only 10K miles my once passionate purchase is now a shop visiting menace. Small things I was coping with. Now the transmission. Completely unreliable even for work commutes. Rattles galore and surprisingly weak gas mileage (24.2) at high altitude. Can't wait to get rid of it.
saab,9-3,2004,Carmaster216, 10/06/2007,Great Saab 9-3!,4,The Saab 9-3 is a pretty good car. In between its great luxury and its being very sporty I would say this car a very good car to have.
saab,9-3,2004,Domer90, 07/10/2007,Another Awesome Saab! (2004 9-3 Arc),5,"This is my 3rd Saab and I love it as much as my first 1985 900S. The 9-3 is smaller than my 9-5, but has a more comfortable interior with two cup holders and a better instrument pannel. The techtronic shifter manual override is sweet for those times when the auto just doesn't cut it off the line. The Arc is quick, but opt for the Aero if you want blazing speed. Euro styling with the control of FWD in the snow and rain. Bought it off GM lease with no major repairs but that is no surprise to me having had two others both with over 130,000 K. I LOVE THIS CAR. Goes 110 MPH with ease. It is a Saab through and through and is not for those who like to be convential. Enjoy it!"
saab,9-3,2004,Kenneth James, 09/06/2007,Best car for the money,5,"The drive is the experience for the love of driving with the handling and feel of the car is unexplainable.  You just drive this car once and you will understand my delight with driving this car.  So, give it a test drive and make the decision for yourself and appreciate speed and comfort of a once in a lifetime automobile."
saab,9-3,2004,JK, 06/13/2006,"So far, so good.",4,"Picked up a 9-3 from the factory in Sweden. Highly recommended for the experience and the savings.  I compared the 9-3 to the Audi A4 and BMW 3 series.  Ultimately chose the Saab because I knew friends who loved their Saabs and my previous car was an entry level model that got me in to a nicer car, but lacked most of the features which makes driving nice cars worthwhile.   With all the options I wanted the other cars were close to 40K, e.g. real leather is an pricey extra on 3 series.  The 9-3 Arc with nearly all the options came in just above 30K.  So far I love it, the only thing that worries me is finding a good mechanic in a couple of years when things inevitably break.  "
saab,9-3,2004,chema, 04/19/2016,just one year with car ready to let it go,3,"bough the saab from a kid for $700 a year ago and with 174k miles (yeah too many miles but i needed a car asap) i test drove it and was impressed looks like last owners took good care of the car, at first i didnt research it much but went with the reviews here within the  whole year  i had to replace the headlights got them cheap at amazon...left control arm, resonator,radio with speakers,front brakes and rotors,spark plug coils,wheel balance,battery,disable the alarm as it was going off random times at night,sway bar links. from all the work it had i wanted to get rid of the vibration at speeds over 70 my local mechanic said problem is the tires ok changed the tires , but nothing did a balance, nothing, alignment! nothing and was told to just get new rims...im like naaaaah i leaving it like that for the fact that now 194k its getting ready to die the  engine vibrates most of the the time and sometimes i dont feel the engine at all sometimes it wanna go fast sometimes not. shocks and struts are stiff and a little soft sometimes but no really i hate the banging sound 

door locks dont work only with key fob
passenger door locks has to be fixed so it will open from the inside tried fixing it twice but it keeps braking
a couple a month ago got an air bag malfunction warning its a recall dealer said will replace at no cost once the part become available
well i dont wanna drive it if i get in accident and the air bag wont go off then its gonna be on saab? heck cant cause they not in market
brakes pad and rotos are not too worn but a few times i pressed the brakes hard on high speed to come into full stop and the car keeps going a few more feet
no i didnt hear the tiers sky my guess its the calipers
cruise control doesnt work
wipers dont go all the way down 
anyways for all these stuff to get fixed i quoted about $5000 i should just get another car and a brand thats still in the market

saab,9-3,2004,Ryan Garner, 03/16/2019,Cheap dealers,1,"The Auto house of Fort Wayne was not a good place to test drive from. They never had the 04 Saab convertible inspected, it needed thousands of dollars of repairs and the one p0ace that attempted to fix the flex pipe didn’t really fix the problem. Sad that this car was in such poor shape. The brakes didn’t stop while driving several times, and yet they allowed me to test drive it, Crazy! Saab convertibles are high end luxury cars, but this one was low rent, broken down Sad Saab.

saab,9-3,2004,Philadelphia girl, 08/31/2005,Disappointment,2,"I have been very disappointed with my SAAB. It has had one serious problem after another -  malfunctioning electrical systems, computerized keys wouldn't start the car and had to be replaced two separate times etc.   The CD player comes on when I enter the car, trunk pops open for no good reason, and the brake lights stay on.  The engine light is frequently illuminated on the dash - apparently for no good reason. The electric seat lever allowing access to the backseat broke off and had to be replaced.  The car handles well (except in snow), accelerates quickly it is great fun to have a convertible.  However,  for the price of this car I would have expected greater reliability after one year"

straightforward and polite. The car is 
a different story. Within the first 30k 
miles, the car completely ran out of 
oil TWICE. I drove this heap for up to 
20k miles with NO OIL before the 
indicator came on. The most

It is a blast to drive and has every luxury aspect that a BMW or Jaguar would without the ridiculous price tag. Sometimes! The turbo blows you away when you take off. I used to drive a Toyota Solara and it doesn't even compare at all to this Swedish luxury car! It has every bell and whistle a person needs in a car. Gas mileage is awesome but could sometimes need a little more leg room for the back seaters and would like a bigger trunk. It is hard to fit my golf clubs in the trunk and when you drive a luxury car you expect it to fit golf clubs with ease

The standard tires are inadequate for 
the winter climate....so I've already

there is no torque steer, yet the 
steering is responsive and sharp.  The 
ride is a little knobbly on harsh 
surfaces, but never uncomfortable.  The 
car is poised and secure even in 
extreme turns with bumps.  It holds a

fantastic; torque peaks at 2500 rpm and you feel 
it. Awesome brakes like BMW, but better and 
vented all around. Ride and handling with the 16"" 
wheels is just right, not too soft (15"") or hard 
(17"" on highway). Interior is like Swedish 
furniture; Arc is much nicer than the Linear. 
The Arc is a bargain compared to competitors; 
looks great in black/parchment. It has more 
equipment and space than others, and costs 
much less given the equipment we got. Dealer 
gave us a great price, treated us very well. 
Economy is better than the others at 20/30."
saab,9-3,2004,Michael Leyden, 12/10/2003,Blown away,5,"This car is just like they say in the 
commercial. If you drive it, you'll 
want to buy it. I wasn't even looking 
at cars, let alone Saabs! I wanted to 
get another truck. But I saw the price 
that they start at and their look is 
impeccable and nobody has them. So I 
test drove it, and I was sold. It 
drives like a dream, handling every 
nook of the road with ease. The turbo 
gives it the performance anyone needs. 
And since not that many people have 
them, I'm looked at like I'm driving a 
ferrari."

quieter and more solid than my 2001. 
The seats are more substantial and the

larger.  I do miss the hatchback that 
I had on my 2001 though. I also think 
the sound system or speakers in the 
2001 sounded better. I miss the 
weather radio feature that I had in my 
2001. Perhaps it's the increased sound

I brought the car in the dealer. The 
engine is the strongest part of the 
9³. SAAB has hit a homerun with the 
2.0T. The engine has a large 
powerband. If you are driving in the 
city or on the freeway. The power is 
always there. My last five cars were 
VW/Audi's. I traded in my 2003 A4 for 
the 9³. I had to get use to the 
Swedish layout of the car. I think 
every button and knob is in the right 
place. I get way more compliments with 
the 9³, then I ever got with the A4. I

more look at the Saab, and found the 
totally redesigned 2004 was there and 
blew me away. But it and expensive- no 
deals.  SO, back to the Audi, which is 
slow and poorly equiped(1.8T) or very 
expensive (3.0).  So, knowing how 
cheap they were selling the Saab 2003 
at the end of the year, I held out and 
as expected in two months the price 
dropped about $150 per month on the 
new program.  Since, it has gone down

This is car is FAST, fun to drive, looks GREAT, and not found on every corner.  The 330i is a great car but the 9-3 won me over. The car takes off like a jet, and before you know it you're flying. It is very easy to be doing 85-100 MPH without noticing it. Once you drive this car, you will want to buy it. I can't say enough good things about this car and how much fun it is to drive!!

saab,9-3,2004,Seattle SAAB Owner, 03/06/2004,Beauty is only skin deep,4,"If you get a Linear trim line, I highly 
recommend the stick, as the automatic 
simply lags. I like the styling and 
there are a few neat features BUT, the 
build qulity is suspect at best.  Lots 
of plastic on the inside translates 
into a cheap feel and rattles 
everywhre.  Limited space around the 
pedals and the placing of the trunk 
release are serious design flaws.  
Overall, if I had the chance to buy 
this car again, I wouldn't.  It's easy 
to see why GM is discounting these cars 
so much;it is the only way they can 
unload them.  Even with the deep 
discount I got, I still don't feel that 
it was a goo deal. Dealer support has 
been poor."
saab,9-3,2004,Stack4, 03/03/2004,First Saab,5,"Well I just recently jumped out and 
bought a fully loaded 9-3 aero.  I love 
the thing it is so much fun to drive.  
It's true what people say once you test 
drive one youll usualy buy one.  I 
did.  Others are also right about the 
complements and pleasant stares you 
get.  Not many of these great cars are 
out and about.  One problem I have had 
is that my tire pressure gauge sensor 
went out.  But i assume it shouldnt be 
a problem and they will fix it once I 
can bring myself to drop it off at the 
dealer."

awesome for touring in the Smoky Mtn. 
National Park at night... Through my 
job, I drive over 50 different makes and

flawless on the first 1000 miles! Strog

saab,9-3,2004,Greg Waldron, 03/19/2004,Saab's Back!,4,"A very quick and responsive car - great 
fun to drive.  Drives more like an Audi 
or BMW than a Saab - it's completely 
lost that old ""rubbery, tippy"" 
sensation.  Feels a bit ""tinny"" 
compared to the Germans, though.  
Perhaps this is a result of being built 
on GM's new ""world car"" platform.  The 
engine is pure Saab Turbo - a great 
motor!
Saab are closing the performance sedan 
gap with the Germans - they are closing 
in on best-in-class with this model and 
with the current price differential 
against the the Audi A4 3.0 and BMW 330 
its a good value."

is great.  Stereo is fine.  Auto driver seat is very 
responsive and comfortable.  Interior is quiet.

'pickup' found as you proceed into 3d,
4th, 5th and 6th gears.  That's right,
6th gear.  The 6th gear is a very nice
addition for highway driving.
Unfortunately 80-90 mph feels like
60mph!!  Handling is outstanding and,
for my purposes (some moderate distance
highways driving, country roads in rural
NE and pleasure trips) better than G35

expectations. We were looking upscale 
and wanted some practical returns for 
an impractical investment. The vehicle 
safety rating was an attraction and the 
styling has no apologies to make 
against the more widely purchased 
European sedans. The standard-output 
turbo is plenty,delivering impressive 
power at the merest 'punch' of the 
accelerator. The car's handling systems 
are equal to the control task presented 
by the surge in power yet not so tight 
that you feel like you bought a go-kart 
with leather seats. If you want to say 
you've 'arrived' but still have a few

mixture of Swedish (scania) and 
american (GM) input refine this to be 
a joy to drive.  Being a mid-30's anti-
conformity punk, I was even 
considering the Mitsubishi Evo-8.  I 
would have bought the EVO-8 if I was 
25.  I probably would have purchased 
the Benz if I was 50.  The SAAB is the

I was concerned about the snow. It went 
right through my unplowed parking lot

amazing. The updated styling and the 
new computer display on the dash. I 
believe I am racing around with 210 hp. 
The car feels and looks high end. With 
the 4 cyl engine, I save on gas. The

surprisingly quick for a 4 cylinder, 
and the turbo lag is quite minimal.  

I particularly like the styling and I 
am glad Saab did away with the

SAAB is always offering incentives so 
it was easy for me to walk out of the

$34,000 for $28,000. These days

saab,9-3,2004,Snaaber, 08/31/2004,"Depriciation, Depreciation, Depreciation",3,"Its a very nice car, however, be ready 
to be hit with a ton of depreciation 
once you try and get out of it. I've 
had a number of Saabs over the years. 
Your new car will be worth about 33% of 
MSRP for trade-in value after four 
years. Even if you get a significant 
discount of $5,000 or so, the car will 
still depreciate by $17,000 in four 
years!

When you think about Saab, just say 
depreciation...plus you can think of 
Saab as GM's replacement for 
Oldsmobile. I'm sure that will help too."
saab,9-3,2005,John, 03/31/2016,Still The Best Saab I've Owned!!,5,"Let me start by saying that a Saab is not a car for everyone. If you don't know anything about them you shouldn't buy one.! I'll give you an example.  When I first bought this car I went to do an oil change and realized for the first time in my life that I owned a car that was too low profile to put up on ramps. I called every auto parts store in the area and no one had any kind of ideas so I went to YouTube and found a solution by using two long boards.  When I bought the car the entire audio system was not functioning. The dealership told me that the amp underneath the driver seat was damaged due to corrosion a common problem. Replacing was $1400 or rebuild $600. Again I went to YouTube and found that I could remove the entire amp and fuse the fiber optics together and solve the problem no cost just an hour's worth of work. Now I have a permanently fixed working radio and audio system. But those are not things that most people would want to do or could do. If you are good at doing things yourself this is a great car for you, if you're not you're going to get taken to the cleaners by people that overcharge and take you for a ride literally. It's good to do your research first to know what you're getting into and find some mechanics you can rely on and rely on yourself for most of the repairs that are small!

Few other things. It needs synthetic oil  every 10,000 miles. Fresh battery every few years even a little bit off will make it run funny. Needs all fluids and filters checked frequently to make sure they are all clean and in good shape. If you do this the car will last pretty much forever! My old Saab has 209000 miles and I'm still driving it everyday. I bought the 93 and it's like a new car inside and out! Some people say the interior is cheap by comparison to other Saabs but I disagree.  Although some plastic parts may appear a little bit cheaper they can be well maintained and look great.  The seats and interior are great...very comfortable.... excellent gas mileage too. Most of these cars will have to have the  suspension worked on by a hundred thousand miles. When I purchased it I put on some new sway bar links which typically wear out fast. They cost $18 apiece. I  also put on a new flex pipe on the exhaust.  Total of about $100.
Also had to clean the throttle body due to a rough idle issue because it was dirty and never before cleaned. Replaced the spark plugs and the air cleaner as well. All should be good now for the next hundred thousand miles except for oil changes. If you purchase one do yourself a favor and buy an OBD2 code reader so if a light pops on you can easily identify the problem rather than being ripped off by a dealership! 

The car is reliable and rides great. Its fast and looks great. It's 11 years old and could not have run better when new.

Update: Still feel the same a year later. Unfortunately this is now my only Saab since my older 900 was ruined by a Tuffy oil change place that overfilled it by almost 2 quarts and killed the engine. I will never trust them again.
"
saab,9-3,2005,Renee Lindsay, 09/16/2015,Best Small Car!,5,"Just bought my 2005 Linear 93 2.0t a month ago and it's the funnest car I've ever owned. The ride, the pick up on the highway is awesome. I have a automatic with the optional manual and it will definitely get you down the road in a hurry. I get 28 mpg so far. I paid 4k and it's the best money I've ever spent on a car.
"
saab,9-3,2005,Greg Maldonado, 07/17/2015,"Love it or hate it, average car at average price.",5,"This isn't your typical 1990's and older Saab. You won't get the blazing midrange speed nor the amazing cabin view of the outside world, but you will get a decent family sedan that gets decent MPG and has top-of-the-line safety features.

In base form the 2.0 Linear Sports Sedan is a slow, safe family car with a little bit of Saab watered down into the GM-inspired plastic interior and bodywork. For the Saab purist, stay away from this car; you will despise it and all the GM parts that went into making it. If you can overlook that stained heritage and settle into the comfortable leather/vinyl seats, adjust the electric mirrors for best view, and get the steering wheel tilted and positioned to your liking, you'll find this car is quite tolerable and easy to drive. You just won't drive it very quick. The small turbo has enough boost to keep up with all but the fastest traffic, but it lacks the serious boost power to be entertaining. The handling is predictable and pleasant. This is a sedan you can toss into a corner and not really worry about, thanks to the generous traction control and the FWD handling. In wild weather that same traction control system helps keep you firmly planted on the road, and with a good set of winter tires you can go places that seem impossible.

I bought mine in Beige Metallic, used  as a program car, with 120,000 miles on the odometer and have owned it almost exactly one year. In that year the most expensive repair has been replacing the pitted windshield, and the battery. I have repaired/replaced many items that were worn from age, including bumper inserts, windshield glass and rear glass surround, trim pieces, hoses, lamps, door seals, and misc fasteners. I have added a better sound system and upgraded the engine management computer as well as the turbo, but have not altered the body or interior. It now drives with a more sporty feel while still maintaining the overall factory look. I drive 98% city with very little open highway. My city MPG hovers around 21mpg while the best estimate I have for Highway is 38mpg.

That said, this car doesn't respond well to modifications. The Trionic8 computer system which controls the car prevents most quick-and-dirty bolt-on items from adding any significant improvement. The T8 system in the Linear is intended for daily-driver and economy, and does what it can to keep performance at that level. That T8 system can be upgraded (similar to ""chipping"" on other cars), and a few other items can be upgraded to help increase performance up to around the base Aero specs with minimal effort and expense, thus providing the Linear with a little bit more sportiness. Of course, as with any car, if you throw large amounts of money at it you can get it to perform to your budget, if you want.

As everything is run on a BUS computer system, and Saab having now gone out of business, locating a technician to work on the car can be a slight hassle. While the same TECHII diagnostics system for the same years of GM models can be used on these models of Saab, not many GM dealerships have the knowledge to repair Saab cars.

Oh, yes. The ignition is on the center console, there is a pop-n-swing-out cupholder on the dash, and the dashboard has a Night Mode which turns off all the interior illumination and gauges except for the most basic speedometer and management controls. This car has one of the highest safety and crash ratings for the model year.


Pros: Safe. Reliable. Great handling. Good view from the cabin with no blind spots. Good fuel economy. Inexpensive to repair (comparable to same years of GM vehicles for most repairs - lots of parts interchange to other makes and models). Good air conditioning system. Easy to maintain and repair if you are self-motivated.

Build quality is average. There is a lot of plastic and cheapness in the interior. Externally everything fits together well
 and feels solid. Sound system is good but not outstanding, lacking fidelity and power.

Cons: No performance from the economy engine and computer. Computer BUS system requires diagnostics equipment to diagnose car troubles. Lack of repair technician support. Difficult to upgrade performance using normal methods. Sound system upgrade is near impossible due to the use of fiber-optic system. Heating system could be better due to a very odd mix-control system which leaves cold spots by design. Climate control motors are prone to breaking gears.

Overall the Saab-ness of this car barely shines through the GM whitewashing, with excellent safety but sleep-inducing sportiness. It is an overall average family sedan with some interesting little twists to the common interior controls.

Addendum. 4 years on and this little rough-cut zirconia or a car is still running well. No major issues, with only standard wear parts like brakes and tires needing to be replaced.

I bought with 52k miles and have put 20k on it since. I have had a few issues with it so far
- drivers side mirror piece fell off and had to be glued back on
- back window wasn't working --> $200
-other back window stopped working
- have had to change bulbs in headlights 2x already
-error messages -> traction control/stability/immobilizer failure (after jumping battery it did not want to start and went haywire for a while before starting)
- A/C blower locked up and had to be released and oiled up
- Car wash knocked off antenna cover
However this car is pretty fun to drive and no major mechanical issues. Great MPG over 40 often. Lost 2k in value already."
saab,9-3,2005,AM, 10/27/2010,Great Car - I will buy another.,4,"We bought this car for my daughter and I now ask to borrow it.  It is great fun to drive.  We have the 5- speed manual and I was surprised by the level of performance.  The quality is evident and I especially like the fact that the 2.0 L 4 cylinder has a timing CHAIN instead of a timing belt.   We get 37 MPG on the highway at 70 MPH.  Driving 60 MPH, I can get over 40 MPG (I did this on a 300 mile trip I took recently on back roads).  About 26 MPG in the city.   Good quality leather seats.   Beware of trying to modify the radio.  The whole electronics system in the car is controlled through fiber optic lines that also run the radio.  It is expensive to repair the radio."
saab,9-3,2005,MJ, 05/01/2009,Very satisfying drive.,4,"The 9-3 convertible is a total package that comes together for a very satisfying ride. If you look at any one detail of the car it may or may not be best in class, but when combined it just makes you smile. It gives a solid, tight, controlled ride, a little busy on bad pavement. You're very connected to the road. Acceleration from a dead stop is nothing special, but when you're on the road the passing power is impressive! Very comfortable seats. The automatic top opens/closes in 20 secs, even if you're driving (slowly). The stereo isn't strong, but its notes & sounds are very precise (don't confuse bass boost with good music). There's a reason this is Saab's most popular car. "
saab,9-3,2005,MarkPopkie, 10/09/2010,A Lear Jet without the wings.,4,"Just purchased this vehicle used with 75k miles. Previous owner had been meticulous with service records so I feel confident that this baby was pampered. I have barely added 100 miles to the odometer but I am already impressed. Having driven or owned nearly every kind of car in this category, the Saab stands out as the most fun to drive. Fantastic handling, the turbo responds to my every whim, and the air handling system is straight out of a Boeing 747. I have never driven a 4 cylinder that handles A/C quite like this. Despite having a 13 speaker sound system, I was underwhelmed by the stereo - I may have already blown a driver. I do,however, love the timeless quality of the exterior design."
saab,9-3,2005,jbeloff, 08/13/2013,9.3 convertible.....I'm not getting rid of it,4,I have owned a saab for over 20 years and find them to be the highest quality car. While Saab has had it's many challenges over the years it has always produce a solid performer with above average reliability. Unfortunately the markets tends to go with the brands with the biggest budget to impress you with the image of it's brand. Saab has done a outstanding job mixing form with function. Everyone who has enjoyed the ride in my car are always impressed with the quality and find themselves asking why they never considered on. Saabs brand deserves leadership that can carry it's unique niche and continue it's quality builds to attract more owners looking for something that just works well.
saab,9-3,2005,tom, 02/21/2009,Better than expected,5,"I purchased this car used with 45,000 miles on it and 6 mos. left on the factory warranty. The car has been great, looks and runs like a brand new car with no problems. It was a one owner car that I purchased from the original selling dealer. "
saab,9-3,2005,barron von costume, 07/09/2008,More Than I Expected,4,"I purchased my 2005 9-3 Arc from Enterprise Car Sales. I had read extensive reviews online about how great the car handled, accelerated etc. I was a little shy when I was behind the wheel with the salesman riding shotgun. I could tell right away that this car had a lot more power than I was willing to let out. Once I picked the car up off the lot however, I let it fly. I had perma-smile the second my foot hit the gas - this thing can fly! Once the turbo kicks in my head snapped back a little and I was in love. The features and the customization of the driving experience are also a big reason why I love this car.  Overall a great car and a great value ($1500 under KBB value- thx Enterprise!!)"
saab,9-3,2005,Songwriter Guy, 07/12/2008,Nicest Car I've Ever Had Thus Far!,5,"Ergonomically, I feel like somehow Saab snuck into my room at night and took a mold of my body and built the new 9.3 to fit me. It's just amazing. It's solid, comfortable and a blast to drive.  The overall quality is evidenced in just about every way. I've had 9000's in the past and wasn't sure I'd like this. Well... I don't like it; I love it!  "
saab,9-3,2005,EGP, 08/25/2008,"Saab's Quirks are irksome, repairs=$$",3,"The employee discount for all promotion in 2005 made our 2005 Arc w/driver's package affordable. However, we should have stayed away. Within the warranty period, the car was into the dealer 3 or 4 times, one all of the radio and interior electronics freaked out and they had to replace the radio and command module. Luckily this was under warranty. However, 3 years, 55,000 miles, and just out of warranty, the car quits on the highway during rush hour forcing my wife to make some risky emergency moves. Car Would not start again! Turns out tat the the engine computer failed, and it cost us $900. Now 5k miles later, the stability system is giving critical errors.. could be $1000 to fix this time."
saab,9-3,2005,Michigan, 06/12/2009,Very Enjoyable,4,"Bought it used for the purpose of a new salesman's car. I easily put 50,000 miles on in one year and never had anything major go wrong. Tires, synthetic oil, blah blah blah. The point? No problems. I had been warned by many about a Saab's reliability. This obviously proved untrue. The zero to whatever as many reviews have testified to is nothing to write home about. It's better than most I would say, but passing power with the auto-stick transmission is a blast. The trunk is huge, backseats are small and the overall comfort for the driver is sufficient. Good tires go a long way and I tinted all of the side and rear windows which dramatically improves overall car appearance (I think)."
saab,9-3,2005,soll, 06/12/2005,a huge step forward,4,"I had a 2001 9-3 SE. everything wrong with that car (and there was a lot) has been fixed. Night and day. A rare example of Detroit actually improving on a European car. As a devoted Audi fan, I selected the 9-3 over the A4 Cabriolet and haven't regretted it for a minute. Kudos to GM."
saab,9-3,2005,Thom, 05/09/2005,"Great, fun car",4,"Great car, from the service at the dealership to its scheduled maintenance.  I've only had one problem and it was with the emergency brake.  The dealership towed it for free and fixed it over night.  They even provided me with a Saab loaner car.  The car is quite quick for its price range and is always fun to drive, especially on open, twisty roads (saab fixed torque steer!).  The cars interior seems complex at first, but becomes easy to use after 10 minutes.  Next to BMW's iDrive, this is like coloring in the lines.  The tall stack design of the cockpit makes you think you're in an airplane, which sometimes brings you to the speed of one...minus 1 mach level of course.  Outstanding car."
saab,9-3,2005,kidlatAzul, 09/02/2008,"Safe, reliable, comfortable SAAB",5,"I purchased a 2005 SAAB 9-3 because I wanted the safest vehicle I could afford. In 2005, the 9-3 was one of only a few vehicles on the IIHS top safety pick list. Fortunately, to date I have not had to test the 9-3's many safety features, but feel reassured driving this car. But in addition to being safe, the 9-3 has anchor-like brakes, handles great, is comfortable for all-day cruising, has ample acceleration, and gets up to 37 mpg on highway. Even around town, I've never gotten less than 26 mpg (manual tranny helps). Only problems after 3 years & 56,000 miles have been headlight bulbs burning out twice, each time covered by warranty. The nicest car I've ever owned."
saab,9-3,2005,MJ, 09/24/2008,Very satisfying car,4,"This is a really nice car to drive. It's responsive, controlled and quick. From a dead stop the acceleration is normal but it has great passing power -  which is really what you need. It accelerates from 40 to 65 (or more, if you dare) in a heartbeat! The ride is stiff (Aero) but very tight. It's very comfortable (Aero seats) and the power convertible top works great. No noticeable decrease in headroom. Still has trunk room with the top down. Stereo is good - sound is very true to actual. "
saab,9-3,2005,icecold328, 09/28/2009,So fun. Exclusive.,5,"I went through MANY cars, over 15. This is the most fun car I had. It handles beautifully and the turbo is just something else on it. It's really fun to drive. Quality is one of the best in my eyes. As long as u take care of it, it will last. It's very well built in my opinion. However, don't take it to Saab dealers when it needs a repair or maintenance, they really charge a lot. B/c they expect u to be rich to own a Saab. Rather, find a private mechanic that is good with Saabs. By the way I get at least 36mpg on the highway, and 25 in the city when I drive fast and 28 when I drive economically. Just don't cut corners with its maintenance, give the car what it requires and it will last. "
saab,9-3,2005,jonathan7482, 11/27/2009,Underrated and Unappreciated,4,"A great all around car, so fun to drive. It seems like you don't even have to think to drive this car. It is humane and a breeze in the city, and can really rip it up on the open road. If it disappears, the 9-3 will go down forever as an underrated, unappreciated, and underpriced car."
saab,9-3,2005,DB, 08/22/2010,Great entry-level luxury,4,"This car has great response and power for day to day driving. On the highway it goes all the way from 35 to 90 quickly, smoothly, and fairly quietly. On the street it handles great and the ESP and ABS keep it safe. Driving this car in Salt Lake City during the winter felt secure, even in a midnight blizzard. I would rather be in this than in a pickup or SUV that might roll over. Interior is bare bones but nails all the little details. Once you get used to the major differences in control location, everything feels exactly right. Lots of room and very comfortable. The Senstronic shifter is very useful when going down a mountain."
saab,9-3,2005,Brian, 07/24/2005,"2005 Saab Arc Convertible, Charlotte, NC",4,"Overall a great car and very pleased with the purchase.  Test drove the BMW 3 series convertible and the Audi A4 convertible, although the performance was not as impressive, the Saab was the most fun to drive.  Tons of interior room and of the three by far the most comfortable interior.  With the roof up, has a true coupe feeling.  I am 6'1 and with the roof up I have tons of headroom.  Did not like the wood trim on the inside of the Arc model and had it changed out for the metal trim.  I personally like the ride of the Arc suspension better than the Aero.  The automatic is great, and the ability to shift the automatic is great for passing.  "

since I enjoy cars that are more 
unique & exciting than just one of a
bland flurry of Euro-Japanese yuppie

The 9-3 Aero carries-forth the SAAB 
tradition of providing many unique but

instrument panel ""Blackout"" button, 4-

between the front seats that also

saab,9-3,2005,befar, 10/04/2005,Gorgeous but unreliable,3,"Let me start with the good.  The car is fabulous to drive.  I have owned Mercedes, Lexus, Honda, and older Saabs in the past and this is by far the most fun car to drive.  It is also more comfortable then most of my friends (they drive BMWs, Mercedes, and Lexus).  Now for the bad, I have had the car less than four months and it is going in for warranty work the SEVENTH time this week.  The total days spent in the shop for various build problems is over 24.  Weather stripping, windows off tracks, A/C issues and leather cracks are just the beginning of the list.  I have 6000 miles on it and can tell you this car only is good if it is not your only source of transportation."

It is an awesome car to drive. I hope the reliability will be there for years to come.

In a loaner from the dealer and it shakes at 70 mph. My car has been in the shop for over a month just because of a simple (I thought) balancing job. But it turns out that it couldn't get fixed, so they had to replace all 4 tires!  Not even a year after my 2nd purchse, I am already planning to trade in after summer. Do not buy a 93 convertible unless you're prepared for it to be in the shop  time after time after time. It's in the shop for 'updates' seems like every month.  If you want a high maintenance car, this one's for you! "

saab,9-3,2005,john, 12/04/2004,Great Car that will last,4,"I have owned a Saab for 10 years.  My wife always used to tease me about driving a suped-up Chevette.  Since the car had a manual transmission, she never drove it.  I always told her my engineering friends loved Saabs, but she did not think much of it.  When we decided to shop for a new car (I still have the old Saab), we considered the Acura TL, BMW 330, Volvo S60, and SAAB 9-3 or 9-5.  She loved the SAAB and we bought a 9-3 Aero with the larger Turbo engine with automatic transmission.  She loves driving it and she calls it her car.  It drives best at around 95mph.  The comfort is great and the trunk space is best in the class.  We are also very pleased with the car's safety record. "
saab,9-3,2005,newsaabowner, 02/11/2005,I'm suprised they don't sell more,4,"I'm new to the SAAB world. I am a car nut. I considered this car based on price.  If I could have afforded it, I would have gotten the 325i.  I didn't want an accord or a camry. In terms of price, this is a similar car to an accord with leather when you calculate the lease.  But the saab gives you soo much more.  You can't beat the safety items on this car..large tire, large brakes, stability control, traction control, #1 in safety both side and frontal. This car is small on the outside, huge on the inside. I got the manual 5 speed.  It's a nice stick...not as nice as the bmw, but nice.  I am tremendously happy with this lease and I'd do it over and over again. Very zippy on the highway!"
saab,9-3,2005,Jon Cox, 05/01/2005,sierra alpha alpha bravo (SAAB),4,"Great handling - powerful when turbo kicks in and luxurious but practical. No gimmicks, just functional, solid and safe! 2005 is deeper and longer, so at 6'5"" I was very pleased to find a convertible that provided me with plenty of head room and leg room, as well as a couple of rear seats so the kids can come along on the ride. A great family convertible!"
saab,9-3,2005,Thayer, 08/14/2005,Gas Mileage,4,"This car has the feel and handling of a car that costs 10K more.  I read much about the sound system being sub- par and went in with the plan of replacing it with a top notch system... truth is it is fine just get the primium sound package.  The turbo makes the steep passes here in Colorado seem like hills and the increased elevations have zero effect on its power (again the turbo).  The car does not burn off the line but at about 40-50 hold on. Handling superior to the Volvo 60, roomier than the Audi 4 and options don't kill your pocket book like the Mercedes C class."
saab,9-3,2005,dso, 08/26/2005,Big improvement,4,"i had an '03 that gave me no problems other than a squeaky top in cold weather. Love ragtops, and was considering Audi, or BMW.  Redceived  SAAB early termination deal, coupled with GM program, which would save me quite a bit, so i looked at the SAAB Aero and fell in love with it.  Black on black is a hot car.  great seats and interior, although I think trunk is smaller. Miss the fold dowm back seat, but it had to be sacrificed for the pop-up rollbars.  Still haven't figured out the displays."
saab,9-3,2005,JTS75, 10/29/2005,Lots of Bang for the Buck,4,"Had my '05 9-3 for a year, and no problems other than a faulty radio which was warrantied without hassle.  It's FWD, so it's just not quite a Bimmer 330 or a A4 Quattro, but then again your not going to get a deal on either of those vehicles like you will on the 9-3 if you look hard enough. Indeed, with that factor considered, I think the Saab is probably the best overall value in the entry-level lux- sport sedan class.  Manual version is a blast to drive and the turbo makes it peppy enough to be fun. Handling is tight and braking is exceptional. Build quality is OK, there's a few cheesy design features that will bum you out a bit. Oh and the stereo is horrific. Other than that, great car!"
saab,9-3,2005,Chris Wright, 12/22/2005,I love this car!!,4,"This car is spunky and fun to drive.  The gas mileage is exceptional on the highway...I get about 32 regularly.  I test drove the BMW 325i, and I liked this car much better...hands down."
saab,9-3,2005,Dian, 06/01/2006,Best Car I Ever Owned,4,"This vehicle is by far the best I've ever owned.  The only things that could top it would be if it had the V6 turbo engine.  It is not as common as the BMW which every other person seems to drive here, so you are more unique when on the road. Unfortunately for me, I have to sell it as I am moving overseas and left hand drive cars are not allowed there.  When I return, I will pick up the latest model via the European Delivery Program so I can once again enjoy the thrill of the Saab Aero convertible.  It is great to drive."

for a challenge, OUT THERE and totally comfortable 
when I just feel like taking a ride home in the 
sunset. With a cup of coffee in the cup holder, and 
some jazz on the high powered stereo, I call it a 
mix between a vehicle and a Peet's Coffee coffee 
shop. Brilliant - again!"
saab,9-3,2005,steve, 04/06/2005,Reason to smile!,5,"This is the fifth Saab I've either owned or leased, and it's without a doubt the most enjoyable. My only complaint is its relatively pokey acceleration. Otherwise, it's great fun, with a nice, controlled ride, strong brakes and all the creature comforts one would expect from a $43000 car. I considered a BMW 330iC as well, but found the local Saab dealership much more agreeable to work with."
saab,9-3,2005,scott, 10/18/2005,Best car ever!,5,I am so happy with my purchace! I bought a ARC Convertible and I still have a smile plastered across my face.

saab,9-3,2005,BBSSaab05, 12/05/2005,Fast and Fun,4,"This is a fun car to drive. Great handling, smooth ride, good acceleration - especially compared to other cars with similar pricing and/or power ratings. The exterior is beautiful and the interior contemporary Swedish minimalist. I have had two minor issues with reliability in 12,000 miles - both electrical. My wife's 4  yr. old Saab has had minor electrical problems and the seemingly common problem of failed throttle body. Dealer service has been beyond expectation including warranteed repairs after the warranty expired. That and the driving experience more than make up for any problems we've had."
saab,9-3,2005,Tim Choppin, 05/12/2006,Great Car!,4,"I purchased the Saab after driving the Audi A4 and the BMW 3-Series.  The BMW really left me cold.  I really liked the Audi driving experience, but the interior was far more cramped and the price for an equivalent trim level was shocking.  The Saab has been fun and generally reliable, with the exception of the rare and mysterious message from the computer about the engine immobilizer.  The car keeps running, so I ignore it.  The top goes down rapidly and the seat heaters allow me to drive top-down whenever the outside temperature hits about 40. The car has plenty of pep.  The rear seats are unique in this class for being truly functional for passengers.  The digital media input jack is nice."
saab,9-3,2005,topdownarc, 06/09/2006,My Swedish Souvenir,5,"I love driving my 9-3 Arc! It handles with ease the secondary, curving roads I drive on daily. (and I like to drive it fast...) It averages 26 MPG on my rural roads. I've had the car almost a year and haven't had any problems with it. It was our second European Delivery purchase and we'll certainly purchase future cars in the same manner."
saab,9-3,2005,BEV WALKER, 08/21/2007,I love my Saab,4,"Excellent except for a few turbo lags.  On a whole, I'm very happy with its performance.

saab,9-3,2005,Robert, 11/17/2007,Very Expensive after Warranty,3,"The car has been a great driving machine.  That's the good.  The bad... right off the start, the car was in the shop numerous times for electrical issues.  The sunroof would not close properly, the windows would not go up, and other misc. electrical issues.  At least they were covered by warranty.  Now, out of warranty, I have the car in the shop at this very moment for the belt and tensioner to be replaced, the solenoid, the filter, and to check the coolent system.  $1200.  Now they just called me and said that the radiator needs replacement at a cost of $1100.  The car has been disappointing in the repairs area.  I have also had to have the brakes and rotors replaced at 40,000 miles."
saab,9-3,2005,young family of 4, 03/23/2008,pleased,4,"The car handles wells.  We were averaging 32 mpg with a lot of highway driving.  The headlight burnt out 3 times in less than 2 years.  The passenger door does not always lock.  The emblem on the hood fell off, as I have seen happen with many others.  We have had to have the arm rest in the center console replaced as well as many of the interior parts because the cheap plastic coating rubs off.  We ended up being ""stuck"" with this car because it has not held its value.  Overall, we have enjoyed the vehicle but would have liked to trade it in for something that fits our 2 car seats better.  A rear-facing car seat requires that the front seat is moved all the way forward."
saab,9-3,2005,Saab fan kk, 04/11/2018,Saab enthusiasts only,3,"Not considerably more maintenance than any other convertible; just mechanics charge more for their services on discontinued brands. Owned Saabs' for most of my driving career. Sad that GM bought the brand then put it out of business. I bought the 2005 Saab 9-3 Aero Convertible used which saved considerable cost. No real major maintenance expenses other than high mile service (30-60-90). It runs hard on teh performance tires. They don't last long which I lament. Interior is simple. GM made plastic buttons have peeled. Original Saab parts lasted forever. Love/hate relationship with a brand that harkens back to speed and safety.

Acceleration is good and great when on the highway.  Large enough to fit me inside, yet small enough to get into a lot of places larger cars can't fit.  This car is fun to drive.  Being an older car, there are always maintenance items here and there, so make sure you have a good mechanic that knows Saabs well.

saab,9-3,2005,KAINALU, 03/22/2005,My NEW Car,4,I've only had my Saab 93 Aero for a little over a month but so far...i love it..no problems and good to drive.
saab,9-3,2005,Matt, 09/09/2005,Engine Failure,3,"The engine on my 2005 Saab 9-3 has failed two times within the first 4900 miles on the odometer.  The first failure occurred in June of 2005 and the problem was diagnosed as a throttle body failure.  The failure results in the car accelerating extremely slow without any prior notice.  The second failure occurred on July 18, 2005 when I was nearly hit making a left hand turn.  The same symptoms presented without any indication that there was a failure about to occur.  So be careful!"
saab,9-3,2005,teacher, 03/23/2008,Not a sports sedan,3,"Don't get me wrong, I like my Saab.  It is safe, reliable, comfy, quick and gets great gas mileage. However, this is not the sports sedan that Saab makes it out to be.  I don't understand how all of these consumers give this car a 9 or 10 in performance. I don't know what they drove before their Saab.  This car is much too soft, leans much too much in corners and turns.  The steering is much too light and there is excessive torque steer.  Bumps in the road upset the suspension and the car never really feels under control when driven quickly.  All of the professional reviews from car magazines and even Consumer Reports agree with me on the handling.  This is NOT a BMW.  Born from Jets?..ha ha"
saab,9-3,2005,jj, 06/07/2005,Saab - Bad Decision,2,"With less than 2600 miles, this car broke down four times.  The fifth time I refused to drive it anymore. I had it towed to the dealer and told them to keep it. During one of the episodes the car just stopped while I was driving, luckily I was in a parking lot and only doing about 15 to 20 mph.  Saab tried to compete with some of the quality manufacturers and put in too many gadgets.  It was tinny and confusing to run.  I knew from the get-go that I had made a mistake but was willing to ride it out.  Unfortunately this car's time ran out in less than six months.  I took a $15,000 hit when I traded this junk in.  Live and learn.  I no longer drive a Saab and NEVER will again."
saab,9-3,2005,RobertB, 01/13/2005,Best of the Best,5,"This car is wonderful. The car fits me like a glove, handles well in snow and ice, sound system is great. The trunk space surprised me on how much it can hold. I've owned many cars over the past 25 years and this Saab convertible is my favorite car of them all."
saab,9-3,2005,Keith, 04/17/2005,Wonderful car,5,"Beautiful, fun to drive, excellent acceleration, handles very well.  Great stereo. Surely the most beautiful of the 4-seater convertibles.  Excellent safety ratings.  Stands out from the dime-a-dozen convertibles out there."

saab,9-3,2005,Hectorg, 06/20/2005,SAAB!!!,5,"Let me start by saying that I also drive a BMW X5. I've had the car for 3 days, I am thrilled with the Saab 93 Aero!! This car looks great, feels great and it is fast! Why doesn't anyone talk about that? I even like the fact that I don't get that much attention, like I do in the X5. Still this car is beautiful. I love the details in the care. Did you see the in dash cupholder? The seats? The wheels? I drove others, like the BMW 3 series, Acura TL. The Saab just has character. Just test drive it, feel that turbo kick in. Right now when I drive around, I notice that I don't see other Saab 93 Aero in Nocture Blue and you know what? I LOVE THAT!!"
saab,9-3,2005,GKellogg, 07/30/2005,Beautiful automobile - blast to drive,4,"I love this car. Aside from being gorgeous, it is exhilarating to drive. With the manual transmission you can really play with the turbo boost which is what makes this (as well as other Saabs) so fun to drive.  The guy with the X5 mentioned he likes not getting as much attention as with his BMW? Nooooooo....lots of stares because its NOT a run of the mill 3-Series that you see on every street corner! Love it."
saab,9-3,2005,Bob, 12/31/2007,Just a Nice Car,3,"My 9-3 has been very reliable with the only problem a couple of burned out headlight bulbs.  The car is quick, quiet, comfortable, safe, nioe looking and extremely fuel efficient. My complaint is the handling. This is NOT the sport sedan  Saab makes it out to be.  The steering is too light, the suspension is too soft, the car leans excessively in turns and loses traction over any road irregularities.  There is plenty of torque steer as well.  ""Born from Jets"", I don't think so.   "
saab,9-3,2005,CARtx478, 01/11/2008,Amazing Value,4,"I bought my first Saab two weeks ago and couldn't be more impressed with a car in this price range.  After a year-long search I found a low mileage black Aero model with a parchment interior.  It's quick (especially at highway speeds) and has a firm, but comfortable ride quality.  I absolutely love the 9-3's styling and relative anonymity on the road."
saab,9-3,2005,notsofast, 01/10/2005,disappointed in build quality & service,4,Took delivery 11/29/04 - after having the car for 26 days it had to spend 11 days at the dealer for repairs (steering wheel lock).  The acceleration is very slow for surface street driving and hesitates badly.  Service also a disappointment.  Car has been in three times to get reprogramming offered by Saab completed.
saab,9-3,2005,beamer12, 03/31/2005,9-3 Arc,4,"Overall great value, excellent design, needs a stiffer suspension.  Also, has a little lag on the turbo."
saab,9-3,2005,Emily, 04/10/2005,Excellent,5,This is a wonderful car.  It is safe and fun to drive- not 2 characteristics that usually come hand in hand with a sedan.  I love the design and it handles well in winters of Buffalo!
saab,9-3,2005,Oblaw, 04/14/2005,Great car,5,The convertible has great gas mileage for the power.  It handles very well and has had no reason for service beyond routine maintenance.
saab,9-3,2005,Joseph G, 04/15/2005,Bare bones facts.,4,"This vehicle is awesome ! I test drove the ""big three"", re: Audi-4, BMW 325CI and the AERO. The AUDI and BMW have the performance issues you may be looking for, but they lack the comfort and driving ease of the SAAB AERO. The SAAB AERO driver seat is much more roomy than the other two, so if your a big man, re: 6 feet or above then your knee will be bruised in the AUDI or BMW. This car is really the only choice for comfort and style. I recommend you test drive all three on the same day to really get a feel for what I am saying. "
saab,9-3,2005,cjcypert, 05/14/2005,Saab 9-3,4,Never thought about owning a Saab until I drove one. Fell in love with it the moment I drove it. Was comparing a Saab 9-3 to an Acura TSX and Mazda6. Saab won hands down.
saab,9-3,2005,happy owner, 05/27/2005,Saab surprise,5,"After selling my old 900s, I looked at VW (Passat), Volvos and Audis. The 900 was okay, but I don't miss it. Then I saw that GM was getting generous with its cash back program, so I decided to give Saab another try. I was glad I did. The interior quality and the handling were better than the Passat or the Volvo v40, and on par with the Audi A4, but 5k cheaper than the Audi. And after cash back, only about 2k more than a VW. The interior and the trunk are larger than any of those competitors, which is great, given the baby seat we recently had to install. The 9-3 offers 99 percent of the quality of a BMW 3 series or Audi A4, but for a lot less money. This car is a steal.  "
saab,9-3,2005,Trevor, 05/27/2005,Another Saab,5,"This is the second Saab I've owned. Once you own one of these things you will never let go. Everyone who sits in it is blown away. I'd take it in a heart beat over all of its competitors, 300c, Audi A4, Volvo s40, this car is way more fun to drive than anything else out there.  Until my first time driving this car I had never seen a smile on someones face from driving, or riding in a car before. Now I grin every time I sit in my car, and so does everyone else, literally. "
saab,9-3,2005,Richard, 05/28/2005,"So Far, So Good",4,"Love the ride, the eurocar-snobs like to put this car's ride down because it is front wheel drive, but do they all live in California where it doesn't snow? Front wheel drive is so much better in snow and wet conditions, I won't buy a rear wheel drive car because of this simple fact.  I like the handling, and I am most surprised at how much power this  turbo 4 cyldr car has, makes for a fun driving experience. "
saab,9-3,2005,Karen Gustin, 05/29/2005,2005 Aero Saab Convertible,4,"So much better than the 2002!  Quieter, sturdier, faster, solid.  Overall, I love this year's model and may not ever get another!"
saab,9-3,2005,Scott, 06/10/2005,OK,3,"Alot of turbo lag unless you are going 60+.  For the price does not come close to the audi or bmw.  Spend the extra 5- 7k and stick with an audi or bmw.  Terrible winter vehicle.  Salespitch noted ""this car is made in sweden"".  Must have made it in the summer."
saab,9-3,2005,corbin, 06/28/2005,Doens't get any better,5,I love this car so much. It handles like it is on rails and feels as solid as a bank vault. The 210 horsepower inline-4 is more than enough power. This car is wonderful at about 85-90mph (quiet and is only reving about 2200 rpm)
saab,9-3,2005,KJ, 07/10/2005,Nice car,5,"We enjoy our new car, it is responsive and fun to drive."
saab,9-3,2005,richard, 07/28/2005,"surprised, fun, quick",4,"I am surprised how much I like this car. I had always had cars with larger engines, so I was pleasantly surprised at the spunk of this 2.0 liter 4 cyl engine, I guess it's the turbo. I enjoy the pick-up, the agility, and the nice handling. contrary to the reviews, the stereo is just fine, and I prefer a front wheel drive car, especially in the northeast USA, where we have snow, and a rear wheel car is never a good idea. "
saab,9-3,2005,Satisfied Customer, 08/16/2005,Finally Did It,4,"I hesitated to spend so much money for this car but my dealer made it easy with a great lease and, of course, the GM Discount.  This car is much better than my old 9-3 even without the hatch back.  I don't even miss it.  My new Arc has a quality look and feel and power when I need it.  And it is a head turner with its Chili Red metallic paint, parchment interior and the 17"" wheel option.  I should have done this sooner.  I look for any excuse to get out and drive it. "
saab,9-3,2005,Yippee, 08/17/2005,SAAB Rocks!!!,5,"I recently purchased an 05 9-3..I'm in Love.  I traded in a much loved SUV and couldn't happier that I am getting 33 MPG now vs. the 16 I was getting in the SUV.  This car is a blast to drive, I fell in love with it as soon as I pulled out for the test drive.  Contrary to what some reviews have said, I get no turbo lag at all - the turbo is best over 80, but also very responsive at lower speeds in 3rd and 4th gear (perhaps they at sissy automatic people).  The seats are a dream.  This car screams refinement.  I've owned BMW's and they are a dine a dozen on the road.. why look like everyone else - if you are like me this car fits your unique personality and sense of style."
saab,9-3,2005,sjr, 10/29/2005,Great!!,5,"I made this purchase after doing a good deal of research.  The 2005 incentive pushed me toward the Saab over the BMW 325 and Acura TL I was looking at.  It turned out to be a great choice regardless.  This is one of the best drives I have ever had.  I highly recommend the 5-speed manual if you can find one and don't mind stick shift.  While the car is still new to me (3000 miles), I am very happy with it.  The turbo really has some go!  A smooth ride with great interior features including an input jack for any iPod fans.  Highly recommended."

Turbo lag although is evident and needs to be addressed.  This is a common complaint.  Interior design of arm rest, use of power door locks are annoying. Cell phone options on steering wheel are not functional as Saab offers no phone accessaries.?  Driven for 12k, glad to have stability control and safety features.  Turbo lag is major issue and if not addressed in future model I would not lease/purchase another.  "
saab,9-3,2005,Geremy, 12/22/2005,Efficient,5,"I have had the car 6 months now and I am very pleased.  I came out of a BMW so I have high standards.  This car is perfect execution of efficent Swedish design.  There is nothing fake about this car, it is pure form and function. The minimalist interior is actually a breath of fresh air for me, especially when every other car is clamoring to confort you like your living room.  Buyers need to keep in mind that the Swedes are not trying to sell image, luxury, or top performance.  This car is constantly compared to BMWs, Audis, and Mercedes, but I think the car is more comparable to a Camry or an Accord.  I bought mine for the same price as a Camry.  No problems to date."
saab,9-3,2005,Rob Aiken, 01/23/2006,Excellent Car,5,"I have owned my 2005 Saab 9-3 Linear for 7 months now and like it more and more everytime I drive it.  Usually when I buy a new car, I start to notice little things about it, that I don't like within a month or 2.  That has not happened with my 9-3.  In fact, the opposite has happened.  I have started to find little things about the 9-3 that I like more after driving it awhile.  The suspension and handling on this car are unbelievable.  My friend owns a 2005 BMW 325i and after driving my car, wishes he had purchased a Saab 9-3 instead.  It is a little cramped in the back seat, but is fine for kids.  Or 3 adults in back for short drives.  I will always buy Saab now and can't wait for my 9-7x."

SAAB incorporates many safety features, some of 
which would cost you extra on other cars.There is 
an active head restraint system built into the front 
seat headrests that I don't think any other car 
maker includes at all. I am a car nut and I was very 
impressed when I drove The SAAB for the first time."

saab,9-3,2005,Jim, 02/20/2005,Jim,5,Absolultely incredible vehicle. The drive/ride is superb; the handling is absolutely the BEST and the safety is above all others.  The interior electronics are far superior to any vehicle in its class and all controls are within easy reach.  We checked at least 10 other supposedly comparable brand-names before visiting Saab and we were convinced the Arc was THE BEST after 30 minutes of explanation on its safety features and a test drive. 
saab,9-3,2005,John, 03/14/2005,Boring,4,"The electronics in the car don't seem to be all that reliable, but everything else is aesthetically nice and comfortable.  One specific problem I found is the new rotors they installed in the '03 and newer are too thin andneed to be replaced much too often. Very fun to drive though, especially the 6 speed."
saab,9-3,2005,Jvalerio, 03/19/2005,I love my Saab!,5,"I have nothing but positive things to say about this car. It is reliable, and great fun to drive.

I fell in love with my black on black Aero Saab.  I think it's much more stylish than the Audi.  I felt the BMW inside wasn't as special as the Saab and everything was another fee.  My Aero Saab has every extra I could want and more.  Drive one today and you'll have a new love too!
saab,9-3,2005,JAIMEB, 04/05/2005,highlands,4,"I bought this car in central Mexico in the city of San Luis we are 6000ft or more over sea level like all the region, in these highlands the turbo shines, my first option was a BMW325 but for ten grand less and a better financial offer I get this one. 

The testdrive - _ cant believe the huge diference in response between both cars the turbo is fast and has a killer gas milleage.  The BMW is more refined but not for the $10k gap in a similarly equipped car.  The Saab for me has a very unique personality and performs like an a wolf in a sheep clothes.  The quality - I only have a minor problem with a coolant drop that was corrected under warranty, good buy."
saab,9-3,2005,C-ville Saab, 04/23/2005,Why did I wait so long to buy it?,4,"After owning 4 Saturns in the past 13 years I switched brands and bought a 2005 Saab 9-3 Arc. The sales transaction was as stress-free as any of the Saturn transactions and the final price was better than I had expected. The Saab is a beauty to look at and a hoot to drive. I thought that my 2003 L300 handled well, but not compared to the 9-3. It is quick, agile and smooth. I have a 15 mile daily commute through the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the 9-3 accelerates freely and handles the curves with no discernible body lean. I can point the car into fast sweepers early and it powers through with very little understeering. My only question is, ""Why did I wait so long to buy it?"""
saab,9-3,2005,lbh, 05/09/2005,Can't stop driving....,4,"I had a great car before - a 300HP V6 Infiniti - and this 210HP inline 4 is more fun.  Pure excitement when the turbo kicks in as the power band is just awesome.  Wait till you hit about 40 mph and then you will fly - much quicker to 80 mph than one would think!  I LOVE the interior - not as Saab as the past - but still Saab, Swedish simplicity and minimalism.  I admit to having a few rattles and the brakes emit a squeal in reverse.  But my enjoyment of my 9-3 is pure.  "
saab,9-3,2005,Chaz, 05/10/2005,9-3 Turbo...dare to compare!,4,"I test drove all of the European imports in this class, and the Saab 9- 3 offers perky performance, nice handling, and great gas mileage. If you drive a lot, the manual seeting with multiple adjustments is better than any electric seating system I have had in the past. The factory sound system leaves a lot to be desired.  The on-board computer systems are functional and informational without being intrusive.  Plenty of rear seat room for adults as well as children without having to ""move the seats up"" for rear passengers.   Dollar for dollar, a great performer and great investment! "
saab,9-3,2005,C Tower, 05/19/2005,Saab 9-3,4,"After years of Japanese cars I decided to go for something different, I am so glad I did. The handling is so much tigher and exact. I love the manual feature of my automatic transmission, it gives me more control and it feels as if there is much more power than there really is."
saab,9-3,2005,LBH, 05/20/2005,Fun. Period.,4,"This car is just plain European fun.  It is not a BMW, it is not an Audi, it is not a Volvo - it is a Saab.  Through good and bad, it is a Saab.  The turbo is a trip - wait till the turbo spools -  up to about 40 mph and then the car will simply take off and suddenly you will be doing 80 without even a blink.  I LOVE the interior, very minimalist, very Swedish.  The 9-3 is not for everyone.  It does not drive as well as a 3-series.  The interior is great, but most will like the A4 better.  The woodgrain is not as nice as a Jaguar.  But I still love my Saab.  The rakish front end, the smooth lines, the cockpit interior.  Take it for a drive, you will either love it - or you'll buy a Beemer.  "
saab,9-3,2005,Ron, 06/04/2005,My First Convertible,5,"Briefly, this is a well-built car with a great fit and finish. The trunk will hold 2 golf bags with the top up and 4 passengers comfortably. Along with its 5 star safety rating, convenient controls and good looks, what else would you want in a convertible? "
saab,9-3,2005,bostonsaabfan, 06/08/2005,What a rush!,5,"I was initially a little skeptical about leaving the safe but bland world of Japanese made cars, but after just a test drive in the 9-3, I remembered how much fun driving is!  The other reviews that mention the rush that comes from 40-70 mph are right on.  This car has been a pure joy to drive.  I have a friend with a BMW 3-series, and in terms of comfort, interior and trunk room, competent snow handling (as I anticipate for next winter), and overall cost, the Saab 9-3 seems a hands-down winner."

Three months later, I am nothing but thrilled with my new Saab 9-3 Arc.  The turbo and pep are incredible.  Every so often I look down at the spedometer and freak out because I somehow got it up to 80 without realizing it.  The seats are very comfortable and the smooth but tight ride surpass anything I anticipated.  After a roadtrip through New England, my boyfriend confessed he liked my car better than his Audi.

This large sedan gets better MPG than my Focus, and has performance when needed. The seats are comfortable, standard with leather. "
saab,9-3,2005,Patty, 07/28/2005,Couldn't be happier!,5,We purchased this car for our 16 year old son. He always wanted the SAAB convertible. Driving it is an amazing experience. You hate to reach your destination. Heads turn the entire time it's on the road. We feel good about it's high safety standards. We test drove ALL convertibles - this one is the best the others cannot compare.
saab,9-3,2005,chuxley, 08/02/2005,Best Car I've Owned,5,"I have purchased some 40 cars in the past three decades - everything from large Buicks to SUVs to a Mercedes- Benz.  Among those 40 cars were eight Saabs - one of the old ones we still own, purchased new in 1989.  But... this 2005 9.3 Linear is the best one yet.  Having just come back from a 2500 mile road trip, I can report fantastic performance, 33 mpg for the entire trip - at speeds up to 100 mph, and absolute comfort.  The A/C is finally terrific in Saabs.  And, the Saab seats eliminate fatigue like no other.  This is a great, quiet, smooth machine.  I am really glad I bought it."
saab,9-3,2005,Bill, 08/06/2005,Sold on SAAB!,4,"I have had the SAAB 93 Linear with manual transmission for about six months and I love it.  The pick-up is great! The ride is so smooth that crusing at 85-95 is like driving 55. I have to remember to check the speedometer or it would easily break 100. Considered buying a comparable Volvo, but the handling on the SAAB to the Volvo was so dramatic that Volvo was eliminated on the first test drive.    "
saab,9-3,2005,Ken G, 09/07/2005,Great sport luxury value,4,"Coming off lease of a MB C230K coupe/hatch, I wanted 4 doors, a real trunk, front or AWD (for winter), and lower price while retaining as much of the sportiness and luxury car experience as possible. In my first few days with the 9-3 Linear, it reminds me a lot of the C240 4Matic that the MB dealer often gave me as a service loaner. My impression of that car always was ""not as fun as the C230 but a bit more practical and very livable."" Now I have the same benefits for $10k less than a new C240 and $4k less than I paid for the C230 almost 4 years ago. Pricing is more comparable to Accord or Camry but with more safety equipment, free maintenance, premium dealer experience and smaller exterior."
saab,9-3,2005,AZ, 09/08/2005,Fun to Drive,4,"Just drove to Long Island, NY from Michigan and it was great.  Handling, driving performance - especially on curves was excellent, a fun car to drive. Gas mileage was 35 mpg. "

Had not thought much about a Saab at the time but was unimpressed by any of the GM, Ford, Chrysler cars. The incentives made the Saab affordable for us. Extremely happy with performance and design. This car has brought back the fun in driving. Have almost 4000 miles on the car and like it better each day."

Electronics seem to fail often:  Check engine light for fuel cap, intermittant failure of traction control, poor explination and exceution of customizable features (door/truck lock options, etc.) Local dealer (ohio) very poor service.  Great value considering GM Employee Pricing Event when purchased.  Suspension too soft, handling plows a little."
saab,9-3,2005,Tim W, 03/06/2006,After a year. . .still in love,5,"I have had my Saab for a full year and over 24000 miles, and it still performs as if I had bought it last month.  My regular commute takes me on highways, city streets, and curvy backroads and my Saab handles each with alacrity, even in poor weather conditions.  I am attracted to Saab for the trifecta of great performance, ample trunk space, and comfortable passenger room; it is rare to find all three in a single vehicle!  As far as reliability issues, I have had only two minor issues in a year: a torn door gasket (which was my own fault) and a faulty sensor on the external temperature guage which did not hamper performance.  My dealership fixed both promptly and under warranty."

Plenty of power, comfort and quiet on the road. Wonderful hwy driver. On interstate trip of 213 mi. at 70 to 80+ mph I got 34+ mpg. Mixed is 25/26 and mostly town and short trips is 22/24.  "
saab,9-3,2005,GJP, 09/23/2006,Great car,4,"Very nice clean interior. Runs very well on the highway. If you drive in a lot in traffic, get the auto.  It also has great a/c. The more options you get, the more confusing the driver controls become but for 07 they have simplified everything with a new dash and radio. The car gets better mpg than its rated mpg on the highway.  Great all around car."
saab,9-3,2005,Michelle, 02/01/2007,Great car for the money!,5,All around great car. Gas mileage is higher than expected. I average 26/35 with very good passing power. This is the first Saab I have driven and it impressed me so much that I bought it on the spot.

Car has been getting awesome gas mileage (32 MPG highway), has been relatively reliable (3 burnt headlights in 14 months but other then that perfect) and is very comfortable and fun to drive.  One thing I would like to caution is maintenance after free period becomes very expensive.  My biggest complaint is this car does not hold its value at all.  I have received offers of less then half the original purchase price from several different dealers, including original dealer, for trade in. The car is only 14 months old and is in showroom condition. It lost 13K in 14 months. GM discounts :("

Sweet performance, smooth shifting, and terrific comfort and mileage are all part of the package.  Even with ""only"" 175 horsepower, it has pickup aplenty.  The control layout is excellent, and I love the Night Panel, manual transmission and console-mounted ignition.  Those who whine about the ignition should drive one for three weeks, and they'll get used to it.  Besides, who wants a key in their knee in an accident??  All in all, I LOVE my Saab."

saab,9-3,2005,Andy, 10/11/2007,"Fun to drive, but mostly to the mechanic",3,"A great car to drive!  Unfortunately, much of that driving was back and forth to the dealership for constant minor repairs.  The engine was generally reliable and the handling was great, but the interior was cheaply built and little things kept breaking.  I am convinced that the electrical system was possessed; I had problems with the taillights, the stereo, the alarm, the dome lights, and the dash display, all within a 6-month period.  All things considered, this is NOT a car I would wish to keep after the warranty expires."
saab,9-3,2005,perks77, 06/08/2007,"A blast to drive, but at a cost",3,"I had fond memories of my '83 Saab 900.  That car was a tank and simply refused to be driven into the ground.  My '05 9-3 has all the gutsy handling the old models did (and then some!), looks great, is quite comfortable and is surprisingly roomy for a car of its size.  For a little 4-banger, it really zips along once the turbo kicks in! However, I've had the car in the shop REPEATEDLY for random electrical and mechanical problems that simply should not happen at 30K miles.  Some of the interior finish is cheaply done and parts have decided to fall apart at random.  This has left me so disappointed that I plan to trade it in as soon as possible."
saab,9-3,2005,JRMNJ, 12/09/2019,9-3 ARC Convertible is a fantastic car!,5,"My 2005 9-3 Convertible is the best all around vehicle I've ever owned and I've owned plenty.  I purchased my 42k miles 2005 ARC in 2009 for my wife. She wanted her own convertible seeing that I have both a BMW 645 ci and a C5 Corvette. After owning the 9-3 now for 11 years, the vette for 20 and the BMW for 10 I can say that the SAAB is in a class of its own. 

I've only had to put tires, oil, spark plugs, head lights/ tail lights, battery, new gas cap and gas in the SAAB after 148k miles. There was a factory recall on front springs but other than that this car has been flawless. 

Very low maintenance costs, extremely reliable, great in snow and fun to drive on sunny days.  These cars perform well enough with the 2.0 Turbo but that are by no means quick or fast.  They drive as nicely as one should expect from a 210hp executive car. 

My one complaint...the crummy interior laminate over dash buttons. The UV rays and moisture get to them and many have started to peel. The shifter selection panel being the worst. The driver seat has worn at this point and could use a replacement bottom cover. Other than that this vehicle is outstanding. 

I've since purchased my wife a 2017 Wrangler Unlimited CHIEF which she adores...so the SAAB is now mine.  I still have the 645ci which if so was not mechanically inclined would have cost me a fortune in repairs at this point. The C5 is a garage queen, the BMW my summer driver and the SAAB...she's driven every season, sun, rain or snow and as reliable as a Swiss watch.

Love the buttons, once you get used to them the entire car is extremely convenient to operate. Love the white with black trim leather sport seats, extremely comfortable. Great car in the city with the blind spot pass. mirror, drivers information center up top on the dash  quick glance and your back to traffic, acceleration, compass, display  rear parking sensors, and the car itself is easy to see around you. I love driving in the snow, traction control is set perfectly for ice and the tiptronic shift is easy to slow down. The car is a ton of fun driving through the mountains. Cool keys!"
saab,9-3,2006,Matt, 01/25/2016,Best Every Day Driver I Have Owned,5,"I bought my 2006 9-3 with a manual transmission 5 years ago with 70k miles on it.  I now have 130k miles on it.  It is by far the best every day driver I have owned. It handles great in all weather conditions and is extremely reliable. I have not had any breakdowns, it gets good mpg, has good acceleration, and again handles great!  I have done regular maintenance using the recommended Mobile 1 full synthetic European blend oil every 5k miles as well as some normal wear and tear items on a 100k mi car ei: brakes, rotors, and a clutch.  All electronics and mechanical items on the car still work like new.  If you are looking for a used vehicle that is reliable and fun to drive, I would strongly recommend the Saab.

When running properly this car is a delight.  As good as any on the road.  Everything on it is high quality and the engine and transmission are rock solid.  2.  As it ages the electrical parts start to go; crank sensor, ignition parts, etc.  Small stuff but PITA to stay on top of.  3.  Bushings.  Again with age the bushings in the suspension wear out and the car gets sloppy.  Replacement is reasonable.  4.  Battery.  This car is VERY sensitive to voltage.  If you don't have a 100% battery it will do all sorts of weird stuff.  Get one that has a bit more cranking power than the original.  5.  This car needs really good tires for winter conditions.  Studded is probably best if you live where there is snow and ice.

saab,9-3,2006,RandyV, 11/11/2009,GREAT Car!!!!!!,4,"I bought my 2006 SAAB 9.3 Aero with the optional touring package and 2.8l Turbo engine.  I love it.  At the time of my purchase I shopped around and bought a top of line platinum warranty for the car, covering all repairs, from bumper to bumper...Great choice.  Although to date I have not had to use the policy it, but it certainly removes any concerns about expense repair costs in the future.  Now let's talk about the car.   I have looked extensively at BMW, Audi, Lexus and Acuras but settled on this car.  It drives well, looks fabulous and no matter how bad my day is at work....settling in my SAAB for the ride back home, reminds me of Christmas day and playing with my favorite toy!!!!!"

The 2.0T is plagued w/sensor probs that throw the car into limp home mode.
Bought my 2.0T in Nov w/69k miles & it's been in the shop 2X & will be going again next week.
I've only put 2500 mi on it. But I digress, this review is for the '06 Aero. The car was perfect for me. Sold it with 116k mi & it was still running beautifully. Needed a new radiator & some minor suspension repairs but the car still moved like it did when i bought it w/31k mi in 2008. Selling the 2.0T to look for another '06 Aero with the button dash. Feel like I gave up a child in August. haha"
saab,9-3,2006,cptab, 12/05/2006,"Fun, but if you like audio, avoid '06",4,"I found this car fun to drive.  It is peppy and corners well.  Great torque/power.  Unfortunately, the overall fit and finish is not great.  If you like buttons and knobs, you'll love the '06.  Though I like the heads up display on the '06, it renders the dash's radio display almost 100% irrelevant.  Apparently, the H-up display was removed for '07.   The 300w Infotainment system (w/o nav.) on the 2006 Aero is a joke.  The power is placed towards the front which renders the rear speakers and 'subwoofers' powerless.  The bass is muddled and there is really nothing you can do to replace the system."
saab,9-3,2006,neuchy, 02/12/2013,2006 Saab Aero,4,"The car drives beautifully. The ride is firm, sporty firm that is. Some may find it uncomfortable on the cracked roads of Michigan. Performance wise, the car will provide more power than you'll ever need. Don't be surprised if you find yourself driving at 110mph the first week or two you get it. The ride is so smooth you don't even realize you're driving at high speed. The acceleration is simply astonishing. Whether you're already driving at 70 or 30mph you'll feel the same phenomenal pull!
I have been able to drive the car on all surfaces and I must say it handles horribly on the snow. I ended up facing the wrong direction when I took a Michigan left (at only 5mph!!!)"
saab,9-3,2006,neal747, 08/26/2010,Aero Convert,5,"I bought this car used a year ago and it has been great fun. Sporty and luxurious with lots of convenience features. A solid performer the v6 turbo packs a nice punch and the 6 speed automatic shifts better and quicker than I could, so I never feel required to use the paddle shifters. The variable valve timing really opens up the motor under full throttle as it lets out a ferocious scream. Yet quiet and extremely smooth in typical driving. And Saab stands behind the product, they did a free major repair for me even though the car was 5,000 miles past the warranty period! Massey Saab of Orlando is the best."
saab,9-3,2006,steve, 09/14/2005,I love it,4,"It may not be fair to rate this car yet, as I just picked it up 3 days ago.  So far, it is my favorite car ever.  It is very sporty with quick pick-up.  Sound system and interior design are excellent.  I am surrounded by air-bags.  No oil change for 15000 miles (or more) and other than tire rotation every 5000, all maintenance is covered including roadside assistance. Trunk space is excellent.  I think I am a Saab owner for life."

It was totaled 10.2018 and I miss it. 167k with no end in sight. The withstood am almost no warning T-bone (to another illegally passing vehicle) with grace and safety. all air-bags deployed, front end crumpled and I walked away with only minor airbag burn on my wrist.

The previous owner kept it in excellent condition and I think we got a terrific price at less than 1/2 of it's original price. The car is solid, the doors are heavy, outside noise is minimal and the road noise is less than our Volvo S60. The stick shift is smooth and the steering tracks very tight with minimal lean in the turns. The top is a marvel to watch and is water tight while driving.  The trunk space is flexible so if you need more space put up the top. I am 6'2"" and I can fit in the back seat fine. The seats are more comfortable than our previous Mercedes."

This car is completely at home while cruising at the 133mph gov.  The magazines trash Saab for a couple reasons that stem from the FWD.  It will never have the feel of a RWD BMW, but its great for a FWD.  The shifter is fine untill you are speed shifting when it becomes a little slow.  This and it's at the limit handleing are not up there with the BMW, but during spirited driving you'd never know it.  It is only when one thrashes the car through a small road course, like the magazines do, that one would see the difference.

The 9-3 Aero fits the bill very well.  It's extremely comfortable, very sporty, and gets amazing gas mileage.  I'm getting 29 mpg on the highway.  Midrange power seems limitless.  It's every bit as enjoyable to drive on twisty back roads as the WRX was, but with a whole lot more luxury.  I've had a couple of common minor problems over thee past 3 months, but all were fixed by the dealer - their service dept has been second to none.  The stereo in the Aero is pretty good  but not quite up to the level I expect from a premium brand."

In a few words: I regret buying this car and I do not recommend it. Don't forget, all NEW cars ride nice at the beginning but not all stay that way."
saab,9-3,2006,Pete, 10/26/2006,Second Time Around,4,"Although I've only put about 500 miles on this car (has cold weather & premium packages) I must say there is an enormous difference between it and the car it replaces, my 2003 Saab SE convertible. The handling, style, fit and finish are all superior. The added weight combined with improved responsiveness to driver inputs give this vehicle a much more ""european"" feel. Simply put, this car is fun to drive."

Nice power off the line that gets better as the turbo kicks in.  Very solid on the road with nice road manners.  Nice look to 9-3 Aero.  Interior comfort is good.  Seats are supportive and comfortable.  Headrests are functional and lower back support of the seats is excellent. Back seat is usable even with decent sized adult in front (6- 0). HID's are excellent. Finish and fit of the car are very good.  No annoying rattles or other noises.  Car makes commute more enjoyable.  Daughter thinks the car is cool!

I picked my silver 9-3 over an Accord, Legacy, TSX, S40, and Mercury Milan. I purchased the car used/ certified with 20k miles on it from a local Saab dealer. Some have mentioned that Saabs aren't common however where i live they are very popular due to the dealers rapport with its' customers. The car is a wonderful value and there's very few, if any, cars in this segment that compare.  The car is a blast to drive has great fuel economy, and i love the styling both inside and out.

Also the Saab logo on the trunk wore off - how dumb is that. Other than those things everyone who has driven my car loves it.

It corners great, steering is very responsive, great visibility, great brakes and the lower front end makes you feel like your part of the road. The reputation this car has for safety was the deciding factor for me. A car that can make me grin like this and have such a great safety record is just what the doctor ordered. By all means if your looking for a sports sedan thats fun to drive test drive the Aero, you wont regret it."

As the first new car I bought for myself out of college, I wanted something that would last me for years, get good gas mileage, and was fun to drive.  So far, so good!  The gas mileage is pretty good, I average about 28 mpg in the winter.  The styling is nice, but the interior is a little bland.  My biggest complaint would have to be the brakes.  I had to replace them far too early in my opinion, and was told that Saab had changed the braking ratio without changing the brakes.  Not cool.  The top speed in first gear is also quite low, little oomph until 2nd.  Otherwise, none of the problems others have had, such as electrical and whatnot. "

Only thing is moonroof wanting to stick in tilt mode. Fit and finish not quite up to BMW/Audi/Benz standards, but then again, this car was a hell of a lot cheaper with comparable equipment."
saab,9-3,2006,Jyerka, 10/29/2006,5000 MIles - Better Than Expected,4,"I have driven this car enough to know that I am very happy with my choice. The car looks sharp, it handles great, and is well engineered. I had previously heard that the suspension is too soft and that the turbo doesn't feel right. I'm fairly picky, and I think the suspension is perfect for casual or ""aggressive"" driving. The turbo seems fine to me, though this is my first car with turbo. The cargo area is very useful - I needed this for work, and it holds plenty. The folding seats, cargo cover, and nets are logically set up and functional. "
saab,9-3,2006,disappointed, 12/03/2006,Easy on the Plastic,4,"Overall, this car is a fantastic value - great styling, fun to drive, very safe, nice handling, surprising power.  I get compliments constantly about how great the car looks.  However, I am very disappointed with the interior build quality.  Can a car have any more plastic than this one?  The arm rest on the door, the steering wheel, underneath the steering column, the gear shift, you name it.  Because of all the plastic, there is a lot of rattling noise. "
saab,9-3,2006,Mark, 05/22/2007,Saab repair,2,10K miles summary: - coolant reservoir broken - ABS pump replaced - air bypass valve replaced - software that control windows updated - HID leveling system replaced  The car cannot survive a week without having to spend another week at the dealership. we made more miles on the courtesy cars than on our 9-3.

Ride was rough over uneven payment and worse over bumps. Replaced Michelin tires with Pirelli Cintarano’s and ride improved quite substantially. Would definitely buy one again.

saab,9-3,2006,HeatherVT, 07/11/2007,I thought there was snow in Sweden,4,"Although the 9-3 wagon is sporty and comfortable, the snow performance leaves much to be desired.  The ground clearance is so low even a dusting of snow made driving treacherous (despite studded snow tires).  The front wheel drive did little to propel the car through the mountainous roads in Vermont, leaving me stranded in driveways and scared on the highway.  The seats are comfortable but close together, allowing my toddler to kick my elbow while driving.  The trunk is small, not able to accomodate a bike trailer.  Although the seats are comfortable they are very close together so my toddler can kick my elbow as I drive.  The trunk was too small to accommodate a bike trailer."
saab,9-3,2006,notstock, 10/31/2011,OOPS Wrong car.,3,"Well I got suckered by the lure of a 'Good deal"" I needed a cheap family vehicle and I found a 2006 SportCombi Aero with 56K miles for only 11.5K, paid cash and now I know why it was so cheap.
It started having problems on the way home from buying the stupid car.
It's got this weird surging hesitation under partial throttle.
A grinding clanking from the engine, and a weird high pitched whine from the audio system even if it's turned off.
This is a one owner dealer maintained car with full service records, so I know it was taken care of. I'm really disappointed because I liked the performance in a car that I don't see dozens of every day.
UNIQUE, I like that.
Unreliable and broken NOPE."

No changes in acceleration, steering or braking. Warrantied service included tightening some bolts on rear door (after driving over road construction for three months, lots of vibration). Cargo space is very useful, the folding seats have saved me many times. I actually use the retractable cargo cover, when leaving valuables in the car or groceries in the sun. Everyone loves the seats, very comfortable (I am 6'3"") I also have the Thule roof rack- low profile aero bars mounted on factory rails and Big Mouth bike racks, excellent. "
saab,9-3,2006,maxedsaab, 02/04/2009,So far so good,4,"I hope that this will provide a bit of a longterm insight.  My SportCombi has 32000 miles now.  It is still a blast to drive.  Always leaves me with a smile.  Tested multiple cars prior to this choice. Traded in a 2003 Passat wagon.  Love practicality of this wagon and it has a great profile.  Drove A3, A4, BMW 325x, Mazda6 wagon, and none were perfect. Chose Saab for a couple of reasons, cost, fun to drive, practicality and style. No major headaches, just some minor quirks, such as the keys needing reprogrammed.  I was afraid at first that the interior may not hold up, but it has. Original Pirelli tires stunk, have new Potenzas and it is night and day.  All and all very pleased."
saab,9-3,2006,Nataliya, 10/14/2009,Buying Saab was the worst decision of my,3,"I can say now confidently that buying Saab from GM was the worst decision we made with my husband so far in our lives! The car design is simply put flawed, the car is constantly breaking and each morning you are praying that your 3-year old nice looking car will start. I had 6 battery problems  each time it is something new around the battery: faulty switch, wires, corrosion, alternator, throttle motor is draining it... 5 issues with coolant system, my AC was passing smoke into the cabin since antifreeze was leaking into AC system, ESP failure, faulty gas cap, etc. Not mentioning constantly peeling exterior, cracking knobs on the dashboard, leaking washer nozzles and tank..."
saab,9-3,2006,saabian, 01/24/2010,GREAT CAR,4,I recently got this car for a Christmas present from my parents. I'm seventeen years old and previously had a 2005 accord. So far I loooove the Saab. It drives like a dream and has wonderful gas mileage. All my friends love my car. It doesn't take long to get used to the ignition in the console but leaving your sunroof open while raining it could cause a problem.

The love affair definitely continues with this car.  From the quirky center console ignition (thank's for keeping it!) to the outstanding performance, to the polished sophisticated look of the hard boot... it's all good.  What a great car!"
saab,9-3,2006,Jake, 04/02/2006,A Great Driving Experience,4,"I love to drive this car.  I look for any excuse to get out of the house and always take the long way home.  The car drives like a dream.  I gave my 2005 Saab 9-3 Arc with automatic transmission to another family member for this car with 6-speed transmission.  What a difference!  As good as the Arc was, this car makes me feel like I'm driving again.  The subtle differences with engine, suspension and tuning make a huge improvement in the driving experience."
saab,9-3,2006,B. Rich, 06/22/2006,9-3 convertible,4,"This is my second Saab, but first convertible. I absolutely LOVE it. 2006 engine much smoother than my 2003 Sedan, both 2.0 Turbo.  It is so much fun to drive, and the seats are a perfect fit. Had a slight rattle with the top down, and my dealer solved the issue within a hour. I am now a confirmed Saab owner. "
saab,9-3,2006,N Duck, 09/08/2006,Excellent car!,5,"Having two small, sporty cars (Contour SVT and Focus SVT), I had been looking for a car with more room that still had a sporty  feel to it. This car has it all. Lots of room, plenty of power and smooth torque from the V6 twin turbo, and great handling. Added bonus - no torque steer, (and very quiet, especially compared to the Fords). It is very easy to go faster than you think in this car, so watch out!  Fusion Blue paint is really good looking, and the seats are extremely comfortable as well as attractive.  EPA estimate is 18/28 for this car (6 speed manual). So far I am getting around 18 in town, and got about 29 mpg on a 1000 mile trip.  No quality problems after 1600 miles."
saab,9-3,2006,Sanjay, 11/01/2006,Pretty awesome,4,"Just bought a 2006 9-3 sedan two weeks ago.  Everytime I drive it I end up going over 90 mph because I can hardly tell how fast the car is moving.  I am going twice the speed limit on on and off ramps to the highway just to feel the car handle.  It is an incredible ride.  My only comments on improvement are: (1) the radio is terrible, and I have the premium package with an ""upgraded"" radio; (2) road noise - for a luxury sedan, it is a bit loud on the highway, even when you're only going 55 mph; (3) the steering wheel should be wrapped in leather, not the plasic/rubber material; and (4) the bottom of the front seats are too squishy.  Otherwise, I am in love with my new car."
saab,9-3,2006,normb359, 11/26/2006,20 years and getting better,5,This is my 5th Saab.  I just have driven nothing but saabs since 1980.  This car is by far the best yet.  I am getting 30 mpg on hte highway and the preformance is great.  Remembering this is a midsize car and not a sports car.  Drives and handles very well. 
saab,9-3,2006,Ricky Sein, 10/09/2009,My 20 cents,4,"I bought the 2006 9-3 Aero in 2009.  It had 22,000 miles.  The car looks very nice, it's lots of fun to drive.  It is faster than most of the similar priced European makes (which are usually more expensive).  The 2-tone leather interior with silver trims look sporty and modern.  The 2.8 V6T does consumes significant amount of fuel, which can add up, specially if you follow the owner's manual requirement of premium fuel only.  Overall, I love it!  "

I finally bought the car last week, and in love with it. can't stop thinking about it. I didn't know, driving a car could be this much fun. I also have an 02 525i, and it delivers its own fun, but the sheer driving pleasure that this car provides is out of the ordinary. There is plastic all around is because the car needs to be light on its feet like Acura RDX. "
saab,9-3,2006,Keenan walker, 10/17/2015,Saab 9-3 2006,4,"Loved my Saab 9-3, 2.0T 06.  This car was easy to maintain DIY for basic stuff like plugs oil brakes struts etc.  sensors can go haywire if u tool around in the wrong places so be careful while working around any electronics.  I disabled my traction control when I lowered it by shorting one of the abs hub sensor wires, was horrible. Turbo lag is not bad at all, keep it on the pipe and you will be good.  Very controllable chassis especially after strut upgrade and lowering springs.  Bottom line, if u want something extravagant and pretty go by a bmw or an Audi, this car handles I've smoked RWD cars after their drivers talk a bunch of crap about oversteer this and blah blah that.  Great car, sensor faults will happen, get tech 2 or obd2 with CAN to scan the ecu and see where any problems might be.  Major repairs are costly , so be warned have a wad of cash to own one of these.  Cheers

saab,9-3,2006,Chris, 11/21/2005,New Wagon,5,"My wife and I were looking for a sporty station wagon.  While we liked the BMW 3 wagon, no way was it worth $10K more.  I thought the Saab was more fun to drive  turns out it weighs 500 lbs less with the same power.   The car really feels tight and quick.  The Saab quirks like the center console ignition give it character and separate it from the generic feel of the Japanese and American designs."

I traded-in a Mini Cooper S for my 9-3 SportCombi Aero and my new Saab is more fun to drive.  The performance of the new 2.8L V-6 is all I could ever want.

saab,9-3,2006,Michelle, 05/31/2008,Inconvenient,4,"I love to drive this car. It is fast, it responds well, and is very comfortable.  However, I have had many problems since day 1. It came with a bad battery which died the day after I bought it.  There was a recall on the coolant tank which I wasn't informed about; had to wait until my hood was smoking to find out.  The saab service agents don't care and fail to inspect my entire car when I bring it in, so I have to keep going back.  Speakers are fuzzy.  Just replaced another battery and a corroded switch. Seems like there is always something wrong with it.  I now have to replace the front and rear break pads and rotors at 36,000 miles. "
saab,9-3,2006,Rhonda, 07/19/2008,Sticking By It!,4,"OK, so the driver door of my Aero Sedan may have a prickly little habit of coming loose and nearly falling off unless I tighten the bolts every few weeks, but I'm chalking it up to charm. Really. I've owned Acuras up until buying this Saab, and sure those will get you where you want to go, but they just don't have the same kick and flair of this car. I truly love driving it and that counts for something in the trend of mundane cars and dull driving experiences. "
saab,9-3,2006,Theo, 09/06/2008,Everything seems GREAT to me!,4,"Not certain about some critical reviews here but I've had no problems so far and am having a great time driving this vehicle.  Plenty of headroom (6'3""), which was one of the main selling points for me - had trouble with just about any other car/vehicle (even my brother in law's Escalade).  This vehicle has superb ergonomics and comfort with handling and performance that does not disappoint.  I was cross shopping against an Audi A3 but honestly, there is no comparison (other than the Audi's superior DSG transmission - would have loved one of those in this car).  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a great handling, powerful and good looking ""wagon""."
saab,9-3,2006,ChrisJ, 12/29/2008,Attractive and fun midsize wagon,4,"The Aero Sportcombi is a car that gets overlooked too often in favor of the 3 series and the A4 Avant (both more $$). Which is too bad, this is a great looking and performing little wagon. I had the opportunity to drive the 2.0T and Aero quite aggressively at the Aero Academy and was impressed with the cars dynamics. Power from the smooth turbo V6 (a Wards 10-best engine) is plentiful, and I find myself shifting 1-2-4 or even 1-2-6 as the speed builds quickly. Very minimal turbo lag and torque steer. Cargo room is on par with many mid-sized SUVs. Fuel economy is good for a V6: high 20s hwy, low 20's city. Throw some cross bars onto the roof and you've got a capable home depot runner too."

(~50Kmiles) Turbo is excellent now that I have moved to Denver (5500ft.). I can drive it in the snow easily- advantage being I grew up in the snow, I was more worried about having 17"" wheels. No mechanical or electrical problems, exterior and interior have held up well against rough use. No change in gas mileage, I saw an increase when moving to CO (not sure why). Useful tools and jack, I use the cargo cover at trail heads. Only worry is brakes are weak for about 30 seconds after starting car, weird."
saab,9-3,2006,CMC, 09/08/2009,"Details, details, details!!!",3,"Bought used in '08 w/20k miles. Has everything but nav. After 16k miles/12 months, car feels like development stopped at 85%. All the pieces are there, just not fine-tuned the last 15%. Strong drivetrain performance (2.0t w/5-speed auto), but average gas mileage (mid-20s on highway). Steering is light/fast, but ominous popping/clicking noises from front end when turning at low speed. Smooth road ride is exemplary; rough road ride is jittery/harsh. Seats are comfortable/durable; rest of interior has too much brittle plastic. HVAC/radio too button-intensive. Interior squeaks and rattles are starting. Well-designed conceptually, but execution lacking. Resale value  plummeting even after 3 years."

Drove home 35 miles on the same ice in a car I knew little about. Performed aewsome, never missed a step. Since then my Saab has been the BEST vehicle I hav ever owned. None of the issues others note, great hwy mpg, fast, safe, stylish, reliable, exclusive (see very few SCs on the road), and tracks through snow and ice w/o the need for AWD.

Fun to drive with top up or down, as car handles very well, slicing from lane to lane, and the 2.0T Turbo seems to have more than the 210 hp as hp and torgue is right where you need it, especially 50-70 MPH when passing. Great styling especially with top down which quickly shows its design as a convertible, not a coupe with roof cut off. And excellent value too, with options and features, out the door price makes this a better value than a BMW or Audi. If you are considering these convertibles, do yourself a favor and at least drive the Saab too!"

It has suited me, as well as my growing family, in many environments and situations.  It's handled traffic in Houston, TX, snow/slush in Pittsburgh, PA, and mountainous terrain in Reno, NV.  It has performed well in some huge cross country road trips (sometimes getting 33 mpg).  I love driving in manual-mode (it not only helps with the gas mileage, but it is a bonus when traveling across the Sierra Mountains on a regular basis.  This is a straight-up fun vehicle to drive!

saab,9-3,2006,Mandy, 03/18/2019,Haven't bought my Porsche because of my 2006 Saab,5,"The 2006 Saab Aero Convertible has prevented me from buying the Porsche 911 that I want, and I will tell you why. I used to own a 1998 Porsche 911 993 Convertible and I recked it, fixed it and sold to a German friend which then shipped it back to Germany. It hurt me so much to crash my 911, that you can't imagine the pain. But I deserved it, because I was texting while driving. Do not text and drive. The only car that has been able to for-fill my loss has been the Saab 9-3 2.8L Turbo. I can afford a new Porsche if I wanted too and I put a deposit of $1000 on a 2008 Porsche 911 Turbo AWD Convertible. The Dealer was asking $56,995 and I was and am pre-approved with my credit union with a great interest rate and ready to buy. I got in my Saab 2006 Aero Convertible on my way to see the Porsche that is located in Tampa, Fl and I live in Miami Fl, and got on the highway and I said to myself ""I'm not selling the Saab even if I buy the Porsche"". Then I realized I need to consider the Porsche after I decide to part with the Saab. So, I turned around and called the Dealership and requested my deposit back. The Dealership was awesome and understood my situation. What I'm trying to say is that the car performs almost as good as my 993 911, enough to think about it twice before I give it up. Unless I have a major mechanical issue, the Porsche can wait. I will get the Porsche 911, no doubt. But, there is no hurry! I love my Saab and I will enjoy it until it breaks. (It doesn't break) And I drive it hard.

saab,9-3,2006,Topgun, 01/15/2008,I wish I never bought it,2,"One of the first problems is poor support from the dealership. Within the first few months the leather seat split. Not in a seam but across the leather itself. Dealer couldn't tell the cause so they wouldn't stand by it. Front spoiler is so low you can't turn into a graded driveway without it scraping. I broke mine going through snow. So far the sunroof, Stability Control (ESC)have required repair. The windshield wipers have gone bad twice. To add insult to injury the colored plastic part of the front and rear medallions have come off. Top this off with a paltry 19 MPG and you'll find that IKEA couch you bought was the best thing to come out of Sweden."

Engine coolant light to leaky head gasket to engine replacement.  Unbelievable!!  I love the car other than that.

 What an utter disappointment.
 I know on paper this car is much better than previous models.
Sitting down in the car, my first impression was that I had lost my best friend.
The car has none of the charm that my other SAAB's have had.
It felt like a gussied up cavalier.
None of the materials in the car seemed first rate.
With the current financial problems (and I see why, it doesn't feel like a SAAB SAAB) coupled with the not so nice feel of the car, guess I won't be bringing home the next one.
I drove the new S60 and it felt more like a SAAB than this car."

The ECM has a known defect which causes the ABS, Stability Control, Traction Control, brakes all show as failing, then the speedometer and all other dash components stop working!  Only fix is to pull over and restart!  Talk about dangerous. Saab knows about it and has no fix in sight.  Stay clear of this junky car.

Thank god for my extended warranty.  Multiple electrical issues with stability control failures, and steering wheel lock malfunctions.    Also the plastic inside and emblems outside crack and fall apart.  The car is fun to drive but could be better if it were AWD.  Don't get me wrong BMW, Mercedes, and Audi have their share of problems and cost a lot to fix but at least they aren't going under, and dealerships can still be found.  My car is currently at the shop being fixed again, and once repaired will be going to a dealership to trade on a reliable vehicle"

saab,9-3,2006,MrStrutt, 07/08/2008,Gorgeous but unreliable,4,"I chose the 9-3 convertible from 2006 based on the fact that it was *more* reliable than the 2004 and 2005 models (according to Consumer Reports). However, after barely two months driving it, I have had to take it twice to the dealership -- recent failures include the alternator and the clutch.  I know that Saabs weren't the most reliable cars out there, but I'm still surprised!  The beauty is the 50,000-mile warranty which turns into 1) free repairs and 2) free loaners.  In the end it only costs me trips to the dealership, plus a few parts here and there.  A small price to pay to drive such a beauty!"
saab,9-3,2006,UVAGirl, 07/22/2008,Wish we'd bought Japanese!,3,"We choose the Saab 9-3 Aero over the Audi(we previously had a new A4 with reliability issues), Mercedes, Volvo, and Acura (big mistake). In the past year, we've had to trek to the dealership monthly, weekly, even daily with issues like: radio, emblem falling off, multiple fog light replacements, tires, brake pads, repeated coolant issues, and today the engine started smoking (while driving home from the Saab service dept. after they 'fixed' the engine yet again!) We didn't pay this much for a car to be driving a cheap Ford Focus loaner all the time. To those lucky souls who haven't had reliability issues yet, I say 'wait until your mileage gets a little higher and check back, we're at 50k mi"
saab,9-3,2006,Doobie, 08/11/2008,No sobbing with this Saab,4,"My Chili Red 9-3 2.0T has been a joy to own. With a daily commute of 90 miles round trip, I wanted a car that that drove and handled well without the need for a stiff suspension and low profile tires.  It also had to have good gas mileage, decent acceleration and run on regular gas. This car does it all. One of the most comfortable cars to drive that I have ever owned. The engineers at Saab have geared this car perfectly.  At typical commuting speed, the engine pulls about 2300 RPM.  This is the cars sweet zone. At this speed, the engine is responsive, road feel is fantastic, steady and there are no vibrations or annoying harmonics. No service issues and I am getting 29.5 mpg (hwy).  "
saab,9-3,2006,HK Pearson, 08/20/2008,Frustrating/Disapointing Experience,3,"Bought the car 20 months ago and it has been in the shop 12 times.  Most were warranty items. Replaced the coolant reservoir 4 times and the coolant temp sensor 5 times.  Very disappointed in the car.  Love to drive it, when it is running.  Other warranty items have been stereo cuts in and out, wiring in door loose, replaced the tires 3 times in 37,000 miles, and replaced struts and shocks already.  "
saab,9-3,2006,cubanindesmoines, 11/13/2008,Wanted some fun,4,"Traded an 05 Subaru Legacy-i for the 9- 3. The Saab's seats are very comfortable and there are a lot more features in the Saab.  Acceleration is great and overall very fun to drive.  The vehicle does have unique look to it without being quirky or gimmicky. Hwy mileage has been excellent at 29- 31. City is good at 24 mpg.  Mileage can be worse if you really step into it. I was concerned about overall reliability so I did purchase the service contract with it. Huge amount of features and adjustments for the sound system, climate control, and information systems. Keep the rpm's over 2000 and it runs well. Keep them over 3000 and there is no turbo lag."
saab,9-3,2006,RJR, 11/13/2008,My first Saab and probably my last,4,"I always liked Saab, so I leased this car in 2006 for 27 months.  It's a very nice car for the buck, but I wouldn't buy one.  That's just my personal preference but my sixth sense told me that this car would cost a lot of cash to maintain for the long haul.  Drives great, handles great.  The turbo 2.0L engine is sluggish with the A/C on full blast, but otherwise very quick and great on the highway when you need some extra power.  The exterior is very high quality, interior is the same way.  Not sure why Saab put a completely useless 3""x2.5"" screen on the dash.  It has an integrated phone, but it only works in Sweden, not in the US, so all those buttons are useless unless you live in Sweden. "
saab,9-3,2006,Daddydriver, 12/27/2007,2.0T is the way to go,4,"I have had this car for almost two years so I have good perspective on this car and have had no issues. The turbo charged 4 cylinder offers plenty of power, especially at higher RPMs. Even enthusiasts will enjoy the base 2.0T engine.  For max performance and control, I suggest using the manual shift feature with the automatic transmission. I have really pushed this motor to the max and it is equal to the task. The handling is decent for a front driver. The suspension is a little on the soft side during hard maneuvering but is stable.  The Saab is a great commuting car, but the backseat is small, especially with an infant car seat. "
saab,9-3,2006,Sam, 12/03/2008,Very reliable with great gas mileage,5,"I have had to drive a lot more the last four months with a job change, so I am now putting a lot more mileage on my Saab than I did initially.  Only have 26,000 miles but expect to have 36,000 by next May when the car turns three.  So far, it has been trouble free except for the decal coming off the hood once which was fixed under warranty.  Otherwise, this car gets great gas mileage (29-36 on highway, 18-24 in city - beating EPA estimates of 19 and 29), is completely reliable, and has the acceleration of a new V6 Honda Accord with about 10 mpg better.  No smoking engines, no batteries, no rotors - none of the problems others report.  I guess I live a charmed life."
saab,9-3,2006,tank96, 01/16/2009,Excellence,5,"This is the best car that I can think of. Has styling elements of a BMW without the cost. It can hold its own against V6 competitors while saving gas with a V4. This is my first car that I bought and am very pleased with what I got. I am in college and was still able to pay for it in cash. I have the nicest looking car of anyone I know. Saab is easily the best value car on the market. I can compete with other sports cars and save gas. I got 28MPG when I first started out while driving Very aggressively the whole time. The interior is spacious enough to fit larger people (I'm 6'3"")and is very well designed. Saab does its job making you feel like you're in an airplane cockpit. Comfortable car! "
saab,9-3,2006,Tim, 01/13/2009,So Far So Good,4,"Bought this car almost two months ago.  Too early to know for sure, but so far best car I have owned.  It has snowed every week since I bought it, so I haven't been able to ""joy ride"" much, but the Front Wheel Drive handles snow well.  The interior is my personal favorite.  I liked the interior more than the 3-series and the C-class at the dealer.  The trunk is huge for a little car.  Overall we love it."
saab,9-3,2006,martinj281, 01/29/2009,The funnest car you will ever own!!,5,This car is fun fast and slick. It has great handling tire traction is awesome! This car is great and turbo is a great feature. This would be the best car you will ever own!
saab,9-3,2006,Ryan, 01/15/2009,"Blast to Drive, Blast in the Wallet",4,"This car is a blast to drive.  I bought this car used with about 47,000 miles in 2007.  Because most of the miles were highway, I figured I'd only have a few maintenance issues.  WRONG!  I've easily spent close to 1,500 on this car so far (including the pricy 60K maintenance).  So far the horn and both power windows have broken, along with the temp. gauge.  The front of the car/wheel well is currently squeaking.   Regardless of these issues this car IS A BLAST TO DRIVE! I paid only about 20k for this car and there is no other car at that price point like it.  So, if your looking for a great car to drive and don't mind putting in a little maintenance, this could be the car for you. "
saab,9-3,2006,CP, 02/17/2009,Could be better,4,"It is a great car, but have had problems with steering wheel locking and key not working car at all,this has happened a few times, they said nothing could be done about it .. problem for that year?  Have had electrical quirks, and had to have key reprogrammed. It has speed unreal, can go so fast in seconds. Seats are extremely comfortable, and the gas mileage has been fantastic. It is like the car that keeps giving in the fuel department! The quirks are annoying to say the least for such low mileage, but if I had not had a problem with the above mentioned, the car would rate a 10 in my book hands down."
saab,9-3,2006,M. Coon, 02/23/2009,Without Regret,4,"I was looking for a high class car that wouldn't cost me too much (like BMW).  This car is definitely the right car.  I paid about $14,500 with 37,000 on it... worth every penny too.  The car drives really well and has great pickup because of the turbo. I should also mention that I get 27mpg in the city on a regular basis... really great!"
saab,9-3,2006,NEPA SAAB, 03/18/2009,Update,4,"It's been about 10 months since I submitted a 1 year review so I figured I'd provide some more info. First, my 9- 3 just hit 40k miles. Outside of oil changes the only things I've had to replace is front brakes, tires and headlight bulbs. So in my two years of owning the car I've spent about $800 in repairs. I am extremely thankful for this but I do take very very good care of my Saab. I bought this car out of college after doing a good amount of research. I wanted a nice, sporty car that that offered a little luxury but didn't cost a fortune to buy or repair. The car has delivered in all aspects. If Saab pulls through, I'll buy again. "
saab,9-3,2006,John L, 05/26/2009,Great Value @ 60K Miles 9-3 Aero,4,"Just hit 60,000 miles on the 9-3 Aero after 2.5 years - bought new.  Mostly highway miles in the desert heat.  Just replaced brake pads at 57,000 miles - first time the brakes required any maintenance - be careful - no squealers to alert that your brakes need replacement.  Coolant tank replaced twice.  Only other problem - unable to start - dealer fixed a switch that had ""popped open.""  Car is worth the money and is fun to drive - quick, comfortable and reliable.  Getting 25 mpg on highway and about 22 mpg combined city and highway."
saab,9-3,2006,Saldoman, 01/07/2008,Nice,5,"Overall the Saab 9-3 has delivered as expected with no complaints. The reliability, quality, performance and economy are all where there were advertised to be. I have received as high as 30 mpg on the freeway. I have 15,000 on the car and nothing has failed or needed service. The Saab is just simply fun to drive! All with a very good price on a car that is all it is advertised to be."
saab,9-3,2006,Aero Power, 07/04/2009,Love my Swede Racer!!!,4,"I purchased this car in March 2008 after many months of research.  I wanted something upscale but not the same thing everyone else had (G35, 3- series, A4, etc).  I found myself leaning toward the Swedes so it was down to the 9-3 or the Volvo S40.  I drove the S40 and the turbo lag was scary so I drove the 9-3 and was sold.  The only problems I've had were the coolant reservoir needing to be replaced (under warranty) and my ignition switch failed after a few drops of coffee spilled in it.  The dealership replaced it free as a courtesy but said the next one is my expense ($700).  Everyone loves my car and they say it's perfect for me!  I hope Koenigsegg can help Saab survive!"
saab,9-3,2006,NedSlc, 07/16/2009,"My second Saab, still love them",5,"Got it with 28.000 on it a year ago, has 45.000 now, 0 problems so far (I did replace Death-Cool with Pentosin G12) SID is showing 35 Mpg (50% of my driving is freeway), not as fast as my old 9000 Aero, but I am very happy with the way it drives (took off-ramp with speed limit of 45 at 90 Mph few times). We have some snow in Utah (SLC), and I think it handles as well if not better than my old Subaru Outback with all-season Michelins, guess you have to know how to drive in the snow. It has that 300W sound system, and if adjusted right, sounds better than Bose in my friends 2007 Maxima (he himself said so), so I don't understand all the complaints."
saab,9-3,2006,RogKel, 09/10/2009,77000 Miles and No Problems,4,"Still a quiet, smooth ride.  2.0t has more than adequate power.  Summer mileage 26 to 28 mpg on regular; winter mileage 23 to 25 in NH. No mechanical or electrical problems other than H7 low beam bulbs have a 4-6 month life expectancy. Exterior and interior have held up well.  Highly recommend.   "
saab,9-3,2006,Juice22, 09/23/2009,"Power, Style, and Prestige",4,"I bought this car after looking at BMW, Lexus, and Audi.  We chose the Aero with the Six-Speed manual tranny after testing out the 2.0 automatic, which was great, but a little twitchy in response for me.  The Aero definitely has a better low-end and the manual tranny means I get to control it exactly as I want.   This is by far one of the most enjoyable cars to drive. The Turbo is better than most other cars I've driven. It always turns heads and gets a lot of compliments.  It's nice not seeing so many on the road as well. Just had Coolant reservoir replaced via recall.  Saab service has always been strong and quick to fix any issues...of which I've had very few (replaced stereo amp)."
saab,9-3,2006,victor824, 10/27/2009,1st Time Owner - Not the Last...,4,Nice car!  I was very impressed with the performance and handling.  The interior worked well for me and the power delivered by the 250 hp engine was exhilarating!  The windshield washer reservoir had to be replaced twice - then they came out with the recall.  The back brakes created a tremendous amount of dust compared to the front. ???? Finally replaced the pads with EBC reds - problem solved.  The Saab emblems peeled off after just three years but the dealer replaced them free.  The turbo blew a gasket at 75000 miles and the dealer originally quoted it at $3700 but when I declined they talked to Saab and could get it done for $900.  ????
saab,9-3,2006,Ryan, 10/29/2009,Review after one-year of ownership,4,"I am an aggressive city driver (Washington, DC).  Overall, an amazing improvement from my 1999 9-3 SE, which was a disaster.  The only reason I bought another Saab is because I was deployed with the army for all of 2008 and returned to my hometown (Detroit area) to a completely depressed economy.  Bought this car at 12,000 miles in MINT condition for $16,000 out the door.  A year later at 25,000 miles, it has not let me down.  100K / 6 years from inception bumper-to-bumper.  Failures thus far have been minor.  No warranty claims yet, but will drop off soon for a center console arm rest that slides too freely.  My #1 gripe is the sub-par sound system and iPod input jack. "
saab,9-3,2006,Sold on Saab, 11/09/2009,A Sweet Swede,4,I bought it new and it's still under warranty.  Love the design and utility.  I've driven it across country and back twice in great comfort and safety. Superb handling allowed me to avoid being rear-ended by another driver.  Handled a blizzard in Chicago in February.  Routinely get 33 mpg on freeways using cruise control. Great buy compared to BMW or Audi - thousands less.  HID headlights are the best I've ever seen with.  Real red walnut trim is classy.  Only issue is self-locking doors; they sometimes engage/disengage/engage several times when starting; dealer can't seem to correct this.  Will definitely consider another Saab when I'm ready for another new car.
saab,9-3,2006,michluce, 12/19/2009,Awesome Summer Car,5,"This is a VERY fun car to drive.  I think the exterior style of the 9-3 Aero convertible when the top is down is an absolute beauty.  This car handles very well and the turbo engine kicks in phenomenally.  There is sometimes a slight delay in the automatic, but I have observed that it depends on the temperature outside.  Great car hands down."
saab,9-3,2006,kpdgo, 02/03/2010,Solid car,4,"Excellent car. I don't drive everyday, but when I do drive, I often take trips from 100-200 miles in a day. The car is very comfortable, even after a couple of hours. The mileage is very good on the highway (30+mpg); decent on country roads (22-26mpg); not as good on short trips (20-21mpg).  The sound system is good, but not great by any means. The radio reception is very good, especially by SAAB standards."
saab,9-3,2006,B, 02/01/2010,Long live my SAAB,5,Love the car. Fun to drive. More than enough power that you could ask for. stylish inside and out. Warranty has been great
saab,9-3,2006,Lori, 06/26/2010,LOVE MY CAR,4,"Memorial day this year I hit a deer head on at 65 mph. Grateful no one got hurt, but concerned the airbags didn't go off. I am still waiting for it to be fixed-over $8200 of damage. I miss my car, as it has been fantastic to drive. Never any problems not even in snow. But getting parts for a Saab I find isn't easy. I am told I am #123 in line for the radiator mount, and no clue on how long it takes to fill the back order. Ugh! But hopefully it is before summer is over, as this is why I bought the car. To put the top-down and go for my long drives. This car has been worth every Penny I paid on it."
saab,9-3,2006,2006 Saab 9-3 , 02/05/2008,Disappointed with vehicle,3,"From our purchase date we have been very disappointed with this car.  You would think for the price of the vehicle it would hold up better.  The car constantly has problems.  Problems with the windshield wipers, windshield sprayers, headlights, gas tank cap, doors locking, ingition switch, sunroof, and it rattles.  And the problems re-occur.  We take it to the Saab dealership service department and two weeks later it is back in the shop for the exact same problem.  The front leather seats are very uncomfortable.  There is no support in the seat.  When you are riding in the front you have a tendency to slip forward almost coming off of the seat.  Cheap leather also.  Very disappointed w/car."
saab,9-3,2006,spidaman, 02/05/2008,Fun to drive - pain to service,4,"Fun to drive, but this car has had some significant service issues.  The engine was replaced because coolant was leaking out the tailpipe.  The car went into ""limp home"" mode because of a problem with the transmission.  Both of the above were fixed gratis under the warranty (with loaner Saabs included). Beyond the reliability issues, the car is a dream to drive - fun, responsive and  handles all weather and road conditions with aplomb.  The seats are not as comfortable as past Saabs I have owned, but still a cut above most other cars I have driven."
saab,9-3,2006,mschae, 02/17/2008,Saab FUN,4,"Fun and exciting to drive.  Recently had two rather large rocks hit windshield. However, on further inspection not a mark was noticed.  This car has very rapid pickup in the 70-80 mph range."
saab,9-3,2006,Chris , 02/19/2008,Good car for the price,4,"Overall, I am happy with my Saab 9-3.  The car is fun to drive and comes standard with several whistles and bells that others charge for.  The car is stylish and very fun to drive.  However, I have to agree with others who make mention of constant service.  There is always a rattle or some little piece of cheap plastic that falls off of something.  A total pain.  The electrical has been an issue too (Headlights and power locks).  However, our Saab service department has been great to work with! "

saab,9-3,2006,DetroitKid, 09/22/2005,2006 9-3,4,This vehicle has been great.  It has the ability to accelerate without the feeling that you are being thrown around the car.  The overall comfort of this car is second to none.  
saab,9-3,2006,Texas Blonde, 10/11/2005,Loving my '06 Saab,5,"I got this car about a month ago, and am thrilled with it!  It is a new color for '06 and I am glad I held out for it...  Jet Black Metallic is beautiful!  I feel bad parking next to regular black cars, b/c it makes them look bad...  Very fun to drive, the turbo accelerates well, it is very zippy...  It looks a lot more expensive than it was...  Fuel costs are low, I think I've only filled it up once or twice since I've gotten it...  Great stereo, the leather is a really pretty color and I love having stereo controls on my steering wheel.. "
saab,9-3,2006,Deron, 10/24/2005,First Time Saab Owner,4,"Waited a year for the V6 and so glad I did!!  Power on demand, just press the gas and you are gone.  Exterior styling is very sporty yet classy. Love the look of the Aero so much.  Interior is first rate also.  No cheap materials or cheap looking plastic.  The leather seats are a dream!  Driving is light on the steering, yet you feel the road.  Steering response is quick and provides enough feedback without feeling it.  Love the dash and the layout.  DVD navigation is right on!  Not a harsh ride at all and could actually be a bit tighter I think.  Overall a refined ride, great looks, and excellent feel but has a wolf under the hood!  Test drove a 06 BMW 330 and chose the Saab... 'nuff said!"
saab,9-3,2006,Al B., 12/24/2005,This car makes you unique,4,"I've only had this car for about 2 months and I can't tell you how excited I get when I jump into it every morning.  This is a very fun and sleek ride. It handles the turns well, manuevers with ease and when I want to kick it into overdrive I just switch over to the 5M tiptrometer. Just to tell you how well this car handles, I took it to 115 mph the other day on the hwy, and I literally didn't realize how fast I was going. Its that smooth of a ride.  Yes, people told me to get a BMW 3 or an Acura TL (give me a break; but I tell you what-this car is just as good as those and the cool thing is that I'm the only one I know who owns a Saab! How's that for being cool. "
saab,9-3,2006,John, 01/02/2006,Great entry-luxury,5,"This is a fantastic vehicle. Well-designed, fun to drive and distinctive. I love driving something few others do. Definitely opt for the premium package - well worth the money. And if you live in a cold climate, the heated seats are a must."
saab,9-3,2006,John, 01/06/2006,I love my Saab,5,"Saabs get a bad rap for their interiors.  I love the interior of mine.  In my opinion the scandinavian/cockpit inspired styling beats BMW, Acura, and Audi.  I get a zen like tranquility sitting in it.  The outside styling is great too."
saab,9-3,2006,Ben, 01/07/2006,Saab 9-3 Aero w/ Manual Transmission,4,"If you like to drive slowly, then don't buy this car...  just test drive it and you will understand what I mean.  All my life the cars I have driven have to be at 5000 rpm or higher to enjoy any real power.  This car gives you power at 2000 rpm through 5500 rpm.  It is strong, fast, responsive. I get 28 miles per gallon (with 75% freeway driving and 25% city driving).       If you're looking at the Saab 9-3 Aero, you are probably a very unique person who doesn't like to have what everyone else has, that's why I bought mine."
saab,9-3,2006,Wicklund, 01/20/2006,Anything But a Saab Story,4,"I went in search of a Saab 9-3 based on styling, reliability, and its impeccable safety record.  I thought the car would be nice to drive, but was very surprised at how much fun it really was.  I have to be careful, for it seems to really want to move.  It's comforting to know that I have the responsiveness and acceleration capability from a safety-through-avoidance standpoint."
saab,9-3,2006,zxcvb, 01/21/2006,excellent value,5,Great car. Was skeptical before I leased it for my wife. The acceleration is great. Cannot feel the turbo kick in - unlike my vw and volvo. Driver comfort is excellent. Great for new york city. Can park and accelerate easily.
saab,9-3,2006,Mike M, 02/03/2006,Great Car for the money,5,"I love this car. I drove a 325, a Passat and an A4 and came home with the Saab. It's not quite a 3 series BMW, but for 10K less, comparably equipped, I am very impressed. I love the seats and the Saab center starter. Gets great mileage and has incredible pick-up off the line."
saab,9-3,2006,Jeff, 02/04/2006,I made the right choice,4,"I looked into the Accord EX V6 as well as the Acura TL w/Nav before choosing the 9-3 Aero.  While I am not happy with the navigation system (and did not spend the money for it), the car is an absolute blast to drive, meets or exceeds ALL of my expectations and is everything I wanted.  I got this as a replacement for my RX-8 after having our second child and I was worried I would be disappointed.  Was I wrong!  It corners amazingly, has immediate pickup, is well laid out inside, and comes with a bevy of standard features that you pay extra for in Volvo, BMW, Infinit, and others.  Everyone seems to have an Acura or BMW but FEW have a Saab.  "
saab,9-3,2006,Michelle, 02/26/2006,My 2006 Saab 9-3,4,"When I selected the Saab, I drove a lot of different cars in the 25K-35K price range (Infiniti G35, Volvo S40 & S60, BMW 325, Accord & Solara).  My Saab is great for driving country roads & highways.  I get an average of 26mpg and on the highway I get up to 32mgp.  Great acceleration when passing other cars.  You feel like your only doing 70, but when you look at to speedometer you realize that your cruising at 110, oops!  I find the 9-3 to be very comfortable. But my boyfriend, who is 6'2 finds that there is not enough legroom widthwise across the car.  When driving his right leg rests against the console.  The only problem I have had is that you really need to slam the doors to shut them."
saab,9-3,2006,Marvin Young, 03/26/2006,Saab Convertible - Performance and Fun,5,The Saab 93 Convertible is incredible! I own the Aero and the new 2.8 V6 turbo is worth the extra cash.

Car enthusiasts and mags are negative on front wheel drive, BUT I live in the northeast, their is virtually no torque steer and I am much more likely to drive in inclimate weather than take a turn at 90 mph.  The car is distinctive and a blast to drive.  "
saab,9-3,2006,Lovin it, 05/05/2006,Great So far,4,"Got this car about a month ago and I can say I am very satisifed so far. It is a little smaller than what I am used to but the gas mileage improvement is more than worth it in this $3/gallon gas world. The performance is awesome for a wagon, the stereo sounds great and it is pretty luxurious inside. I liked the Aero better but it wasn't worth the extra dollars. It feels great on the highway and the only turbo lag I have found is in first gear. If you keep the RPMs high enough, you will never notice."

Awesome car we where looking at the Volvo S60, MB C230, Audi A4, and BMW 330i... But no one could beat the price even with all the optional features tacked on. I could not pass that up, great car, nice ride semi road noise when the moonroof is up in freeway. My wife loves all the buttons, dual control climate control w/ filter, dual power seats, roomy back seats, and cooled glove box. They have really got a winner here now all they have to do is redefine the 9-5... "
saab,9-3,2006,seal8485, 05/24/2006,Gotta get a Saab,4,"Overall, I have been very impressed with this car.  The start off the line is a little slow, but once that turbo get's going you really feel the punch.  It handles like it's on rails (name the movie).  For the semi-compact size of this vehicle it is still really roomy on the inside.  I used to drive an SUV and the gas was just killing me so I decided to get this instead."
saab,9-3,2006,BF, 06/29/2006,Enjoying the car,4,"I have the black Sport Combi, and everyone agrees - it looks sharp!  The upward rake makes it look very sporty and unique from other wagons.  Tne leather interior is beautiful, and the car feels solid.  The Turbo 2.0 provides a lot of power to a 4-cylinder engine - more than my previous V6 car."
saab,9-3,2006,Mike, 07/01/2006,"Better than the reviews by CR, Edmunds",5,"A very understated car.  It almost looks like a combination of the positive characteristics of bmw and volvo, along with Saabs traditional design. Handles well, I like the fact it takes REGULAR GAS!   You can't get that on any other european car.  But I believe my mileage is more like 20-22 city  25hwy.   The interior could be a bit larger, stereo and controls could use a little work.  Moving flexible armrest on the center consule can be annoying.  I think that the reports about the reliability being poor are not fair.  Look at mercedes, bmw, volvo, volkswagen, audi, they are all about the same or worse.  I previously had a 900 which ran over 165K, with no major concerns.  These are good cars"
saab,9-3,2006,aero_joe, 07/05/2006,Better Value,4,"This is my first Saab after owning 2 Audi A4s. I've always loved the exterior styling of Saabs but never thought about owning one until this year when my lease on my last Audi was nearly complete.  I looked at both Audis and BMWs but chose the Saab because it provided me the power, performance, styling and comfort for a lot less than the comparable Audi and BMW models. The real factor was the new 2.8 turbo V6 engine which gives this car the performance equal to the much more expensive 330i and the 3.2 A4."
saab,9-3,2006,Santanu, 07/10/2006,Incredible sedan !,4,"I tend to buy cars that are uncommon, Saab was a natural choice, knowing their history also made me curious. When I test drove a Saab 9-3, I couldn't believe people haven't ""found"" this car yet. Saab 9-3 is the most ergonomically designed car around. Extremely well designed car, so beautiful and stylish outside and inside... my friends (having M3, 5 series, Merc etc) were wanting to get rides in it for a month! You will feel the difference the moment you sit in the driver's seat. You feel euphoria when ""turbo"" kicks in. Incredible dash, controls, cool features and very comfortable seats. Huge trunk and glovebox. Officially safest (not Volvo) vehicle on road today... sidebags galore. Just love it."
saab,9-3,2006,S.C., 07/13/2006,Much better than I expected!,4,"This is a great car for the money. My last lease was an A4 quattro, nice car too but much to expensive when you can get a 9-3 for $4000. less.  I really enjoy the Saab dash and display format. The 2.0t is an awsome engine with hardly any turbo lag. The exterior looks great and I love the new iPod hook-up feature (smart move). All in all you won't go wrong with Saab. "
saab,9-3,2006,MJM, 07/21/2006,Great car... BUT,4,"Have had this car about 4 months and have been mostly pleased.  Great mileage... about 35 hwy.  Good power, nimble handling and comfortable ride/seating.  Controls required me reading the book for an hour to fully figure them out.  Easy access for  the 2 car seats and ample cargo area.  We are struck though by minor complaints re:cup holders.  2 separate and peculiar locations, when it appears only some small engineering changes could 've made these much more user friendly.  Limited console storage area as well.  Overall a great car w/a few minor convenience issues."
saab,9-3,2006,IL Owner, 07/24/2006,High Value Alternative,4,"Recently bought the car, with just a couple hundred miles in, I really like it.  Low torque steer, good cornering stability, quiet ride, and decent economy."
saab,9-3,2006,Colorado Saab Owner, 08/09/2006,"Great value, excellent performance.",4,"I had no intention of owning a Saab until I stopped to take a look at a 9-3 Sportcombi at a local dealership.  I have owned Volvos for over thirty years, but never a Saab.  The 9-3 Sportcombi comes in at about $10,000 less than a Volvo XC 70 wagon.  Yes, the Saab has less room and is slightly smaller, but it also gets significantly better mileage and is noticeably more nimble.  This car is a real sleeper -- when you look at what you get for the money it's pretty hard to beat.  I'm thinking of getting a second one to replace my Ford van.  Also, there is virtually no turbo lag, and a lot of get up and go when you need it.  Mileage is outstanding for a car of its size."
saab,9-3,2006,SH, 08/08/2006,Understated and underappreciated fun car,5,"We started with every foreign-built sedan under $30K and test-drove nearly all 13 on our short-list. Wanted something more unique than what we see all over the roads. My wife and I left the 9-3 test drive with the first smiles on our faces. A refined ride as the TSX with added turbo boost and comfortable seats. Just had my first service - at 10,000 miles - and love everything about the car."
saab,9-3,2006,Kerri, 08/09/2006,Love it!!!,4,"Absolutely love my 9-3 Aero!  It's fun to drive, has a lot of power and love the look!"
saab,9-3,2006,Scott, 08/18/2006,"Fun car, but needs a little arm room",4,"Love the gas mileage!  Love the acceleration, and optional manual shifting on the fly.  I do wish there was more room or padding on the door where your elbow naturally sits during a long drive.  My arms get sore after an hour of driving from having to place to comfortably rest. I also miss my auto-dimming mirrors from my previous vehicle. Otherwise the seats are very comfortable and the position of the headrest is the best I have ever found.  My wife calls it ""the fast car"" and tries to steal it whenever she can."
saab,9-3,2006,mjbcl1, 08/24/2006,Very Impressed!,5,"Never having owned a Saab before, I was a little apprehensive at first.  That is, until I got behind the wheel!  the performance is captivating and the drive is a whole lot quieter than expected (via other reviews on other websites). Fuel economy is fair to well in city driving and terrific on hwy.  I love the interior gadgets and ability to connect my iPod.  We've had it for over a month now and I continue to be impressed with every aspect of this vehicle.  Sound system is terrific and the power moonroof is an absolute MUST!  "
saab,9-3,2006,Kristina, 10/20/2005,Luxury that Stands Alone,5,"I recently purchased a Saab Linear 9-3 and I can't say enough good things about it.  I test drove and Audi A-4, a BMW 3-Series and was on my way to test drive a Lexus IS300 when I decided to stop and test drive a Saab.  Needless to say, I didn't even bother going to the Lexus dealership, and bought the Saab the next day.  Having just graduated college, I wanted a luxury car that was sporty and well-designed, but I didn't want to be looking at a mirror image every time I was stopped at a stop light.  That is exactly what I got and I couldn't be more excited every time I get in the driver's seat.  "
saab,9-3,2006,1saabowner, 11/14/2005,"Great car, but no Acura",3,"I currently own a 2005 Acura TL 5AT with navigation.  My wife traded in her 2001 Lexus ES for the 9-3 Aero with everything, for about the same price as my TL.  I really like the seats on the 9-3, which are slightly more comfortable than my TL.  However, we weren't impressed by all the hard, black plastic throughout the interior, especially when compared with the TL.  Acceleration is good throughout the RPM range, but the normally aspirated TL is better.  The Saab does shine in safety, with a BEST PICK side rating (1 notch above TL) and GOOD rear impact rating.  Not a bad choice, but we like our TL a lot more."
saab,9-3,2006,Chris, 11/24/2005,Great Car,5,"i ws not planning to buy a car.  Drove it while my VW was in service, and had to get it.  Never thought I would have a Saab.  Drove the 325i, A4, and C230 Sport and bought this.  Maybe not quite a 325, but a lot of car for the price.  Handles good, and is fun to drive.  Car has great gas mileage for the ""funness"" of it.  Better than the 2004 Passat I traded in."
saab,9-3,2006,Susan, 12/06/2005,The best car!,5,"I was looking at another cadillac when I saw the Saab.  I was attracted to the looks and when I drove it, it was so smooth that I changed my mind in the middle of the deal to the Saab.  I absolutely love everything about this car and will buy another one in the future!"
saab,9-3,2006,John M, 12/21/2005,SAAB most underated car,5,"This is an excellent car.  Great build quality, styling, handling and performance.  very underated car. This car is a blast to drive  If anyone is thinking of an Asian import you need to test drive this vehicle."
saab,9-3,2006,erich, 01/14/2006,almost perfect,4,Saab really did a good job with this car.  The V6 makes all the difference.  Thank god those 4 cylinders are gone.   The car has incredible passing power.  Acceleration is smooth through the entire power band.   I also found it to be a MUCH better value than a comperably equipped Audi or BMW.  I feel like I saved thousands.  The base Aero has almost everything you'd want on it so you don't get dinged for options that should be standard. 
saab,9-3,2006,Paul Hughes, 02/16/2006,Saab's best car yet?,4,"This is my fourth Saab and my favorite.  V6 is smooth and torquey, manual transmission light and easy to use. (Kudos to GM on the engine!)  And best handling FWD car I've driven in a long time.  Saab needs to upgrade the stereo. it is weak for 300W.  Super supportive and comfortable seats, and a more unique convertible choice for So. California, which I like.  I highly recommend this car."
saab,9-3,2006,mark, 03/02/2006,aggressive drivers beware,5,"Got the car for 28k with the automatic. Car is by far the best thing going for the price. This car will get you speeding tickets for sure. I got one the second day. reaxxs rear steering is amazing when you push the car to its limits through corners.ESP actually works great keeping you out of the ditch. Brakes are incredible, zero fade. Car cruises at 130 getting 24mpg but gets a little loose over 140, the aero ground effects would probably take of this. stereo cranks as long as you're not into heavy bass, 6 disc changer is nice. Definitely worth considering. we chose this over the subaru wrx due to styling and driving comfort. I drive all over the continent and enjoy every bit of it"
saab,9-3,2006,Socker, 03/05/2006,Great choice,5,"Was looking at BMW 3-series when I came across the new 9-3 aero...so glad I did!  Amazing car to drive...so smooth and quiet on the road, with plenty of space inside for hauling people and things.  I've always had a liking of ""unique"" cars, and the Saab 9-3 is definitely a unique car.  It's all the luxury and performance of a BMW or Audi, at a slightly lower price, and you can bet you won't see another one at every stop light!"
saab,9-3,2006,gp, 03/22/2006,One of the best looking vertables,4,"Went from an 04 Audi S4 to this car, and although I miss the kick off the line, I realize I went with this car for a totally differant mindset. The car does have good passing power, but the turbo doesn't kick in right off the line. Steering wheel feels like a GM. Little loose, but can get used to it. Quick quiet drop top. beautiful dash with green night lights. 2 semi useful cupholders.   "
saab,9-3,2006,Raven777, 04/04/2006,2006 Saab 9-3 Aero Convert. Fun!!!,4,"I was leery at first buying a Saab since many of my friends had warned me that Saabs had many problems.  Well so far at ~3k miles they have been wrong.  I love this car, it is fun to drive, very fast, and it turns heads.  Even BMW drivers look to see, what is that car.  The seats are the best ever!  The confort is superb.  The interior is nicely done with two-tone seats.  The stereo though leaves something much to be desired. A Bose system would make a huge improvement.  For this class car to not have BlueTooth is a shame, ONStar or not."
saab,9-3,2006,mainecliffdweller, 04/14/2006,mmmmmmm,5,"Just took delivery three weeks ago and have already put 3000k on my new Saab 9- 3 sport combi.  With two 100lb dogs and me over 6'6"" I was worried that the wagon wouldn't be big enough, but it fits me like a glove!  There is certainly enough room and it is so much more fun to drive than an SUV.  I'm a big back road driver and this car is perfect for that.  Love it!"
saab,9-3,2006,JD, 04/16/2006,More Bang for Your Buck,4,"My wife and I drive a BMW 325Ci an Audi A4 Quattro and recently leased a 2006 Saab 9-3 Aero (manual). This car is awesome, easily the best of the bunch and the others are pretty good. The Saab offers better performance, more interior comfort and space and respectable gas mileage (28.5 mpg on a recent highway trip). The best features of the car are the V-6 engine and the upgraded seats that the Aero model offers. The engineers who put the engine together have created one of the most useable and powerful engines I have ever driven. In particular on two lane highways you can pass quickly and in confidence. "
saab,9-3,2006,Kuribo, 04/28/2006,Better than the A4!,4,"Just picked up a 2006 9-3 Sport Sedan with Automatic and Cold Weather package. Coming off lease on a 2003 Audi A4.  We've only had the Saab for a few days but it's really wonderful. Side by side, the performance is  better than the A4 1.8T.  Smoother shifts, more refined engine and much faster. Interior is really nice and different than German & Japanese cars. The mpg is also quite a bit better than the Audi.  Priced the 2006 Saab 9-3 against a 2006 Audi A4 2.0 front driver: the Audi ended up $9000 more. Not worth it!  Our first Saab and I think it's a great, under appreciated car"
saab,9-3,2006,Kuribo, 05/03/2006,Great Value,4,"Just purchsed a 2006 9-3 Sport Sedan for my wife. The 9-3 Sport Sedan  is very well equipped so we just added Cold Weather package and Sentronic Automatic Transmission. It is much quicker than the old 1.8 Audi and the engine has a nicer character and better gas mileage. A really beautiful, under appreciated car. "
saab,9-3,2006,Brannen, 05/02/2006,My fifth saab,4,"Fast for a Saab new 6 speed auto is great.  New duel exhaust sounds good.   Need to see 1/4 mile time for this car with normal test temps not in the middle of a desert like Car and Driver tested this car two mo ago and gave a very poor review.   This is my 5th Saab and my third Aero.  Drive it and you will buy it!  When the dealer delivers the car, do not use harsh wheel cleaner on Wheels as this discolors the break calipers. D "
saab,9-3,2006,Matt Severson, 06/09/2006,06 SportsCombi,4,"What a fun car to drive.  Expecting our first baby and wanted safety first and foremost in a wagon.  Tired of SUV.  Considered the Volvo V70 and XC70 but didn't have the same ""fun"" quotient.  We had a Saab 9-3 convertible before and had always been impressed by it's torque at low RPMs.  The 9-3 Sports Combi did not disappoint.  We were hooked after the first drive.  The redesign suspension makes handling superb.  I love that it has full complement of airbags including curtain airbags.  Gets good gas mileage, is fun and unique to drive.  Would like to have gotten the 9-5 but it's in desperate need of a redesign.  "
saab,9-3,2006,dcoggins, 06/08/2006,2006 Saab 9-3,4,"This is my third Saab and it is absolutely a wonderful driving experience.  Coming from a former Indy race car fan, I'm vividly reminded of the race... the engine sound & speed of the cars.  It has that certain sound reminiscent of that great noise. It feels lots more powerful than my other 9-3's due to turn-on-a-dime cornering, hold on the road fast speed, the inside quiet, speakers (woofer in the trunk).  I had to watch my speed with the prior car.  Now I absolutely have to watch it.  So fast so quickly!!!  I love it the best of the other Saabs.  My only wish is to have this performance placed inside a smaller but the remarkable Saab body style of the 80's. That was THE CAR!!! "
saab,9-3,2006,pixie777, 06/13/2006,Very pleased with purchase,5,"I've only had my Saab 9-3 for a week but I absolutely love it! I think that people are negative about Saabs because not very many people own them. It comes equipped with many standard features that you pay handsomely for with the BMW 325i - which I test drove also. It's comfortable, the drive is very smooth and I love the exterior design of it. I was looking for a compact sedan with that special ""something."" My friends and family love it. If you are considering a Saab, please test drive one. You will not be disappointed!"
saab,9-3,2006,Daid Hecht, 06/14/2006,"So far, so good!",4,"I've put 6000 miles on the Sport Combi, and it has been bulletproof so far.  Have averaged 28.0 mpg on the computer on regular gas.  Car has plenty of power, is very comfortable and looks great, because it is different.  Every passenger so far has been complimentary, and at least one friend just purchased one because he liked it so much.  "
saab,9-3,2006,?, 06/25/2006,Fantastic Drive!!!,4,"After attending the Aero Academy, I realized this car has excellent handling and is built for fun driving AND safety. It's got a sporty ride & a nice interior. It was obviously built with comfort in mind & attention to detail. It's my first Saab, & I will never buy another type of car if I can help it. Go to the Aero Academy if you can! It's the most fun I've had in I don't know how long! I love my Saab!!!"
saab,9-3,2006,saabguy, 06/24/2006,Great sport sedan,5,I love this car. It handles great and has plenty of power for passing carving up twisty back roads. This Saab is very comfy and feels solid when driving. It doesn't hurt that this car is one of the safest cars on the road. 
saab,9-3,2006,Dave Hecht, 06/26/2006,It's been great!,5,"After 6,000 miles, the car has been absolutely perfect.  Nothing has gone wrong.  It has averaged 28.1 MPG with only one long trip.  It handles well and is very distinctive... gets lots of looks at stop lights.  It is more comfortable than I would have expected and rides much better than I though.  My last car was a 2002 BMW 525i so that was a tough car to follow.  It is my 3rd Saab in the last 20 years... the best of the bunch."
saab,9-3,2006,Ozzysmom, 06/29/2006,Just love it!,4,"I've owned my Saab for almost three weeks and man do I love this car.  It's gorgeous.  I got the steel grey metallic.  Love the two tail pipes. It's smooth, very easy to drive, very fast.  You will feel the bumps, but it's a sportscar afterall.  Love the rear parking assist.  I like the dash, but feel like they could have offered the chrome detail on the dash.  Love the steering wheel design.  Hate the passenger side view mirror.  It's hard to see out of it.  The front-end is VERY low.  I have already knocked the front fender out, but because it's a Saab, it's incredibly durable and the dealer was able to pop it back in like 30 seconds.  Overall, it's stylish, fun to drive, and reliable."
saab,9-3,2006,saabfan, 07/30/2006,Awesome car,4,"Only three weeks with the car, but loving every minute. Once you take this car home, you'll think of any excuse to take it out for a drive. "
saab,9-3,2006,cervids, 08/12/2006,2006 93 Aero Review,4,"Former BMW and Audi driver. The 93 Aero is powerful; 250bhp/258lb-ft available for real life driving conditions through most of the power band not just near the redline. 90% percent of maximum torque is achieved at 1,500 rpm! Not enough power, buy a simple plugin engine control PPC upgrade ($850) which enables 285bhp/358lb-ft. The rock solid suspension and superb road manners allow you apply that awesome power as if gliding rails in addition to the legendary Saab safety, utility, spaciousness, and functionality. The interior is abundantly quite, however, the car is tuned to provide the enthusiast with an addictive amount of engine and turbo sound."
saab,9-3,2006,TennisMan, 08/13/2006,Great car for money,4,"Great car to drive, powerful 4-cylinder engine, nice fit and finish, terrible audio system.  We leased our 2.0T automatic for 2 years and so far it is great fun to drive.  Wish it had memory seats standard, though.  Stereo is crap, with poor sound quality and aggravating RDS scrolling which is hard to fix.  Gets about 30 mpg on hwy, 21 around town.  Auto-stick works well with the 4-cylinder turbo.  A little tight in the rear seat quarters for adults."
saab,9-3,2006,Joe Scibetta, 08/25/2006,Polar Bear White,5,I love this car.  It is agile and nimble on the road.  It looks different from the other coupes on the road.  I am so happy with it that I have already forgotten about my Mercedes-Benz.  I feel you get a very versatile and SAFE vehicle for the dollar.
saab,9-3,2006,oomps, 08/16/2006,Great when not in the shop...,4,"I purchased this car on 07/18/06.  Up to now (08/15/06), the car has been to the shop 4 times for a/c problems.  This car has NOT been reliable and has turned me off from the brand.  The few times I've had it, it has been fun to drive.  It's a great little luxury/sport sedan.  It drives rather well and is fast once you are above 2000 rpm.  Tire noise is audible.  The 300 watt system needs improvement.  Seats are great and all the controls are with in reach. Fuel economy has been pretty good with about 22-24 mpg."
saab,9-3,2006,brandedsaab, 08/27/2006,Sixth Saab - best ever,4,"Great car and so much fun to drive - comfortable, fast.  Engine purrs.  Top goes down and up quick.  Just under 2K miles - no problems at all. 22.4 mpg - and not broken in yet, and city driving. "
saab,9-3,2006,SAAB OWNER, 08/27/2006,GREAT CAR,4,"I got this car about 2 weeks ago, and it's great. The Saab is very affordable considering all the standard options that are equipped standard.  It's  fun to drive and very nimble which surprised me being that it has only a 2 liter engine.  The European styling cues make it interesting and unlike any other car on the road.  Also, the Pirelli tires that come standard are an excellent feature meshing well with the cars responsive rack and pinion steareing system.  Great car yet would like to see more contoured seats particularly in the lower back area.  "
saab,9-3,2006,J, 09/20/2006,"Excellent value, fun to drive sport/lux",5,I love how this car drives.  Very sporty and fun yet not hash.  2.0T has good power even with automatic.  Excellent styling!
saab,9-3,2006,jcp, 09/23/2006,Love my car!,5,Great car. Fun to drive. Good mileage compared to similar luxury sedans. Leather seats are firm and comfortable. 
saab,9-3,2006,Frank, 09/24/2006,Much improved 2006,3,"We had a 2003 9-3 sedan. This 2006 model feels more rigid and the steering feels tighter, which  makes it more fun to drive. Suspension is a bit smoother but still is firm. Overall a lot better car than our 2003. If you want a good looking and fun car to drive, the Saab Sportcombi may be what you're looking for! "
saab,9-3,2006,UH2L, 12/20/2006,Great alternative to many SUVs,4,"I've owned the 2.0 T manual trans., my 3rd Saab, about a year.  It has been almost perfect.  Some latches have needed lubrication, but no other issues.  I've averaged 28 mpg with about 40% highway miles.  Sound system is more than sufficient, the car feels stable at speed with a great compromise for ride and handling.  Even if you don't like this car, it's worth buying just for the safety and efficiency!  You don't need a Subaru; they're not efficient because of the 4WD and unless you drive in really bad conditions, all you need is the stability control that the Saab has standard.  Controls can be a little confusing but seats are amazing.  This car is a steal and holds lots of stuff.  "
saab,9-3,2006,divyesh, 12/24/2006,Worth considering strongly,4,"I purchased this car last year.  I have been searching for a small sporty sedan for a while.  This has been as close to perfect a choice for me as I have found to date.  I traded in a VW Passat for this and don't regret it yet.  This car is worth a serious look.  There have been no major problems so far at 15,000 miles.  Minor problems include: a 6 disc cd changer that jammed and had to be replaced, many of the parchment interior body panels were slightly discolored on delivery, and there are a few rattles predominantly in the door panels (a bit disappointing for a $30,000 car).  "
saab,9-3,2006,Metodi, 12/31/2006,Best car i've ever owned!,5,"This Saab is incredible! Enormous fun to drive, very comfortable, very beautiful car.  The Swedes definitely put their heart into this particular design.  No problems yet with drivetrain, engine is strong and the turbo sure adds to the fun, step on it and you may not know you're doing 100 already!  We lived in Germany for 9 months - our Saab is Autobahn tested and believe me, it's passed every test, up to 235 km/h.  The aerodynamics of the car are hardly matched by any other auto maker, it's quiet and it's very steady!  I would buy this car 10 times over!"
saab,9-3,2006,BikeFit, 01/01/2007,SportCombi - More than a Sedan / Minivan,5,"We have just crossed the 500 mile mark and the car has performed great. Out on the highway the car does well for a midsize car (e.g. semi trucks that went flying by us didn't move our car as much as our minivan) and around town the car is a blast to drive.  The safety features are second to none and car has many luxury features with impressive build quality - no rattles.  Back seat comfort and cargo area exceeds the rest of the cars we looked at (Volvo, Audi, Honda) and meets our needs as well as the minivan does during arond town drives. The controls and radio are simple and easy to use.  Speed warning feature is very nice and provides another safety feature (i.e. no speeding tickets)."
saab,9-3,2006,Jared, 01/10/2007,"Value Priced, Modest Design",4,"Overall, I have been very happy with my 2006 Saab 9-3. Coming from a late model BMW, the differences were dramatic in ride, handling, computer interface and interior design. I have been more than satisfied in all areas. My primary concern with the car is the road noise inside of the cab, however; putting everything that could be a concern into perspective, road noise is really not a big deal. "
saab,9-3,2006,Philip Reid, 01/16/2007,GREAT SportCombi,4,"Saab is getting closer and closer to hitting it on the nose with style, performance and comfort.  This SportCombi is nothing short of fantastic - driving and comfort.  They still need to work out the cheap plastic dash interior but I hear they made huge strides in the 2007 model.  If you are in the market for a nice European car with lots of cargo space, don't skip looking at the Saabs -  you'll not regret it."
saab,9-3,2006,JL, 01/20/2007,Wonderful car,4,"This is a lovely car to drive.  The performance, ride, handling, versatility, and comfort are all top notch.  I have the automatic transmission which is the best I have ever driven.  Fuel economy is very good for the power and size of the car.  The radio is a bit confusing and has way more features than I need.  It can be extensively customized but it takes a lot of patience and help from the manual to figure it all out.  The front seats are very comfortable, the rear seat is also nice, but a little too low for tall people.  The hatch takes tons of cargo, the look of the car is lovely.  Especially with the incentives Saab offers, this care is an incredible value!"
saab,9-3,2006,DH, 02/08/2007,Good Choice,4,"Extremely pleased so far - handling, styling, and power meet my high expectations from Saab.  Enjoy setting the automatic controls so the radio & heat come on the way I want them to.  Love the ""heads-up"" display atop the dash, but why do I still have a big screen in the middle of the dash with nothing to display?  The basic audio system is a bit bland -  I'm sure there's a subwoofer in there someplace, but my ears haven't found it.  The engine has nice perky pickup, although the delay while the turbo kicks in was odd at first.  Still, I find myself doing 80 without realizing it."
saab,9-3,2006,Peter, 02/03/2007,"Saab convertable, 2006",4,"Great car.  Not one problem to report.  Car is quick, agile, comfortable, great features.  I've added Sirius radio and GPS.  Also, snow tires.  I looked at a lot of cars, many convertibles.  It came down to the Saab and Mazda6 (not a convertible).  Both great cars, but I'm very glad I went with Saab."
saab,9-3,2006,lance20, 02/14/2007,Great GM Car So Far,5,"I'm just about to turn 3,000 miles in my 06 Aero and so far, so good.  I come from a GM family and have previously owned two Chevy S-10 Blazers.  So, the switch to a Saab has been pretty radical.  I first noticed the car on the road and thought it was beautiful before finding out it was a GM product.  The 06 model is still very Saab oriented whereas the 07 model is adopting more of the GM DNA on the interior.  Overall I have been very happy with the looks, performance and value of this vehicle.  I very rarely see any other Aero models on the road... mostly 2.0s.  If you are lookng for an affordable entry-level luxury sports sedan, the 9-3 is tough to beat."
saab,9-3,2006,TRT, 04/17/2007,Two Years and Still Love It!,4,"I am just now adding my review after two years into my three year lease and I still love this car. I find the car to be a great performer and very comfortable. I tested the BMW 3 series, the Audi A4 and the Infiniti G35 and have never had a second thought about my decision. A couple of minor things (mostly electronics related) have caused the car to go into service but with the warranty and free scheduled service it has been an easy car to live with. I find the car to be quite handsome in the euro way and is unique on the road. Many friends who own BMW 3 series comment how they get tired of seeing themselves at every street corner. A solid buy/lease. "
saab,9-3,2006,AERO PLEASURE, 04/22/2007,Aero Pleasure,4,"I compared many cars before ultimately deciding on the 9-3 Aero V6.  It would have cost me $5,000 more to buy a comparable car from another manufacturer.  I was extremely pleased with the overall value I achieved, having purchased every available option and not breaking the $40K barrier. I have to say, the audio quality of the 300 watt stereo is disappointing & the navigation system is extremely poor!  The navigation unit in a Honda Civic is far better! I understand that both the stereo and the navigation have been improved and this makes me wish I had waited to buy the 2007 model.  I had a problem with the coolant system and after 6 service trips, I think it has finally been fixed!"
saab,9-3,2006,allyson, 07/21/2007,Saab 2006 2.0T,4,I love the car. It is nice and quiet when the windows are closed.  Compact but not too compact. I also like the huge amount of trunk space.  I like how the car responds and it is so easy to drive.

It has these tiny features to be grateful for, like a rear fog light, a glove box to keep items cold, the manual buttons on the steering wheel, and the pockets for storage on the front seats, along with many others!! The back leaves little space when the driver and passenger need more room in the front. Overall, would never go back to a BMW! GM please don't change any body styling, it's perfect as it is, thank you for a great car!!"
saab,9-3,2006,NJ Bald, 10/22/2007,"Exceeds expectations, ""expert"" opinions",5,"At 16,000 miles and 18 months, the car has been trouble free and all maintentance has been covered for free (one oil change).  This car is more reliable than the Toyota and Honda I previously owned.  Car handles very well, and although the controls are a little complicated, figured out how to use the car after a couple of days of ownership.  This has become my favorite car and willing to replace with a new one in 10 years when this one needs replacing."
saab,9-3,2006,Paul Guinnessy, 03/25/2008,Well rounded tourer,4,"The 9-3 sportcombi is an excellent tourer that keeps the driver well connected to the road without fatigue. The seats are great, the safety features are best in class, and the car is nimble in traffic. Currently averaging 26 mpg in city/highway driving. The interior could be improved, which apparently happened with the later versions of the car. The car also feels more balanced that the sedan version, because of the better weight ratio (52/48 instead of 60/40 in the sedan). This has an impact on the feel of the car and how the suspension performs. The reliability has been rock solid since we leased it. Its very likely we will keep the car when the lease is up. "
saab,9-3,2006,tennisman, 05/14/2008,9-3: a noisy ride,4,"Won't be buying another Saab; after living with the excessive road noise and poor stereo for 2.5 years, it's time to get a quieter car.  Wears me out on a long road trip.  Awful stereo, with no bass in the back parcel shelf.  All bass is in the doors, which makes everything rattle that is in the door pockets."
saab,9-3,2006,Taigen, 06/25/2020,Great vehicle for under $5000,5,"The cons: Expensive repairs (In Washington state)
The electrical can behave erratically.
It's older and some luxuries are oddly modern and others are oddly outdated.

The pros: It's affordable
It's dependable
It's speedy, safe, all-around, and excels at everything you'd expect for a 2006 vehicle.

Real, if you take care of your car it will take care of you. This vehicle needs a bit of TLC. Read the manual, use the correct fluids, get your vehicle serviced correctly... Do the things you need to do to an older vehicle and its a great vehicle. If you can't work on vehicles yourself in the slightest, don't buy a foreign car.

This Saab is great. I love it."
saab,9-3,2006,Zena, 08/19/2020,Can be a hassle,2,"I bought my 06 Saab 9-3 2.0T in 2014. It drives really well in city and highway. Over about 85 mph you can almost feel the car wanting to go faster. It lasted me through countless moves, one of which was a 2500 mile drive, and does well in all weather conditions. I did have a lot of consistent problems. The car would once per year (minimum) lock my steering saying there was a problem with it, but no problem ever arose. The ultimate test of ""did you turn it off and on again"" would work every time this would happen. I would disconnect my battery for a few minutes and when reconnected the problem went away! I even got it checked but no problems. I did also have many weird electrical failures like doors not unlocking or locking, not being able to use the CD player if it was cold outside, and the glove box light staying on even when closed. The main headache with this car is that hardly anyone would work on it. Even some imported car mechanics turned me away. There is a website to look up Certified Saab places to work on these cars but none were close to me so I would have to drive unnecessary distances to get my car fixed up even though I lived in a large city. I did need to replace the key once, a $275 cost. I will not buy another Saab again despite all of the pros!

My only complaint is the broken fuel gauge issue that makes me track mileage on the odometer between fillups. It handles very well and the suspension is smooth.

When you have a car as well-rounded as this, people often dig around for any little excuse to put her down. For instance, I see people bashing the interior or claiming that the handling isn't good enough. That's a load. This car's interior is fantastic. It is practical, minimal, and elegant in true Swedish style. 

Saab was an uncompromising company with high standards and a progressive attitude. They simply didn't fit the mold of consumer sameness and that may have been their downfall. They made safe, fast cars with idiosyncratic personalities. They will be missed. "

It is light-weight, easy to open, arches back at the top so I don't bang my head. I'm 6'1"" and I rejected several others due to a lack of head/shoulder room. The SportCombi has plenty. How about that cooled glove box? Neat! It is a reasonable and rational choice for my lifestyle and I am very glad I selected this car. It looks as good parked at the library as the sports stadium.  This is the right automobile for my lifestyle."

Over the span of 6 years, had to replace 1 crank shift sensor 300$, 1 power window 300$, and a brake line 200$; rotors with brakes with run 500$ for a pair.
One dealership tried to con me out of a radiator for another 1K, so careful where you take it.

It's distinctively beautiful inside and out, with a very attractive interior and style that I find far superior to the German cars. The handling is exceptional for so heavy a car, and the ride is very pleasantevidence of a supple suspension setup. The more I drive it, the more I respect the work of Saab engineers and designers. Even the colors of my car, silver with parchment leather, are stunning: people comment so favorably. I feel so happy to drive this Saab!"

It has an automatic transmission with manual mode. A few days after purchase at a local GM dealer the wind deflector (plastic cover under the front of the car) disintegrated taking out right fender cover with it on the highway. Same day I had bought all covers and hardware at different local Cadillac dealer. Installed it myself and noticed that the old cover (pieces of it) was new (paper still attached to it) and had only half the required screws installed. I already knew the dealers are criminals, so I do my own maintenance on all of my cars. This was the only problem I had with my saab 9-3. I love it!"

So you want a stiffer suspension so that you can complain about the ride being choppy over bumps?
Okay, got it.

My review:
I've owned this car for a few years & feel if ever there was a time to write a review it's now. If I have but one complaint it is that the interior, while is nice overall, has components of it that just feel cheap.
Acceleration, gas mileage & the quality of this vehicle make it a steal as a used car.
Cargo room is awesome and the ease to fold down the rear seats is super handy."
saab,9-3,2007,drewtoo88, 06/21/2010,My First Saab and First Wagon,3,"Really like the looks of the 60th anniversary edition with the 17 rims. Black on black with the rear wing and front fog light. I get 23-24 at best. Highway you will get 27-28. Driving impressions: Stiff in the corners can be tedious on rough roads, lots of tire noise. Given this, it handles very well and passes like my VW GTI did. Corning is a blast with the manual mode. Inside impressions: Seats are really well done. The cargo area of the wagon is astonishingly roomy. Controls are nicely done and easy to operate. Back seat fit IS tight. The fit and finish are good, but a little cheap with some of the plastics. Over all though, it feels nice to sit in and look out of."

The free maintenance is awesome and then the National Hwy Safety top pick made me think that I bought the safest car on the road. I am very pleased with my Saab and really enjoy driving to work. Being 6'4 I fit very well in the seat and feel very relaxed. Best car I've ever bought. Hope this helps!"

After having worked with my local dealership, I researched and designed the car that I wanted.  Saab then built my car, and I flew to Sweden to pick it up in Trollhatten.  What a great adventure, with A+ service from Saab and it's associates.  A nice price savings plus generous travel allowance, hotel stay with wonderful dinner and breakfast.  Then driving it in Sweden, Denmark, Germany (can you say Autobahn!), and The Netherlands.  Can't wait to have it delivered here in 7-weeks.  Great performance, fuel economy, looks, comfortable seats.  Needs more rear seat leg room, spacious cargo area.   Titan Grey Color is sweet!  Thanks Saab!"

I owned a 1998 900 S Turbo, and I felt it had many pluses over the new 9-3.  Four years later, the changes to upgrade the model are startling, and I was sold.  The new 6-speed is the best manual trans. Saab has ever had, and the driving dynamics are superior to my old 900 in every way.  The car is buttoned down and feels smaller that it is.  I also really like the interior, which they've now made lighter and brighter.  The best thing I can say is that I started shopping feeling that I'd owned my last Saab, and after sampling the sub-$30,000 competition and the 9-3 2.0T, I fell in love with Saab again."

The Aero front seats are upgraded and really comfortable.  The back seats are surprisingly deep, be sure to actually sit back there.  I like the power the turbo Aero has available, but still get close to 30 mpg on the highway.  If I keep my foot out of it.  The car is a cross between cool and charming, and it's different.  Mine's been reliable.  It's a front- driver, so a Beemer will handle better on a racetrack, but I prefer front drive stability in the real world's rain or snow.  "

It's also nice to drive a car that's not as common as my wife's Altima.  Sometimes, I will see as many as 5 or 6 of the Altimas in one parking lot!

9 over speed limit and occasionally high 80's.
The car goes great, climbs the PA mountains with ease at any speed, accelerates on demand, and is wicked fun to drive. In town mileage averages 25. Not sure why my mileage is so much better than what others report except that I am driving a 6 spd manual and I'm apparently driving it very well:)

The controls on the audio system are not easy to use, though.  The cup holders are not all that great.  But, as a functional car, this car rocks.  I have to constantly watch my speed on the highway, drop it into 6th and it cruises, sometimes without thinking, I find myself at 85 or 90.

More often than not, people are surprised by the power, the speed off the line, and the PASSING POWER - love driving this car on highways (great seats, good size, great visibility for a modern car...at least the sedan is, not sure of wagon).  Not for those wanting quick respect from other ""car people"", but lots of fun if you want a practical compromise and still have a blast on an interstate."
saab,9-3,2007,John, 03/25/2010,What a fantastic power plant,4,"We have had our Saab for 2 years and 45k miles now.  The car has performed flawlessly.  The reliability has been fantastic.  Love dealing with my dealer for parts and the free service.  Would look at Saab again, especially now that they have their ownership issues under control."
saab,9-3,2007,Txsportscars, 10/18/2006,Best car for fun,5,"Howdy!, This car is nice, sharp and fast. The style stands out from other, the ride is smooth and fast. Don't waste your time and money with others."
saab,9-3,2007,Albator, 12/09/2006,I am not a Saab car salesman!,2,"Bought the 2007 Saab 93 2 weeks ago.   I had the following issues with the car: Spoiler had too much paint. They ordered a new spoiler and they dropped off a Saab 95 at home and picked up my car to replace the spoiler. The program in the radio seems to have a glitch. One of the buttons was not working properly. They resolved thes problem. The engine makes a funny noise between 2500 and 3000 RPM, some light buzzing noise (sounds pretty cheap). They could not reproduce the problem (hard to believe). Will meet the mechanic to discuss this. Fuel: 14.8 L/100km"
saab,9-3,2007,futureray, 12/17/2008,Very Pleased. I love this car,4,"Purchased this vehicle over a month ago. I had already done my homework and found the Saab Sportcombi was a great all around vehicle, and found one for less than a used 2007 Altima with standard features. Vehicle can be driven fast and fun, or more conservative, or like myself in something in between. With an automatic, I get 32 MPG on the highway, 26-27 in mixed driving, and 23 city that is great for a car that gives a nice ride, luxury appointments, and room to spare. One of my consideration was room for four, including 2 kids, 9 and 16. We all ride comfortably, I do have to give up a little legroom, as I am 6'-2"" but still find it comfortable."
saab,9-3,2007,Bossman, 01/29/2008,Lovin it!,4,"Purchased this Aero sport combi and put  1500 miles in the first week.  What a great car to drive, responsive, commanding, begs to go 80 plus.  Smooth and exhilarating.  Saab does a poor job in marketing casue this blows away a comparable BMW.  Some minor electronic bugs that dealer will handle- otherwise A plus.  Nav and onstar is the way to go.  Surprising hwy mileage less than 26, hoping to do better when I slow down."
saab,9-3,2007,odie6789, 10/29/2009,I'm in love,4,"Bought my first Saab, and I can't believe what I was missing!  This machine just cruises.  I keep jackets in the trunk so I can keep the top down, even when it gets cool out.  After about 3 weeks though, I brought it back to the dealer and had him reprogram the computer to defeat the daytime running lights (betcha didn't know they could do that, huh?). Now, off means off and on means on when the vehicle is on.  I was even brave enough to put a Bubba cup in the dash cup holder.  One gripe, I am having issues with the car reporting bulb failures that aren't there. Multiple trips to the dealer has not fixed this problem yet."
saab,9-3,2007,Bucky, 04/23/2010,Put this engine in a different body,4,"Now at 60,000K.  The sedan is definitely a small car but loves 80+ mph at 34+ mpg (on regular unleaded).  Interior is kinda cheap for a $30,000 vehicle and I am not too keen with the useless bells and whistles.  But it is clearly a true European sports sedan.  And no major issues thus far."
saab,9-3,2007,Seattle Saabster, 07/31/2007,Best Entry-Level Car for the Money,5,"I was looking for a car that was sporty, reliable, and had good gas mileage for my 40 mile r/t commute. I considered several cars at the <$30K price range, but was attracted to Saab's rebate incentive and my having owned Saabs for the past 20+ years. For the price, you can't get a better entry-level luxury car that equals the 9-3 SportCombi in performance, fuel econonmy, safety, standard features (leather, etc.) and practicality (cargo room, etc.). The SportCombi does not disappoint. The 6-spd manual (hard to find) is fun to drive, and I've been impressed with the 33 mpg I'm receiving on the highway.    "
saab,9-3,2007,bradleydallas, 09/21/2007,New and Improved,4,"I traded my '03 9-3 in for an '07 a couple of months ago and find the new car to be greatly refined over the '03. While the '03 was fun to drive, it was lacking in build quality and refinement compared to its competition.  Not so with the '07. Saab has really done its job to make this a fine car. Everything about the car has a quality feel. I bought the 60th anniversary pkg; what a great deal."

saab,9-3,2007,Debbie Swanson, 12/07/2006,What a Ride!,5,"Saab is one of the most comfortable, safe and fun to drive convertibles.  There is none to compare to it!  Born from jets is its mantra and it's easy to see why - you take off and you feel like you're piloting a jet!  What's even better?  Saab owners are a class all to themselves, and we belong to an elite club - we're ""different"" and ""unique!""  Come drive a Saab and you'll never go back to those spin off versions of convertibles.  Saab is superior - by far."
saab,9-3,2007,Robert G., 04/29/2018,Love at long last,5,"I love this car. Though it's a 2007, it has only 69,000 miles on it, it's immaculate, drives like a dream and can really move, though I drive conservatively and mostly in the city, but the few times I've been on the open road and briefly pushed it, it accelerated like a jet and still felt, as the mph increased, like it wasn't going all that fast and gripped the highway snugly. When I was looking at reviews for the Saab 9.3 before buying this one, a woman's review said of hers that it didn't feel like it was moving until she hit 80. She wasn't exaggerating. This car is worth infinitely more than its list value. What else -- oh, even though this black beauty doesn't look to me to be much different at all style-wise from a few other (black) sedans (e.g. Mercedes-Benz), Nissans, etc.  it still gets compliments so I'm thinking it must have some slight styling edge over other similar-looking cars. It is categorized as a semi-luxury car. It feels like it to me, not to mention it also FEELS like a sports car. When I took the car in for its annual checkup, the Saab shop had a new manager & he was astonished by the looks of the car. His first words: ""It looks like it's new!""
"
saab,9-3,2007,2nd Saab, 06/28/2007,"Great car, especially for the price",4,"Looked at the A4, S60R and TL before buying the Aero.  Traded an older A4 Avant (2000).  Turbo is a little flat in top gear passing, but I believe that's somewhat common in 6sp with turbo motors.  Lag off the line is there, but minimal, then picks up much quicker than the new A4 turbos (even the Saab 2.0T seemed to have better acceleration than the A4 2.0T, though the Audi is smoother).  Excellent on the highway, fun on backroads (excellent powerband from around 1800rpm on), with an easier clutch than on the Audis (both old and new).  The Aero's spoiler is VERY low to the ground.  Seats are comfortable, but interior controls/surfaces feel very cheap. "

saab,9-3,2007,Rip, 07/07/2008,9.3 2.0T +,4,"I have owned this car for about a year.  It has been all that was advertised by the dealer . .plus good milage (about 27 both C & HW combined).  The only minor points I have are the headlights are set too low. On high beam, however, they are perfect.  The stearing is also a bit "" squirrelly"", so you have to pay attention to your driving. Now, if only it had a little more kick!"
saab,9-3,2007,DanaS, 07/08/2007,Unique and Economical,4,"After owning a 2001 Saab 9-3, there were questions about getting a new Saab.  The 2001 was solid, but dated.  The car was designed in the early 1990s.   The new 9-3 handles better, has many more features, better layout, more room and is far better quality.  The doors, fenders and quarter panels have minimal gaps. The fit and finish is superior to the domestics or japanese.  I compared a Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and the 9-3.  When comparably equipped, the Saab was cheaper. The Saab rode better and there wasn't a gazillion on the road.  31-34 MPG during mostly highway driving.  GM should quit playing sticker games.  It scares too many potential buyers away and affects published resale values.  Its a good value when priced right.         "
saab,9-3,2007,yellow_dog, 09/09/2008,2007 anniversary edition,4,"Bought the car a few weeks ago with 22K miles on it with 100K CPO warranty. Excellent value given the purchase price, the warranty, the low miles and the fact that it is loaded with options.  The anniversary edition is fully loaded and handles well, surprising picking and response for a 4 cyl.  I came very close to purchasing the MB 280 instead of this, so glad that I didn't. This car has personality.  Gets 32 MPG on the highway with regular gas."
saab,9-3,2007,Dave, 09/29/2008,2007 9-3,4,"Excellent auto, wife has a A-4 all wheel drive, she would rather take the Saab then hers. Excellent mileage with all that get up and go. Trunk space is adequate. I use this as a daily commuter, I drive around 35,000 miles per year. Waiting to see how she handles in the U.P of Michigan snow. "
saab,9-3,2007,Brian K., 11/28/2008,WOW 2007 9.3 Anniversary edition,5,"What a car! This car is so much fun to drive. I just bought it pre-owned with 9,000 miles and have to tell what a great car this is. The performance is great and the seats feel like I am in a lazy boy. If you get a chance drive one. It must be the 2007 60th edition."
saab,9-3,2007,powder_chowder, 12/30/2008,"Fun to drive, economical, good value.",5,"Exhilarating and luxurious for the price with good gas mileage. 07' sportcombi wagon 2.0T 6 spd manual (only way to go for me) 17"" wheels, Nocturne Blue; all options except heated seats, which would be nice. At 25K  miles the car has been trouble free except the seat memory doesn't work; SAAB promises to replace. The mileage stated by Edmunds is severely under-rated; I'm averaging between 30- 35mpg combined on hilly highway/city travel, good for car with 210hp. The roof rack bolts on, making it easy to install/remove. I shopped the Audi A-3 (nice car too) and found it very similar in performance/handling, but the interior and trunk space was much smaller and Audi couldn't touch the price."

This is the car I should have bought 10 years ago, though it wasn't available ten years ago. Bose stereo is wonderful. Ride and performance are really nice. Punching the gas every once in a while is a blast. Road noise is not nearly as bad as my former Subaru. Interior design is lovely though there is too much hard, sort-of-cheap-feeling plastic. Rear fold-down seats really create a humongous hatchback-like cargo area. Dealer has been great. The warranty and maintenance are really top notch. Newer models don't have as long of a warranty. Roof rack bars look awesome."
saab,9-3,2007,JDR, 06/23/2009,Good value and great looks,4,Love this car and its unique look. Best of all are the leather seats! Every single person that sits in this car says he never felt so comfortable. Long rides are a pleasure in this car. The road feel and handling is great. Highway gas mileage is more than acceptable!
saab,9-3,2007,grw, 07/06/2009,60th Anniversary--Great Car,5,"Great pickup, comfortable seats and nice service plan.  I commute about 50 highway miles a day and love the ride.  The mileage is definitely better than listed.  I moved from an AWD and was worried about winters but it chews up snow with no problem, even moving in close to a foot this past winter. The whole car just has a solid feel to it.  "

I Bought this car new and have driven it for two years and 25000 miles.  It has been one of my best overall vehicle purchases considering my 50 years of driving experience. I am large, 6'3 and can actually stretch out in the front seats whether driving or riding as passenger.  Fold down rear seats offer great storage capacity to the trunk. Lots of interior room-considering that this is a smaller vehicle.  Warranty service has been great. Original battery died and one of the fog driving lamps went out, but both were replaced under warranty. (Florida heat takes its toll on auto parts). "
saab,9-3,2007,Steve, 08/24/2009,Love it - great performance and value,4,"This is my 6th SAAB. Looked serious at Audi A-3, but came back to SAAB because of value for $$. Bought new, now at 42K. Sport-combi, 2L turbo, 6 sp. manual, 17"" wheels. Loaded except heated seats. 34mpg hwy! 3 small problems so far; seat memory does not work (after dealer replaced the entire seat memory module, it still won't hold a setting - I give up), drivers anti-pinch windows needed re-calibration, some front end noise at around 20K (doesn't seem to affect performance).  I like that I can do my own basic maintenance. Snow tires in the winter and it drives to the ski area on powder days safely and with confidence. The rain sensing wipers don't work great; prefer adjustable intermittent. "
saab,9-3,2007,Sean D, 12/04/2009,Still Love It,4,Its been a great car through 20K miles. Only complaint I had was when I tried to change the tire and there were caps on the lugs. The special tool was in the glove box. I had to call the dealer to figure this out. Other than that I've really loved this car. Its the only car I've planned to keep beyond two years... or at least until the warranty is up. Too bad Saab could end up being wiped out. Dealership has been superb. I've been really impressed with the service. Car is very comfortable on long trips. I drove 2000+ miles in the span of a week and they were all a pleasure.

saab,9-3,2007,JDR, 03/17/2010,Too bad,4,"Good looks and safe car. The best seats for comfort hands down. The sad part, I have to boost the car every 6 weeks or so. Gone several times back to dealership, changed battery 3 times, changed steering lock mechanism, headlight bulbs burn every 4 months. Of course it never starts when I need it most! I.e., leaving on a trip to Florida with car fully packed with luggage and family, turn the key. No start! Call AAA for boost. What a pity. Cannot trust that the car will start! Fuel consumption in city driving is high for a 4 cyl, on the other hand highway fuel consumption is really good! I since sold the car as I will not pay premium price for a car that will leave me stranded!"
saab,9-3,2007,Taylor, 03/19/2010,A GREAT underappreciated Convertible,4,"A fun, unusual car that stands out from the crowd! Ultracomfortable car looks superb in White with beige leather trim, reliable with good gas mileage, this is an under appreciated car that actually has a usable back seat compared to any others in its class, dealerships are few and far between, they have a good track record for looks, reliability and insurance, I am a very particular owner, have had many cars but this one is way and above the best in all areas, many safety features, security is good for a rag top, would trust it to take me anywhere, more importantly I trust the car with precious cargo, my wife, she gets a kick from driving it and has never failed us. Advice, buy a used one as you save money!"
saab,9-3,2007,dgebler, 07/07/2010,Buy with CPO,4,I bought a 2007 to get the car at half price w/ 3 years left on CPO warranty.

I find the car to suit me well as it is small, yet seats four fairly comfortably, quick on its feet yet provides a nice MPG and its stylish without being pretentious.  "
saab,9-3,2007,realhwaker, 03/14/2007,Amazing car for the price.,5,It is just an amazing car for the dollar value.  You can really get some good deals on this car.  I bought a 2.0t with the 60th anniversary package.  They have great lease rates and you will be hard pressed to find this kind of car in this price range.  You also won't see tons of these on the road.

This is one fun car to drive and very comfortable.  I find that the rear set is roomier then Volvo S60, BMW 3, and Audi A4. The Saab has more features that are not even offered in the others."
saab,9-3,2007,Jenna, 03/07/2007,I love my Saab 9-3,5,"It's the best car that I've owned. I test drove an Audi A4, Lexus IS 250, and an Infiniti G35. I enjoyed driving the Saab way more and nothing compared to the super-comfy seats. You also get way more for the money. I get get really good fuel economy, about 30-32. It handles really well in the rain and it's quiet. I LOVE IT!"
saab,9-3,2007,Ken E., 03/21/2007,Great Euro Drive,5,"For the money, this is the car especially with the smooth shifting 6-speed manual.  Vehicle isn't quick off the line but plenty fast and stable at high speeds.  Much improved interior for 2007, great build, awesome paint color w/ Titan Gray Metallic.  Much better car in terms of fun to drive than the lower end Bimmers/Audis.  Pretty good gas mileage so far at over 25 mpg mostly city."
saab,9-3,2007,Guy, 04/13/2007,One great Saab!,4,"As a repeat Saab owner, the logical choice was to see what the new line-up had. Coming from a 9-5 I felt the 9-3 was an equal in quality and had a fresher look to the dated 9-5. The SportCombi 9-3 was a winner. The car is a hoot to drive and I know that Saab has built a very reliable car here that's stylish. Good going GM and Saab."

Truly a great car at a great price and fun to drive.  "
saab,9-3,2007,mrcook128, 03/30/2007,Different Kind of Car,4,"I have driven lots of other cars from Bimmers to Hondas.  Personally, I find it to be a beautiful car.  The drive is refined, with a more compliant ride than my Mazda6.  The steering is precise, although the body will understeer out of a tight turn if you're not careful.  The engine is leaps and bounds better than any turbo-4 I've driven short of the Subaru WRX.  The power delivery is strong and fairly smooth.  The much-maligned interior layout is perfectly simple to me.  The seats, though comfortable, lack any sort of grip, and are short on lateral support.  The 6-speed is a bit heavy, and can be a bit tricky with some of the throws.  The brakes are adequate and have good feel. "
saab,9-3,2007,Joel, 04/26/2007,Great Car,5,"I had a deposit on a pre-owned 2004 Volvo S60R and with the cash  rebate ended up getting a 2007 60th Anniversary edition in Ice Blue Metallic for the same price. This is a great car for the money, it is a fun drive like everyone else says - very peppy and agile, also the six speed manual is very smooth. I am 6'3"" and leg room is great, head room is just good enough as my hair sometime grazes the ceiling so if you are over 6'3 def make sure you have enough headroom with the sunroof. Overall extremely comfortable and very intuitive dash and stereo controls. I get many compliments on the cars lines and the spoiler on the 60th edition is a very nice touch. "

When I drove the 60th anniversary edition Saab 9-3, I was immediately impressed. Its curves and sporty styling cues gave it the edge in the styling department but what I enjoyed most was how it drove. I fell in love with the turbo power and torque that allows this car to launch, especially when you are already going 40+ mph. "
saab,9-3,2007,Jerry, 05/14/2007,What are you waiting for?,4,"Just took delivery of a 2007 60th Anniversary edition 9-3 2.0T on a trade for my '03 9-3 Linear.  Got the 4 cyl instead of the 6 cyl Aero because my driving needs don't warrant the bigger engine.  The 4 cyl is plenty of power and pickup.  Saab has this car totally dialed in now and it is amazing.  Pricewise a terrific value, safe and refined. There is no reason this should not be the leading entry level luxury sedan on the market.  Far more interesting and fun to drive than the Asian counterparts, and a far better buy than the other Europeans.  Drive it, look at how it's built, and get one while they last."
saab,9-3,2007,Matt , 05/18/2007,My New 9-3,4,"Head and shoulders above my prior 2000 9-3. Looked at Audi A4, Subaru Legacy, VW Passat and Acura TSX.  Saab prevailed on driving dynamics and styling. Upgraded stereo is excellent. The car is a tremendous value."
saab,9-3,2007,hbueain, 05/24/2007,Very fun to drive.,4,"Got the car with red metallic paint, looks great on the road. Very fun to drive, its 4 cylinder feels faster then my V6 Mercedes. Back seat is a bit too stiff, not very comfortable. Very neat interior finish, and the new dash is very easy to use. All the controls including the radio are very easy to reach and easy to read as well. The wide-angle rear view mirror really helps. Overall a great car. "
saab,9-3,2007,SAAB, 07/02/2007,Good Car,4,The Saab performs well and has a look that never dies. The only problem with it is that it had small problems like the radio blacking out and small things. They seem to be extremely forgiving with the car's good looks and performance.
saab,9-3,2007,Steve, 07/13/2007,Fun Saab,5,"I purchased a 9-3 anniversary model w/auto. If you are in the market for any type of car, compare it to a Saab. The car is fun to drive, feels very well built. Very, very quick. The anniversary package adds a lot of value. Compared this to a MB C230 and Lexus IS 250. It was no comparison when you compared fun to drive quotient, safety and price.  What a fun great car!!! "
saab,9-3,2007,Robert, 09/11/2007,Best kept secret,4,"This by far the best quality car I've owned so far, including my Acura.  It gets amazing MPG (30 avg), great turbo performance.  For the price I paid, I could not have bought a base Camry. Build quality is fantastic.  This is the safest car (class) in America today, Saab's strong suit and heritage. Not a creak or rattle yet.  Could you buy a better car?  Probably, but at a substantial premium.  This is my 2nd Saab in 4 years and reliability has been  excellent.  The fit and finish is right up there with Lexus.  Absolutely zero torque steer. 40-70 acceleration is like a rocket.  You really should consider this car.  It is a most compelling value in this market space."
saab,9-3,2007,Donatas, 09/19/2007,"2007 9-3 sedan, 6 speed manual, awesome!",5,"I was hunting for this car for about 2 years because I wanted it with all the options. 60th Anniv Edition came out in 07 and I decided to go for it as it had almost everything I needed. 2.0T has more than enough power and torque, and gets better gas mileage than Aero (I am not stating that Aero is not better). I get about 25 mpg in the city and 33 on the highway, and my 9-3 did not even break in yet. Not sure why people complain about cup holder in the dash, I think it's absolutely fine. Bose audio system is better than last year Pioneer, but not quite up to 9-5's Harman Kardon level. Clutch is perfect! No issues so far with the car, except little rattling noise in plastics around sunroof."
saab,9-3,2007,John, 06/22/2007,What a bargain!,5,"I traded in my 9-2x for this and it is amazing.  I really missed driving a European car.  (I had a 2003 Passat wagon before this.)  I don't know why everyone doesn't drive one!  I got 35.6 mpg on my way home from the dealer (2 hour trip).  I love the simplified controls for the radio, climate control, and the information display.  Much easier to use than last year's.  With the great warranties and free maintenance, you can't go wrong!  I was also pleasantly surprised to learn you can use regular unleaded!  Even with no options, this car is fantastic!"
saab,9-3,2007,ebeth05, 08/09/2007,Disappointing,4,"Purchased a 9-3 60th anniversary edition with high hopes for my first car. Loved the anniversary package, very happy about my first ever car purchase. Now I'm disappointed. The first week of driving I noticed a steering wheel vibration - a nuisance at low speeds, a violent shake at higher ones, not relenting when again at lower mph. After one week I took it shopping: took me five tries to get it to start; it turned on, then the engine shut off on the first four. I have taken it to two different dealerships to have the problems looked at with the frequent response ""problem cannot be duplicated."" Tires have been balanced twice, vibrations still exist."

It's also one of the few with an available manual transmission (and a 6-speed to boot). We can even fit two kids and a new baby in the back seat. We've only had the Saab for ten days but it's easily our favorite car ever. "

This car is everything it says it is and more. I drive 35 miles to and from work each day. At 75 mph, I get 34 mpg at 80 mph I get 32 mpg. I tried to do 70 mph but just couldn't, it was just too much fun going faster. The turbo acceleration is a blast. Going from 60 to 100 only takes about 5 seconds.

This car has done nothing but exceed my expectations in every way.  It drives great. It has excellent stability, wonderful seats. The top comes down real fast.  It look slick.

Terrific acceleration, effortless cruising, and 30 mpg at 80 mph.  Sporty yet compliant ride over rough surfaces, along with precise steering and effective brakes.  The seats are very comfortable over long distances.  Very little wind noise at speed.  Sports car perfomance with the utility of a wagon.  Lots of cargo capacity with the rear seat folded down.

Handling and performance are great.  The car is tight and rattle free.  It is NOT a BMW, but it didn't cost as much, either.  It's also simpler to live with and better in the winter.  It is definitely the best car SAAB has ever built.  "
saab,9-3,2008,New Jersey Saab Owner, 05/18/2016,Great Drop Top for Weekend Drives,5,"For a weekend driver the Saab price was a bargain. Why spend 40 grand  (what this listed for when new) to get that wind in your hair feeling, when you can get a used Saab that has some class to it?  

Granted it can get expensive, but I do a lot of my own work, brakes, filters, oil, plugs, belts etc. The car itself is solid, tight steering, easy to work on, hugs the road, very quiet for a cloth top, and the 2.0  turbo has plenty of punch. MPG is terrific.  The car is a looker, easy to park, gets plenty of comments and you don't see many of them around. The trunk with the top down can hold enough luggage for a long weekend.  This is just right if you want a nice looking car gets plenty of attention, and if taken care of the 2008 has good reliability reviews.

Since my original post in February I received two  recall notices, one for the airbag and another for the seat belt, both of which were repaired by our local dealer. The Saab sat in the garage all winter and was started up every week. I am using synthetic oil, replaced the spark plugs, new battery, put on new brakes, and enjoying the ride. Now the warmer weather is here, it has been driven several times with no issues and look forward to the weekends.  I now have 98,000 miles and it still runs like a champ.  I has a MR2 which was a good car, but had no trunk or room for storage. The Saab is easier to get into, small enough to park in tight areas, yet big enough to carry a few bags of groceries. The back seat isn't roomy, but is big enough for guests on short notice on a spur of the moment trips. We are very happy with this vehicle it, was inexpensive as a used rag top, you don't see many on the road, we get lots of compliments,  great gas mileage, and enough storage for a weekend jaunt for two retired people.

The only drawback is you need the OnStar feature for the Bluetooth to work. Since GM no longer services Saab, the buttons are useless. It doesn't affect the performance of the vehicle and isn't a crucial factor for me.

Here it is 2018, and  the Saab is still running great. A great car for a weekend jaunt, and love the compliments especially with the top down!

saab,9-3,2008,Al, 03/10/2016,Why the hell didn't I consider a Saab before?,5,"I was in the market for a new car and was looking through all of the usual suspects; BMW, Mercedes, Infinity, Cadillac...blah, blah, blah!  I had a very strict amount that I was willing to spend because of kids in college and having to purchase another vehicle for my wife and another for my daughter who gets her license in less than a year.  So, while I was looking I happened to come across a couple of used Saab convertibles.  I did some research and I could not find one really negative review.  That was cool.  I then called a trusted Euro Repair shop in my area.  We discussed the Saab turbo 4 cylinder engine, reliability. maintenance fees, convertible top reliability - a basic rundown of his experience of this car.  His overall input was that it was very reliable, fun and easy to work on car.  He stated that if I took care of it and was REALLY methodical about changing the oil every 2.5K miles, it would last a very long time.
So, with that I went to go take a look at the car.  It was Silver with Black interior and it was in phenomenal shape.  82K miles.  Very good maintenance records and it had been taken care of.  Car Fax showed everything was clean. Away we went for the test drive!
I immediately noticed that the instrument cluster is laid out very logically and easy to read.  I absolutely love the ignition being in the center console.  It's different!  I fire it up, drop it in drive and head out on the test.  Tight steering, front wheel drive 'pull' feels different than rear wheel drive 'push', but it bites and performs really well.  Quite, low road noise and surprising performance are things that hit me right away.  Seats are very firm but comfortable.  I approach the freeway and push the pedal down.  Wow!  Nice!  Great acceleration, handling and we quickly reach 85mph in no time and all of this while not even being in 'Sport' mode. I've driven and owned pretty much every import and I am embarrassed to say that I never looked at a Saab before.  The fact that the company is no longer around makes me wonder if they would have been a little more Marketing savvy, if they would still be around.  Who knows!!??  What I do know is that I love this car. Convertible top works flawlessly, it looks great, it performs incredibly well.   Gas mileage is exceptional given the performance.  Bang for the buck, I could not have made a better choice.  I'm looking forward to many road trips in this awesome ride!  Great fun!

saab,9-3,2008,saabtech, 12/07/2011,Earned Respect,4,"I had never planned on buying a Saab and in fact all I could remember at the time was how ugly the older Saabs looked. A friend of mine had a 2005 Saab 9-3 and the first time I rode in it I was truly surprised. It was far from the hatchback design of the S900 and it was quick and had nice fit and finish.
This began my passion for these cars. I have driven a 2005 9-3 2.0T a 2006 9-3 aero, and two different 2008 9-3 2.0T. All the cars I had were great although I did experience less than stellar performance in the Pirelli and Continental tires that they were putting on the cars until 2008 when the TMPS sensor option was included. I have been very pleased with the reliability of all the cars I owned and feel that the 2008 and up Model Years to have the best long term reliability. This is why I went ahead and purchased one after my lease on my first 08 9-3 ended. The overall fuel efficiency of this car is excellent and seems to beat many other makes for the power output that it gives. I worked for VW and Audi and have driven many of their cars and just dont feel that their 2.0T has as much power as the 9-3. Even though the 2.0T
for Audi and VW has been rated very high I know internally that there are still issues with oil consumption and slug in models that this engine has been used in, and thats why I would never purchase anything containing their 2.0T. The new styling in 08 really for me was a winner. I had appreciated the older design, but wasnt a fan of all the plastic rubbing strips and trim that was visible on the outside of the car. I was happy to see that the facelift was focused on the outside and left the interior relatively untouched. The only thing that I wish had been standard on the 2.0T is visible sports exhaust, and xenon option. I really enjoy the interior and the only thing I would have like to see is a little less plastic and more leather covered surfaces like on the door handles and the front panel that surrounds the radio and instrument cluster. The leather Ive noticed stays in good condition if you maintain it, however if you dont after about 100,000K the drivers seat gets pretty rough looking. In older VW models that have leather it holds up much better probably due to several seemed portions on the seat bottoms rather than one large piece that tends to get stretched like in the 9-3. "
saab,9-3,2008,DoninVirginia, 11/21/2010,My First Saab,4,"After researching manufacturers such as Audi and BMW, I chose the Saab Aero Convertible. My criteria included 1) fun to drive, 2) performance, 3) curb appeal, 4) amenities, and 5) price. The 2008 Aero Convertible had it all. The 6-speed manual is fun to drive, and performs like a champ. It has a great look, small on the outside, but comfortable on the inside. I love the Xenon lights and the Bose Stereo. 2008 was the right price point. And this vehicle, steel gray with black top, had been meticulously maintained, with only minor wear noted. The key fob is also really cool. Although the interior materials may not be up to others, it is not worthy of the criticims."

No slowing down in the corners, the car holds the road while the seats keep me steady and comfortable.

Ride and handling are way, way better than my previous ones. GM Ecotech engine could be more powerful but is extremely smooth and balanced.  Interior is a downgrade from previous cars. Guages look cheap and SID information display was better when at eye level instead of buried in speedometer,  but seats are super comfortable seats.  Fuel economy is much better than EPA estimates. I'm getting 23 in town with AC on and 29 in my daily commute which is 80% highway, again with AC on.  Fog lights should be standard and hidden exhaust pipe is cheap, should have polished tips. Great soft top - high quality."

saab,9-3,2008,Westie, 04/11/2017,I've never been so loyal to a car before!,5,"Disclaimer alert- I loved the SAAB convertible concept years and years before I was able to buy one for myself.  I had gotten my feet wet by purchasing a 2006 9-3 Sedan 2.OT, just to get into a SAAB (I had owned less expensive convertibles before that time).  As smitten as I was by the handling and the look of that 9-3 sedan, I missed having a convertible so much, so I decided to trade it in for a convertible two years later.  I purchased a like-new 2008 convertible 9-3 model in 2010, and my goal was to keep it looking as new as when I purchased it.  Well, it's 2017 now, and it really looks the same  as it did that first test drive.  All biases aside, here's my take- it's a fantastic deal for the money, especially now.  This is a car that was designed with safety in mind, and has pop up roll bars, safety alerts, and a number of airbags.  It's also a tremendously fun car to drive.  The four cylinder 2.0 turbo has plenty of power, and the turbo lag is fairly minimal, though I love the sound on a quick acceleration. The car is responsive, quick, and rides fairly quietly for a convertible.  It's also pretty well insulated in the winter, and gets excellent traction with the right tires. I have the cold weather package, which is a must in the colder climates.  As I sit here, I can't think of any unplanned repairs, either.  It's been remarkably reliable (knock on wood).   My only complaint is that I need to apply my high beams in more remote areas at night because the headlights aren't that bright (I had low beams installed, and that helps).  But, other than that, this car feels like it was built for the long haul, and I plan on keeping it for a very, very long time.
April 2019:I still have this car, and my feelings haven’t changed. This car still looks and feels like new at 78k miles (it’s now the fun “extra car”).  GM skimped on some of the interior technology then, so it seems a bit dated now. It’s not a deal breaker, though. It’s a great car.

The cars we drive for work are good but boring.  Not so with the Saab.  I'm having a blast driving it. I haven't had this much fun driving in many, many years.  Always looking for an excuse to drive anywhere, especially with the top down. The car is nimble and has a nice throaty exhaust - so different from the Asian cars I've owned. Exterior styling is not as thrilling as other cars in its class but that's OK because its unique styling has a timelessness about it that should make it a pleasure to own for many years."

saab,9-3,2008,Robert, 12/02/2007,Love my 2008 Saab,4,"Overall a really good car. Personally, I feel that the 2.0T is the best deal vs. the 2.8. I opted for all options except nav and auto transmission. The premium leather gives the sport seats that aren't otherwise available on the 2.0T. This feature alone nearly makes it worth the extra $$$. The leather quality is very nice (especially the French stitching!!). The manual transmission is notchy but nonetheless fun to drive. I must admit that I never really liked Saabs before, however this redesign really makes the car look wonderful. The taillight surrounds take getting used to but otherwise a really good car. FYI: upgraded sound system is simply average so I assume the base sound is terrible."

Even though repaired, the electronic locks never seem to work correctly. Even after being repaired it didn't take long before the locks were a problem again. Frequent and costly repairs have caused me to rethink my ownership of this vehicle.  You expect repairs on an older vehicle but the repairs needed are constant and costly.  I recently had my vehicle towed into the dealership and they said it was the battery and replaced it.  It worked for about a week after that and now sits in my driveway. I can't afford to have it towed for the repair (AGAIN).

The 2008 has zero remaining interior parts from its original designs, aside from the headlight and windshield washer logos printed on the corresponding controls. The 2008 thus far has had zero issues or electrical problems that were found in previous models. The quirkiness is thankfully still part of SAAB's design; its ignition, is located in the middle console, similar to the original floor concept.

There are copious amounts of space, both for cargo and large people.  Some plastics in the interior could be improved, but at the price we paid - no complaints."
saab,9-3,2008,Ric in ATL, 07/25/2008,"First 90 days: Good, but not great",4,"Picked up my 2nd 9-3 in April. It replaced my '05 Linear SS. I loved it & so I was sure I'd love my 2nd 9-3. Unfortunately, my Aero hasn't lived up to expectations. It's seen the Service Dept. way too much, mainly Bose radio & sound system issues. I'm now on my 5th visit to fix the problem. I missed most of my 3mos. XM Free Trial. I'm unimpressed with build quality and the materials in my Aero. I already have several squeaks & rattles. The plastics look and feel cheap, and I've already worn a hole through my floor mat.  All in less than 90 days. Mechanically, the car is great & fun to drive...when I actually have it. The premium leather is a nice touch, but $1500+ is tough to justify."
saab,9-3,2008,TheRas900, 08/13/2008,Great Car!,5,"I researched and drove many vehicles in this class, including the Acura TL, BMW 328i, Lexus IS250 and Subaru 2.5GT.  After having it for a month, I am very glad I stayed with the Saab.  The handling/ride balance is nice and I am getting 26.4 mpg in city driving on regular!"
saab,9-3,2008,Guintama, 09/28/2008,Very good and very pleased,5,"Now, I am not saying that there are not better vehicles out there, because there are.  Yet this does not deign the 9-3 of its distinction of being a great if not superb near-luxury vehicle.  I have own(ed) VW's, BMW, Cadillacs, and none of them have performed as well as the Saab for the price point, nor, being owned by GM.  I am very pleased with the interior finish, if it is a little watered down unlike the older, more genuine Saab, this one should still function in a few years.  The engine is great, a lot of fun to drive with its tight steering and great cornering.  Highly recommend it over all other cars for under $30,000."
saab,9-3,2008,Saab Fan, 01/02/2009,2008 Saab 9-3 Turbo X,4,"Just purchased Turbo X sport sedan and really, really love this car. Only had it for a day, but what a blast. Handles like it's on rails, power at the lower rpm, not like my previous 98 SE turbo. Very comfortable, but a bit harsh over rough roads. Love the exhaust note! Shifter a bit notchy, but I've only had it for a day and will get used to it, I'm sure. If you like Saabs and want a sports car with all weather capability as a bonus, there is no better car out there."
saab,9-3,2008,SaabFan, 01/12/2009,Get it while you can!,4,"I've had the car almost two weeks now and what a blast. Very quick and feels very solid. Love the exhaust note and the low end torque, which I wasn't used to in my previous 98 Saab turbo. If you like to drive this is a great car with the 6 spd manual. While the shift action may not be as smooth as I would like, it enhances the experience much more than the automatic version. While the MSRP may scare you, Saab's incentives make this car a great buy! Excellent car for the money and fun factor!"
saab,9-3,2008,simul8guy, 01/20/2009,'08 9-3 Aero Sportcombi XWD - Great car!,4,"Contrary to some of the criticisms in the Edmunds model review, this car is a great looking performer that's very satisfying to drive. It's amazing how quickly you get to 70 without pushing the go pedal very far. Great ride on the highway, this car is a cruiser! I've been getting doubletakes in this car that I'd never get in most of the other non-descript cookie cutter designs out there. The Sportcombi is very versatile without the typical station wagon look (I think it looks better than the sedan). With the incentives currently available on the '08 model this car should definitely be on your short list."
saab,9-3,2008,kilo, 05/07/2010,Great car,5,"30+ mpg, smooth ride, plenty of power, great visibility, loaded with features, zero repairs over 1 year ownsership.  Tons of room to haul anything both in car and on top.  We drive this car on 17 hr trips to Michigan - seats very comfortable.  Don't think a better wagon for the money exists on the market."

saab,9-3,2008,jay molluso, 04/03/2016,Tough love,4,"Love my Saab and now the car had a total electrical meltdown for a half an hour.  Then it started again.  The shop ran their scAn and checked it out and cannot find a problem! This happened a week ago.  Will I love it or lease it???? Update. Meltdown occurred several years ago. No problem since then

. update never had the electrical problem again.  The car is now 10 years old and ,with 41,000 miles runs beautifully. Just had it detailed and had to replace the top about 6 months ago($2000 ouch).  still love my SAAB
"
saab,9-3,2008,NOVA SAAB 9.3 Owner, 05/13/2009,Uncomfortable Seats!,3,"Maybe I just got a lemon.  The seats on this otherwise wonderfully fine convertible are HORRIBLE.  I really don't know what to do and I grimace every time I'm about to get into the car. Just for this reason, I recommend nobody consider this car."
saab,9-3,2008,TriHill, 08/07/2009,No wonder Saab is bankrupt,2,"The city mileage totally stinks on this car, between 10-20 mpg. For some reason on the highway, there's a disparity jump to 30-40 mpg. Great car for road trips, but I am a city driver most of the year, so this is not a good car for that. A lot of the electronics and computer systems onboard have bugs in them. I have had to take the car in at least monthly for these annoying fixes. Customer service is poor for things that should be covered by the warranty, particularly within the first year of car ownership where most of the problems have been happening. I will tell you that the first repair service wasn't an oil change...it had to do with changing a light bulb."
saab,9-3,2008,Ray Mesa, 07/08/2008,Poor Saab quality,3,"Surprised and the poor quality of the car Saab overall - trunk lid squeaks when opened, front door speakers are very poor quality, rear airbag cover fell off. GM has definitely had a poor impact on Saab. Customer service isn't any better in trying to fix problems. OnStar definitely needs to be removed -  in keeping with other cars in it's class bluetooth would be much better.  Navigation system definitely needs improvement."
saab,9-3,2008,Ric in ATL, 11/03/2008,Update: 6 months of disappointment,3,"This is a 6-month update. Check out my ""First 90 days"" review. My Aero has spent even more time in the shop since then. The stereo system is still a major issue, but now my problems have extended to the stability control system and general build quality. About to go through my 2nd set of floor mats. 1st service interval came at 6700. I've spent more time in a loaner car than my own car in the last 2 months. Squeaks & rattles have multiplied. This 9-3 has been a terrible disappointment. For a $40k car, it is seriously outclassed by the competition.  While I loved Saab, I feel totally let down by this car, and I don't plan to return when my lease is up."
saab,9-3,2008,Brian, 01/29/2009,Young man's sport sedan,3,"XWD, six-speed manual really make this car fun. It tracks very well in the snow and ice. It rides hard, even over medium quality metro freeways. So much so that on one bump I was tossed upward in the car and hit my head on the ceiling. I have been known to grunt in anticipation of road bumps. Maybe this is because of my bad back and age 43. I had an '87 Saab 900S several years ago in my youth and loved it. My new Saab is fast and fun to drive on smooth roads, but I may have bitten off more than I can chew. A loaded Accord would have been a better choice for me. Discounts made the car affordable, but I anticipate reliability will be below average; it's in the shop as I write this review."
saab,9-3,2008,SAAB Doyl, 07/12/2009,SAAB Driven,5,"Fun to drive, mocking a BMW with the MPG of a mini cooper.  3 years service with this lease costs the owner nothing.  Hope the new company purchasing SAAB keeps tradition... superior value for the buck!"
saab,9-3,2008,luxman, 05/08/2008,Best Car I've Owned So Far!,5,"I have wanted a Saab 9-3 for a long time so I looked at one last year, but I figured they were going to restyle them soon, so I waited. I'm glad I did, because the new one looks AWESOME! I got a silver one with all the options. Tan leather, wood trim, heated seats, 6 cd player, fog lights, and power seats. I like the headlights a lot too. they look cool driving at night. Standard satellite radio and onstar is nice too. This thing handles like a dream too. I have the automatic with tiptronic, and it is fun to drive it in tiptronic mode. If you want a high quality, sporty car for under $45,000, you MUST get this car! "
saab,9-3,2008,Aero XWD, 06/06/2008,Aero XWD: deffinately born from jets,5,"I had been waiting for so long for Saab to produce an all-wheel drive sedan. Here was my opportunity. I had a 2007 2.0t 60th anniversary, but I was rear-ended at high speed by a Toyota Highlander. My 9-3 was totaled. (100 % not my fault). I went to the dealer expecting to buy another normal 2.0, then I saw the new Aero XWD. It was the first one the dealer had received and it was the color I loved so much on my old 9-3 (Titan Gray). I drove it. And picked it up the following day. The 285 horsepower / 295 lb/ft of torque with the six speed manual is a terrific combo. No turbo lag and it's fast as hell. Handles seamlessly thanks to the haldex xwd. I average 25 mpg city/highway. I love it!"
saab,9-3,2008,Frank, 06/22/2008,You need to drive it.,5," As one who has owned many cars, the Saab 9-3 2.0t is by far the best car I've owned.  As stated the steering is so tight, I can almost make a turn with my knee.  The acceleration for a 2L I4 is wonderful, as my first ticket would attest.  The Getrag transmission is slick and smooth.  I laugh as I see yet another Camry, Accord or Maxima as they are seen everywhere.  This is unique, different and that makes it even more palatable.  The front-end and rear-end style is dramatic without being off-the- charts.  If youre well over 6 (I am 65, you will fit nicely and that says a lot about their engineering.  YOU need to drive one; it's the only way to fully appreciate it.  "
saab,9-3,2008,kellee, 06/22/2008,hot to trot !!,4,"This car is an absolute dream!!  People comment on the beautiful lines, especially with the top down.  Peppy, fabulous European design, interior is very functional and roomy.  Drove the BMW M3, Audi A-4 convert., Volvo and more.  This is the best, for the money, that I drove.  Sporty, peppy and a real cutie.  The A/C takes NO time to cool down and that is key in Texas!!"
saab,9-3,2008,Spencer Aronfeld, 07/20/2008,Saab-The Bedington Terrier of Cars,4,"I had a Saab 25 years ago and still dream about it.  I test drove every car on the market and nothing provided the drive, look, quality and fun of the 9-3 for the price.  BMW too expensive.  Lexus, too boring.  MB too common.  This is a unique car.  I leased it with an automatic (my only regret so far) in Fusion Blue.  Dealer worked hard to make the deal.  On Star is a great feature and already worked to unlock my car when I left the keys in side. If you want a unique car with lots of personality, I recommend it.  Make sure dealer puts air in tires and balances wheels before you drive off lot if, like mine, it had sat there for months.  Saab is a European car owned by GM.  Love it!"
saab,9-3,2008,Russ, Largo,"2008 Saab 9-3 Convertible, wow!",5,"Move over Mercedes CLK 320 convertible. I've owned one and the Saab is 12k less with far more features, standard features and the most awesome driving experience you will ever have hands down. This vehicle is the very best mixture of luxury and sport I've ever encountered. Its handling is crisp, yet comfortable and eager to please. It's as if the driver is one with the car.  Very simply, you put gas in it and the car takes care of itself.  It monitors all essential functions, has XM radio, OnStar, remote top down, additional lighting, superior guages, 3 comfort zones and so much more.  Leases included all maintenance and bumper to bumper warranty.  This is positively one sweet machine."
saab,9-3,2008,aborwick, 08/22/2008,A great car,5,"We drove the car to Gatlinburg TN from our home near Washington, DC.  The car drove flawlessly, nary a squeak nor a rattle.  The four-cylinder engine was economical, yet peppy and and provided six-cylinder power.  I found the dash ergonomics excellent, the seats were comfortable and the built-in XM Radio nice on the long drive.  There was no torque steer from this front-wheel drive automobile.  On-Star provided peace of mind.  This car is a good value in today's near-luxury market.  "
saab,9-3,2008,Bob K, 09/03/2008,Compromise,5,"Let's face it, if you are only buying one car it is a series of compromises to get what best suits your needs.  Sure you would like to have a M3 when you feel sporty and a 350 E Class for your date on Saturday night.  Although the Saab 9-3 might not rate best in class for any one category it does well in a lot of them.  I have had mine for about a month and am delighted with it in every detail.  It is a dream on the highway cruising at just over 2,000 rpm in 6th gear, rolling beautifully and extremely quiet.  I had a Saturn Aura prior to the Saab and find it worlds more enjoyable.  I recommend using 93 octane as I get 27.5 overall.  Could do better if you  use restraint with the turbo."
saab,9-3,2008,GaLawdog, 09/20/2008,Buy this car now if not sooner.,4,"Run, do not walk, to your Saab dealer and buy this car. Now. Not tomorrow. With only 600 imported into the US, and I suspect only 200 are Combis, this will turn heads and you will be one of a very few. High performance, and, yes Virginia, practical as heck. Took this bad boy through 3 horrible driving rain storms between PA and KS, and handled like it was on dry road. Messes bad with the heads of the young lads with hopped up Civics etc and ticks off BMW and Merc owners. High ego gratification while loaded with subtlety. Total aesthetic is well executed - a piece of Swedish art. Don't believe the tepid reviews - if you love cars, this is the real deal. Saab hits another home run."
saab,9-3,2008,JoeyDropTop, 10/04/2008,Awesome Car!,5,"I am so happy with my purchase! I have been interested in this 93 for some time now! I shopped for a while, compared, and I am glad to say that my New Saab is amazing! Fun to drive, and FAST for a 4 cylinder! LOVE the turbo! Love the remote top down! And gotta love the ICE BLUE color! "
saab,9-3,2008,ralph, 10/11/2008,9-3 2.0t sport sedan,4,"I found the Saab 2.0t sport sedan to be the perfect fit for my needs. I looked at the VW GTI, Passat and  Audit A4. The GTI handles like a sports car, but I needed something a bit more mature. The Passat felt like a Buick,  not bad, but not what I wanted. I have a lot of respect for the Audi A4, but did not feel it warranted spending another $6K. The Saab 9-3 was perfect! The 2.0 turbo is powerful, responsive and fuel efficient ( 32mpg average). The six speed manual has well spaced gears, and the clutch is very smooth. Overall interior / exterior quality and fit and finish are excellent for the price."
saab,9-3,2008,ChemE, 10/30/2008,Perfect for a tall person,5,"I am 6'6"" and the Saab fits me like a glove. I've had the car 3 months now and it's still a joy every time I drive it.  The last tank of gas I got 30.5 MPG with a little bit of spirited driving (~80% HWY). The 6 speed manual lets you cruise at highway speeds without the turbo (or loss in fuel economy). "
saab,9-3,2008,SAAB 4 Life , 10/31/2008,Back to Saab,5,"This is a fantastic car. As a owner of 2000 Saab (that I still have) I wanted to purchase another one just like it. After making a mistake and buying a VW Jetta 2.0 turbo that burns oil (look up vw oil consumption on any search engine) I went to a fantastic dealership in Florida (jacksonville) and picked up my Laser Red 93. I am getting 33 mpg with 4 people and a trunk full of luggage running 80+. Can't say enough about this car. It's just like the old one fast, reliable, smooth. I could go on and on.        "
saab,9-3,2008,AeroXWD, 11/04/2008,You will love XWD,5,"I purchased this car after my 2007 9-3 2.0T was hit from behind and subsequently totaled. I loved my 9-3 but also thought it would be a good idea to keep an open mind and look at some other cars. I drove an A4 which was slow and expensive with the options I wanted. The 3.2 V-6 felt simply lethargic. I drove a 335i BMW walked away feeling it was overpriced. The new C300 and C350 handled great but I was really unimpressed with how awful the seats and interior materials were for a Benz. The Aero XWD was a blast. Excellent seats, 280 hp turbo engine. I love my new Aero XWD. I have developed a lead foot and find myself at high speed on many occasions. It's the best Saab I've ever had.  "
saab,9-3,2008,BV, 11/05/2008,(I thought) it's what I wanted.,4,"I don't mean to be a spoiler to all the positive reviews - this is a nice car. I guess the problem is I had my last Saab (89 900T) way too long. It was the newer (after 2003) body style that really attracted me - I think it's a great looking car. However, I'm not into the white & chrome tail lights that came in 2008. It drives very well, power comes on quickly, quietly and before you know it your over the speed limit. But the seats are too wide and I slide around in corners. Most dissapointing it that it seems to be more GM than a Saab. Flimsy cup holders and console lid. On a recent business trip, I noticed my Chevy Cobalt rental car has the exact same radio as my $25K Saab. Uhh!"
saab,9-3,2008,SaabstudentDoc, 11/07/2008,Excellent value if the price is right,4,"After owning an 03' 9-5 Aero that was totaled while nobly saving my wife and me from any bodily harm I was eager to get back into the seat of a Saab. I was not able to afford another 9-5, but the 08 9-3 was nothing I ""settled"" for. The fuel efficiency is fantastic! I am getting 33 mpg on the highway and mixed city/highway I am averaging 26mpg (mostly city). The 9-5 I owned was an Aero and while the difference is noticeable, this car is more than ample. One word - turbo. My wife has a TSX, while this does not have the xenons and moonroof standard, this is more fun to drive."
saab,9-3,2008,LuvMySaab, 11/13/2008,"1st Saab,will not be my last",5,"I love this car!  Very quick, handles well.  I do a lot of driving, and the seats are the most comfortable. Interior is very ergonomic.  I am 6'1'', and I have more than enough room in the front for myself.  The interior is quirky, but everything is conveniently located.  I have the stick, and it is as smooth as silk.  Passing on the highway leaves others in the dust with the turbo.  Sure there is a lag, but who doesn't have one? I have been told by a Saab mechanic who used to work at 1 of the dealerships on LI, now in biz for himself that GM has ""ruined Saab"".  I just can't tell. "
saab,9-3,2008,magnetic1, 11/20/2008,2008 9-3 2.0t Sport Sedan,4,"The styling is great (int and ext) and elegant. After many test drives, there is nothing with more punch/dollar. Performance is impressive for 4cyl turbo. Peak torque and hp at low rpms means accessible speed. You're flying before you know it. Some turbo lag, but prep to ~2500 rpm and it's a rocket. Too much body roll on corners, but grip on the road seems unaffected. Mine is AT, but the MT is a joy. You've got to drive it even if not buying. Love the brakes...lots of expression.  As always with Saab, the controls become intuitive. Radio and climate aren't impressive. Some interior items feel cheap. Not bad for the money though. Like the gauges and SID in front.  Love the car. No regrets."
saab,9-3,2008,otto, 12/11/2008,Great Car!,4,"I own a Saab 9-3 Aero XWD 6M.  I have owned six BMWs.  While BMWs handle more neutrally, the Saab makes more power for much less than a comparable BMW (328/335 xi).  I would have to purchase a near fully loaded 335xi to get this much comfort, convenience, and performance at a cost of nearly $13k more. If you pay anywhere near sticker for these cars you are paying way too much. Wait for a GM year end sale.  BMWs are priced nearer selling price. Still, I prefer the Saab regardless. BMW's I-drive, run flat tires, and depreciation (net loss) were the final straw with me. I want a car that is fun to drive up to 9/10th, and this Saab delivers. I do not plan on racing this Saab."
saab,9-3,2008,tofutel, 12/04/2008,Saab 93 2-9 months out of the lot,4,"After 2 months, the shift knob gets sticky. Sticky shifting gets worst when in cold weather but very smooth when outside temperature is warm or when car gets a good 5 minute warm up. This is still a fairly new car!  I've had this car for 9 months now. Since then, I had brought the car back for service repair on the electronics on the window, the static on the speakers, sticky moonroof, and a flat tire. Other than that, car drives very good.  there is power when you need it."
saab,9-3,2008,RH, 12/29/2007,Great quality from a GM vehicle,4,"A very nifty ride for the price.  I was very happy to support an American company and get a vehicle that looks unique, has very fun driving characteristics and good comfort features without attracting the stereotypes associated with Merc and BMW drivers.  (not that i wouldn't love a nice Merc).  Acceleration from 50-70 is quick, turbo boost is very fun although low end torque is lacking, this isn't a drag racer by any means.  While the sport mode is fun and the triptronic transmission is ok, I wished I could have gotten an manual.  Guess they were quickly picked up nationwide.  "
saab,9-3,2008,WI Saab Owner, 02/16/2009,"Good Car, Needs Improvement",3,"This is our second Saab 9-3. It's a great car all around, stylish and a great price. Handles great in the snow, and the standard heated seats are lifesavers in the winter. The gas mileage is the biggest problem - we do mainly city driving and are getting between 15-16 mpg on regular. This was a change from our 2003 Saab that was a manual. I've also had it in the shop twice already for windshield wiper problems."
saab,9-3,2008,DonRobinsonRealtor, 02/15/2009,Love the Saab Sport Combi,4,"I flew up to Cape Cod the day after Christmas from Austin Texas to pick up my car. Left the next day in the rain and fog and drove back to Austin Texas. Drove 20 hours straight the first day I was having so much fun.  Hit the Smokey Mountains about 3 in the morning, drove like a dream.  I love the ergonomics and simplicity of the car. I am a driver and don't like too much power stuff. So far I am very happy with the car and think it is better than the write ups it gets. I agree with some of the criticism but still think it it much better value than many cars on the market especially if you buy certified used like I did.  "
saab,9-3,2008,Will, 02/27/2009,Never Follow!!!,5,"This is a great vehicle, no question about it! I had a BMW 535i over the weekend which the dealership let me test drive, because of my excellent credit.  However, at 35 years of age, I felt like 45 or older in it and besides, the place where I live already looks like a BMW dealership, because just about everyone owns one!  So, I took it back and started looking for a car that was just as good, but rarer, unique and with its own agenda.  That is what SAAB is, and that is what the 9-3 Aero is more than any of their other vehicles! This car is absolutely unique and once you actually see one in detail, you will realize just how different they are.  Never follow! This car really stands out!"
saab,9-3,2008,JB, 03/11/2009,Happy camper,4,"I traded a 3 year old Eclipse Spyder convertible for an 'executive used' (3400 miles) 2008 9-3 2.0T - bright yellow convertible !  My Eclipse was my second and a great car - but the Saab (my first) surprises me every day.  Automatic windshield washing - and running lights - (the lights turn into a right or left turn) - the seats are form fitting and very comfortable - the car holds corners at full acceleration like a dream.  I'm getting about 25% better mileage than my Eclipse - 26 - 27 mpg in all kinds of driving.  And it's Superbowl winning - Pittsburgh Steelers colors - what's not to like !  This is a great car, and the way I bought it - it's a great price (almost 60% of retail!)"
saab,9-3,2008,pmgreene, 04/06/2009,Best Value on the Road,4,"I love this car.  Saab has greatly improved the ride and build quality of the car.  I have owned Saab's in the past, and this one much smoother over the rough roads here in New England. Many fewer rattles and overall a much more refined experience.  The best thing about this car is the balance of fuel economy and performance.  I do a lot of highway driving, but I average 30 mpg.  I don't understand the EPA ratings.  I had a Lexus IS with the same EPA rating and never got better than 25 mpg in that.   I am very happy with the Saab and highly recommend this car to anyone shopping in this segment."
saab,9-3,2008,Michael, 03/21/2009,Nice Car at a discount,4,"I just bought my Saab a week ago and in my short time I am very happy with the car.  It is a bit noisy with the top up in traffic but the stereo does a good job of helping to overcome that.  The engine is energetic and delivers good around-town acceleration, the transmission is slow to downshift in the standard driving mode.  Visibility is ok, but the soft top does create some blind spots when up.  My fuel mileage was ok for first two tanks - avg 21.5mpg with mostly city driving.  I like this car, but couldn't see spending $44k for it as on the original sticker.  If you get a good deal, enjoy - if not, I think the other Swede might be a bit classier for the same loot."
saab,9-3,2008,me0101, 03/26/2009,Very impressed,5,"I've had my Saab 9-3 for a year now and have about 10,000 miles on the odometer.  This is my first Saab, and I primarily bought it for the incredible mix of performance, fuel economy, comfort/utility, and handling. I am 100% satisfied with the choice and have had zero problems with the car.  I would buy again w/o hesitation.  I hope Saab is around for a very long time."
saab,9-3,2008,Max Andrews, 04/11/2009,Truly Surprised,5,"We weren't even going to stop at Saab - I'm so glad we did.  Twenty years of luxury cars and convertibles, and I haven't had this much fun driving since my first Miata.  Traded from a Mustang GT Convertible, and ride is 1000% smoother.  Wish I'd bought one years ago."
saab,9-3,2008,rocky67, 04/12/2009,Great Gas Mileage,5,"I just purchased a 2008 Saab 9.3 2.0T. The car gets very good gas mileage.Overall, it gets 26 mpg mostly city driving. (Lots of stop/go red lights etc.,  speeds less than 45 mph). Straight all highway/no city you see over 33-34 mpg. Very good job Saab. My friends who have Mercedes Benz and BMW do not see good gas mileage like I do. Because most of the engines in the high-end German Luxury cars are close to 3L or 6 cylinders. My Saab has plenty of pick-up due to the turbo."
saab,9-3,2008,skm95t, 05/19/2009,Love my Saab,4,"I've had this a week and our family loves our Saab.  My 4 yr old always ask  ""Can we ride in the red car with the top down"".  The car gets pretty good gas mileage, it's quick and agile around town and on the highway.  The 2.0T is more than enough power.  The back seat is big enough to put our car seat in backwards, and our 4 yr old has plenty of room for many years.  Adults can easily sit back there.  The power roof works great.  The stereo, A/C, and all the other instruments are easy to use. "
saab,9-3,2008,RF, 01/02/2008,Excellent Car for a 6 + Footer,5,"Whilst I researched the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Lexus IS 250/IS 350 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, if you are over 6'' and have a semi-athletic build, you just will not fit in those cars.  While the previously mentioned are fine cars, and the Saab has its weaknesses, at least I can fit in it.  I don't care how well it hugs a curve, or how pretty it looks inside when my shoulders are smashed up against the door.  The car is fun to drive, period. "
saab,9-3,2008,JCinDC, 01/21/2008,"Saab Now, Save Greater",4,"Grew up around the 70s New Englander Saabophiles vs the ""Saab Now Cry Later"" crowd...their battles on quirkiness and reliability vs individuality and snow- going were legendary. Never much favored a side nor desired to own one, as not a hatchback fan. But caught the redesigned 2008 2.0T on the beltway, and now have taken the plunge. Got a loaded model sans the better stereo and bigger wheels - couldn't get those options with immediate availabilty in the smokey beige color. Just broke 2500 miles of daily commuting and two long road trips.  If not for some easily correctable annoyances and a little more zip off the line, this car could be a Best Buy and crush the competition at this price point.  "
saab,9-3,2008,Jim K, 08/02/2009,Excellent Car,5,"There isn't another wagon on the market with the Saab 9-3's combination of size, comfort, performance, economy, safety and value.  I also do not understand why the automotive press continually under rates Saab vehicles.  Nothing from Audi, Subaru, VW, Toyota, Honda, Acura compares - look at the specs - the 9-3 has more cargo capacity than anything within $15K of the price - assuming you want to drive a car and not a truck or truck like vehicle.  Reliability has been excellent - have owned two 9-3's -  gave older one to my son."
saab,9-3,2008,burt, 10/09/2009,"Great car, great price",5,"We have had absolutely no problems with this car through the first 41K - a first for me with new cars.  It is responsive, comfortable and fuel efficient.  If I had to find any knock on the car it may be that it does not idle as smoothly as a BMW, Toyota or Nissan.  I would buy this car again."
saab,9-3,2008,K28, 01/31/2010,a very special car,4,"I never though i'd own a Saab in my life, until one day when i randomly decided to drop by the dealer and take a look at the 9-3. After taking a test drive i was sold and bought one with the turbo 6...I've been very happy ever since, i am always fascinated when i get behind the wheel, it's really fast, fun to drive and at the same time it's the most comfortable car i've ever driven. No car has ever made me feel this good! "
saab,9-3,2008,Rob Murray, 02/01/2010,Beautiful Car,4,"I purchased this Saab 9-3 the day before Saab was bought by Spyker.  A Saab Sonnet was the first car I really appreciated when I was in High School and college and I always wanted one.  When I thought they might be going out of business I thought it was now or never. Car is beautiful, quiet, quick, and solid compared to the 6cylinder mustang, camaro, and infiniti G20 I previously owned. Nice car."
saab,9-3,2008,Jdac, 03/07/2010,Never knew Saabs were this nice,4,"I had been driving a sensible car for 5 years: Toyota Corolla CE; manual everything.  I finally decided it was time to upgrade and consider BMW, Inifiniti, Acura, etc.  I didn't really consider a Saab until an Acura I wanted sold.  I love my Saab 9-3!  The 2008 model looks great from the outside; it's a comfortable and is a considerable power upgrade for me.  The features are great and the value was unbeatable.  I highly recommend that you consider driving one if you're looking at an entry-level luxury sedan."
saab,9-3,2008,PGTX, 03/19/2010,Great car,4,I've been a SAAB fan all my life and finally bought one 2 years ago. I like the fact that SAAB design team is keeping the essence of the old 900 model through out the evolution to the 9-3 just like BMW or Mercedes do. Makes it a car that will not look outdated in a few years. 
saab,9-3,2008,ron, 08/07/2010,Great little car,5,"The 2008 Sport Combi is the 6th Saab I have owned and I have never had a bad one yet.  Do they have some weird features? You bet but do those weird features make sense. Yep. I just drove the 08 9-3 476 miles yesterday in 100 degree heat with the Cruise set at 78 mph and the car averaged over 32 mpg. Tight, plenty of power, fun to drive. I just do not get why auto writers never give Saab the time of day. Saab is roaring back with the new ownership and they have some super cars forthcoming. If you are thinking of purchasing a near luxury car you owe it yourself to test drive a Saab vehicle. Very reliable and safe autos."
saab,9-3,2008,Bill Anthony Resto, 09/10/2010,The other european,4,"Owned Audi, Infiniti, Mitsubishi and Ford cars, the Aero has the right amount of quirkiness. Love the car's profile and manners.  Very good reliability. Always wanted to have one and after almost one year of ownership do not regret the decision. "
saab,9-3,2008,Tyler, 09/27/2010,Superb,5,Cross shopped with the A4 and 3 Series. It's a real head turner with performance to match. Very tight build quality and mileage is great. As good as a compact executive vehicle can be.
saab,9-3,2008,jp, 11/30/2010,First Two Years have been Great,4,"I've owned my 2T Sedan for 2+ years and its been great.  Comfortable, even with two car seats in the back. Fully loaded for vacation there is plenty of room. The car gets ~24 mpg in the city (worse when my wife drives it) and ~34 mpg on the highway at a comfortable 65-70 mph.  Leather interior is easy to clean when the kids spill food/drinks. So far reliability has been impeccable...knock on wood because servicing will be pricey on this car. Useful speed warning feature as you can pass 70+mph easily. We bought a 2nd Saab (2009 2T Sedan) when it looked like Saab was going under.  Look forward to 2013 redesign although not in the market.  Wish Saab would remove some features and sell for ~20K."
saab,9-3,2008,DH, 12/06/2007,Saab 2.0T,4,"This car is fun to drive, handles well in the snow and has some nice luxery components.  The steering is resonsive and the mid-range acceleration is peppy.  The overall interior quality is on the lower end, but still nice.  The cabin is surprisingly roomy with a nice trunk and fold down rear seats for extra storage space."

saab,9-3,2008,Dave, 03/31/2008,Saab 9-3 > Acura TSX,4,"I was debating between the Saab 9-3 or Acura TSX. The Acura advanced in technology, but it seemed as if the car didn't have any soul, and it felt as if it was a Honda over an Accura. I bought the Saab with the stick shift, cold weather package, and the bi- xenon headlamps in silver with black leather. Build quality remains pleasing for the past couple of months I have owned it, reliability has been great, fit and finish can use some work, but suits my high standards. This car is worth looking at if you are looking at the Lexus IS and Acura TSX."
saab,9-3,2008,Mid30crisis, 03/30/2008,Initial Opinion,4,"I like auto transmissions, but a car like this needs a stick to fully enjoy the sportiness.  It does seem to roll a bit (even with the ReAxs system).  Brakes don't appear as tight on response although the pro reviews say the braking is great.  The starter seems to take a while to get used to; haven't determined if it's a defect or just takes a half second longer for the ignition to kick.  I like this car; great price point if you can get a good deal; if not, spend a little more on an Audi A4, Infiniti G35, or Acura TL."
saab,9-3,2008,Fernando, 04/12/2008,1st month of ownership,4,"I have own my 2008 9-3 for a month now, driven it both city and on twisty highways in coastal California from San Diego to Santa Barbara. Overall, I am very pleased with the car: great ride, amazing in the highway when the car settles and just lets you enjoy the ride. Based on other written reviews on line, I was concerned a bit about apparent manual shifter long throws and comments about interior built quality: my concerns disappeared once I got the car and started to drive it. 6 speed manual transmission works just fine, and clutch is great too.  In sum, so far this car makes me smile every time I drive it. "
saab,9-3,2008,Ron, 04/18/2008,Great car,5,"We use this car as our ""high mileage"" car.  This is our 2nd 9-3.  This is a solid car, great design. The car is perfect both in town and on the freeway. Could not go for the four banger as it just has to work too hard. The Aero is still great on mileage and a great performer. Only turbo I have ever driven with no noticable turbo-lag. Incredible brakes."
saab,9-3,2008,Flud, 03/20/2017,Wow a 150 mph car on a budget.,5,"Find a good place for service.  Drive it enough to keep the battery charged and keep the wheels balanced and you can scoot with the top down and have a lot of fun.

saab,9-3,2008,Canadian SAAB., 05/25/2020,The ultimate driving machine,5,"This car has a unique look that don't age like BMW, Mercedes.

It has been designed by air pilots, without compromise about what it will look like at the end. Your seating in a crazy seat, I do have, like in a plane cockpit, I night vision option, all light goes off except the speed. So, you are not blinded by the car's dashboard light. It has in 2008, more equipment than any current American, German or Japenese luxurious entry car...V6 Turbo XWD 300hp-300lbs, Dark night black, Mat gun metal mag, and much more. I have one of the 500 imported in the USA and Canada for 2008. If you could put your hands on one, I do a driving test, I bet you are leaving with it. It is a summer and winter driving machine that will never age badly.

saab,9-3,2009,Ken Krutsch, 05/29/2010,No better ragtop for the price,4,"Love my Saab convertible. Went from a Mercedes C-class to a 9-3 Bumblebee Yellow 2.0T convertible. I miss the acceleration of the MB, but the Saab 2.0T is not off by much.  The handling actually seems to be improved from the 2006 C-class, possibly due to the shorter wheel base and ReAxis feature (passive turning rear wheels).  I get a lot of looks in this car, which is fun, and the subtle design bells and whistles are everywhere.  For example, with the top down, either in hot or cold weather, the climate control seems to just magically adjust all of the settings for a comfortable ride - including the automated heated seats.  You can tell this is a car designed by people that live in the snow"
saab,9-3,2009,chris_gallucci, 02/03/2011,"ok car for the money, very reliable!",4,"Performance: great in snow! turbo lag is very high though
Comfort: over roads freshly paved-perfect, anything else-horrid!
Value: compared to other cars I have driven/ ridden around in it is not the best, seats are rock hard
Fun to Drive: Oh yeah!
Interior Design: great the first year it was out, but got old fast
Exterior Design: they are like Chevy, they keep almost the same design for a few years, then finally get the idea that people want to see something new
Build Quality: the best, except for a tank, I was behind a dump truck hauling logs (one lane road) it dropped a log 6"" in diameter, I ran it over, the car suffered no damage
Reliability: I can do everything at home (change oil, etc.)"
saab,9-3,2009,pl, 12/09/2008,Saab 9-3 excellent car for the money,4,"No one can drive this car and not appreciate the very smooth and adequately powerful turbo engine. Also, one of the safest cars on the road. As for gas mileage, it's consistently been 22 in the city and 29 on the highway, so the 18-23 quoted in the review is odd. Very comfortable to drive. At 26k, it's a steal. A great family car."
saab,9-3,2009,GET IT RIGHT, 04/18/2009,Gas Mileage,4,"The editor or writer has it totally wrong on gas mileage. Around town will be 20 - 24 , and highway is 29 - 32. Your listing of 18 - 23 is really not accurate. I think one of the better cars made. Saab never gets a fair shake from the press or internet outlets. Drive one and form your own opinion. Most people that have one, usually buy another.  "

Another year and I have bought a new Saab 9-3 wagon with a stick. I cannot believe how nice this car is! I loved my old Saab; this one is not in any way the same car. It is much nicer but I love it just the same. I am just a Saab lover, I guess. I never want anything else. I love this car."
saab,9-3,2009,Steve, 11/05/2009,A well-rounded car,4,The 2009 9-3 performs well in every category.  Excellent handing meaning just the right feedback from steering and feel of the road.  The steering wheel is thick with thumb support that adds to the sense of control. A sense of control of the car in every situation - even in snow storms and driving rain.  Comfortable seats that are appreciated more on longer driving trips.  Easy to reach and understand dashboard - nothing too fancy like most higher end cars. Good views of the road.  A safety record unmatched by most cars - check out the insurance loss chart on the IIHS site - Saab is either the safest or the top two or three safest cars on the road.  Why?  Re-read my comments.
saab,9-3,2009,antonio787, 12/18/2010,my headache...,4,"After three months of use my car started with a noise in the front suspension upon riding over street bumps. I made an appointment and my car was taken for service and repair March 22, 2010. Mileage: 4849. The car was ready the same day. First maintenance done.

After a few months the noise in the front suspension started again. Also a new noise started at the driver's seat. I made another appointment. On June 7, 2010 the car was taken for repair again. Mileage: 8644. The car was seven days at the shop. out of shop June 14, 2010. 

The noise persisted at the suspension and this time was stronger. I took the car the 8th of July, 2010 for evaluation and a loosen knob at the bushing was found and fixed the same day. 

On September 20th, 2010 my battery died and they changed same day for a new one. Same day service. Mileage: 13344. This same day the car was re-evaluated by the mechanics because the noise in the front suspension and in the driver's seat decreased but were still present. Another appointment was done and the parts were ordered. 

Appointment was done for the first day of November, 2010.
My car was at the shop until November 4th and the parts were never available, so they did not fixed the car. Only thing done was the maintenance check up. Mileage: 14969.

Appointment follow up for parts previously ordered was given for November 15, 2010. I picked up the car Friday 19th of November. Still the car was with the same noise in the front suspension and at the driver's seat. On Monday 22 of November another visit to the shop was done. In view that this was a short week (due to Thanksgiving holiday) they gave me another appointment for service for the 29th of November. The service light was not reset and it was ON at all times. 

The 29th of November my car went again for service for another week. Mileage: 15799. When I picked up my car Friday 3 of December the car was still with the same or worst noise in the front suspension and at the driver's seat. 

Total of visits for the same problems: 6
Total of days in shop for repairs and evaluation: 20 days
Problems unresolved: Front suspension noise and driver's seat noise

I use my car on daily basis for work. For me is important to have a save car. This noises are obnoxious and persistent. Every time the car is in the shop they change a different part of the front suspension as if they were guessing what the car problem is. The front seat cushion has been replaced twice. The truth is that they have never fixed any of these two noises. "

saab,9-3,2009,RTP Econo Driver, 05/18/2010,Wow - Great Deal on Great Car,5,"Took advantage of SAABs troubles to purchase a 9-3 at 0.0% financing.  Got the stripper model - no roof - manual passenger seat - 6 speed manual.  Bright red.  Great car.  Downside - no heated seats - no fog lights.  Upside - roomy.  No matter what Consumer Reports said, build quality is top notch.  Shifter little balky, but no worse than previous Audi's.  Clutch very easy.  Turbo took a week to get used too, but concerns over torque steer overblown.   Gas mileage is really good - surprisingly so.  Went from a Cad CTS to a Mazda6 to cut payments and get more gas mileage - after 1 year - went to SAAB with - lower payments and better gas mileage!  "
saab,9-3,2009,John B., 02/11/2010,More bang for your buck,4,"Editorial reviews rate the SAAB 9-3 low compared to the competition in nearly every category but one - price.  The sticker may be high but that doesn't reflect the actual price, which is much lower than the competition.  If you are splitting hairs then perhaps the editorial reviews are correct, but for the everyday driver this is a fine car over-loaded with power, comfort, and features compared to other cars in its price range.  When my wife and I went to buy a new car she was adamantly opposed to buying a SAAB because of the latest troubles - then she drove it.  For the price we got ($23,000) there was no comparison to the Mazda, Honda, Subaru, or Nissan cars we looked at."

Coming from a Mini Cooper S, the fun factor is not there since the Mini is so much fun.  But the 4 doors and huge space in the trunk and backseat are nice to have again.

Recently traded a 2006 S60 wrought with problems for a slick, black 2009 93 and I couldn't be happier.  Same perks as other ratings - a blast to drive! great acceleration, comfortable, sporty, handles great, better MPG than advertised.

In my first two months of ownership, I've come to appreciate the outstanding acceleration of my Saab while experiencing awesome gas mileage (until I just reset it, my mileage calculator registered 29.7 mpg for a full month's worth of driving), far better than expected.  Heated seats, rain-sensing wipers, quality climate control all make driving a pleasure.  My impeccable timing -- I bought the car just before the Spyker deal was finalized -- yielded me a new entry- level luxury car for $23,400, a huge discount from the $36,500 sticker price. "

Now we have matching cars which should be good from a maint. standpoint since I will do it after the 3-yrs is up.  My old Subaru was reliable.  I hope this 93 will be, also.  "

I prev had an 06 CTS that was great - sold it last year to improve gas mileage and got a great Mazda 6 - but no soul.  Saab is great.  Mine has a stick - it's a little bit fussy...exactly like Audi's used to be so to me there's no issue.  The clutch pedal action is light - pick up is good.  Perfect seats and instrumentation - base level stereo is good.  Stripper wheels 16 inch - look good on this car, and saves $25.00 per tire when it's time to buy new rubber.  I really like this car!"

I expected the rear-end to be crushed when I got out of the car. It was minimally damaged and I was shocked. Very impressive!

Very happy with this car.
Purchased a ""stripped down"" model at the going out of business sale - did not get the BIG deals that others claimed to have gotten, but I did get a 0.0% loan!!

6 speed manual - overall car is very good.
It's comfortable and good on long trips.
I average 30 MPG COMBINED in the real world - pretty psyched about that - I will generally be in the high 30's on the highway.
That's great mileage.
I don't play boy racer, and generally only go about 5 MPS above posted limits on the highway which probably helps my mileage.

Back seat is tight.
Fold down rear seats nice.
Rear air vents are nice.
GM warranty is nice."

It doesn't have a great interior compared to say an Audi A4 (my previous car), engine is not sublime, handling is OK (AWD helps considerably though I bought FWD version), brand cache is struggling and I will have to see on reliability. But after 2,000+ miles of driving, I have no major complaints. It's a good all around performer and if it doesn't quite excel in any obvious automotive review category, does enough to satisfy and bring the occasional smile. "

Saab's tasteful design, functional and pleasing layout of controls, good fuel economy, safety, and good looks all factored into the decision.  In the end our 7 year old Saab (purchased used) sold us on the new one.  After several years of ownership, we still flip a coin over who gets to drive it.   Instead of a van or CUV that doesn't handle like a car, we have a car that handles well, and still will accommodate a lot of stuff."

I currently have 162,000 miles on it and it has been extremely reliable. The engine runs great and so far the transmission has worked fine as well. I had to replace a drive shaft at 100K miles and a wheel bearing at 140K miles. As of today with 160K miles, I do need rear CV boots, a front vacuum pump and a transfer case seal. It would cost me approximately $1,850 to repair all of those items. I don't know if I will bother spending the money to fix these issues since I have so many miles on the car. I have to say though, it has been a fun car to drive and it has never failed me. I have always serviced it as per the manufacturers specs and I'm sure that's partly why it has run so well. .... A little about me, I am 5'-6"" tall and the seats and cabin room are perfect for me!

I could not pass up the deal on this vehicle. Almost $12k off sticker. Despite what they say as this being an outdated car with not a lot to offer compared to the 3 series, A4, etc could not beat the price with this one. "
saab,9-3,2010,Sean Lucander, 04/09/2017,"2010 Saab 9-3 XWD with 64,000 miles",5,"We bought the car in 2015 with 48000 miles. We love how well it does in the snow, we live in massachusetts and weather can be crappy at times. The fuel economy could be improved, however, i knew what we were buying so i'm not complaining. I would sacrifice amazing all wheel drive for 4 fewer mpg. we get 24 overall. On a trip from Worcester, MA to Lake George, NY we averaged 29. The car is fun to drive, simple to use. All the controls are easy and not confusing. The interior is nicely finished. The hard plastics are definitely chintzy general motors product. I also have a 2014 camry se v6 and the interior and fit and finish is not as good as the 2010 saab! The seats fold down and split 40/60. The dealership where we bought the car sold us a warrantee. We have used it three times in the 2+ years of owning the car. It is well worth it knowing that the parts come from Sweden and they do not manufacture saabs anymore. I would not like the car as much if i didn't have the warrantee. When people review cars, they need to realize that what they are buying is the same car they test-drove. That being said, know what you're getting yourself into and you won't be surprised with normal maintenance, do your homework and know a great saab mechanic. My family has driven saabs since the 70s. I have know a few people who have walked away from bad car accidents. They are safe as hell and well worth the premium in repairs. the saab has 210 hp, but has amazing passing power on the highway and feels more secure than other cars I have driven. Sadly, we traded in the Saab in sept. 2017. My boyfriend and I regret getting rid of the Saab. We were both struggling financially and he traded it in for a Passat lease. I like the vw but we miss the Saab everyday. Wishing we had kept it. We traded it in with 69,xxx miles and issues after we replaced the instrument cluster and car computer.

My car has Onstar and I like the turn by turn navigation which shows the directions on the radio display. I got a great deal on the car.       
saab,9-3,2011,jbrtp, 05/21/2011,Love My First Ever SAAB,5,"Disagree with reviewers - know the new one is coming but a great deal with 0.0 financing sold me.
First interior - yep - radio is a generation old and was plucked from the Suburban but sound quality is good and there is a jack.
No gaps in my interior - all tolerances are close and materials are good quality.

Car is quick with little torque steer - steering is spot on and ride is comfortable.
Brakes are superb.
Gas mileage is GREAT much better than expected.
I have some trips with 35+ on the highway.
Would have liked power seats on the passenger side.
Bluetooth is basic but works well with android phone.
Headlights are good as well.
Manual 6 speed can be a little notchy."

The mid-range acceleration of this car is amazing and there's no turbo lag. I like how the engine is 2.3 liters instead of 2.0 because it makes it so there's not as much lag and the car doesn't have to rely on the turbo as much so the power band is much more linear. If you get this car make sure you get the Aero. It's the best model. It gives you 230 HP according to Saab (But it's been said to be more like 250) and 258 lbs. ft. of torque. It feels even quicker than that though and it can really handle in the corners as well. The steering quickness and feel is excellent and it provides good road and even engine feedback!"

It all started with the timing belt and went down hill from there, oil sludge blew the engine, a bad ABS modulator that disables the ABS braking system. 2, yes 2 alternators, computer systems, crank sensor, alarm system, and LED display to name a few. My dashboard is a constant display of warning lights and the costs of my repairs are well over $6200. Well over what the car is worth now. I love this car, but it has broken me."

Since owning it I have replaced the following: turbo, crank position sensor, the coil pack (3 times) and a few other smaller parts. As I write this the car also has an oil leak and the power steering is going out. It is also having trouble shifting and is lagging in power. I know cars take time and money to keep running, but this one has been taking more money than I'll be able to get out of it. I would not recommend this as a 1st car or even a 2nd, that is if you are the one paying for everything done to it.

Was expensive to fix and never was able to fix it. Oil bled into the brake lines. Blue smoke everytime I started it. Finally had to pawn it off to a dealer as a trade-in. LEMON.

We have had the car for about 30k miles now and have not had a bit of trouble out of it. The 9-5 has been great. I am suprised that they really arent more expensive on the used market. They really are one of the best buys out there.

They fail regularly and cost $450+ per distributor to replace (there's 2 on the V6).  It's a great car and fun to drive, but OOH THE COST TO FIX!

Drove it already for around 8,000km during last 2 months, mostly highway driving, and Aero performs extremely well on the high- speed. Overtaking is a blast, and acceleration, even with the automatic transmission, puts that nice smile on your face. Sport mode is must on the freeway. Aero drives and handles like a small sports car providing comfort of the luxury sedan. In my opinion exterior styling of the Aero model is a work of art that stands out of the crowd."

And 2 months later the entire belt tensioner blew, causing the serpentine belt to snap, causing a melt down. The list goes on. In the course of a year, I spent $3000  in repairs.  The shameful thing is that I love driving this car so much, I actually considered getting another one.

thing has broken. I have not even had an 
adjustment for the dealer to make. 

The dealer experience is exceptional. I 
don't pay for anything when it come to 
regular maintenance every 10k. I get a 
loaner and the car is done when it is 
suppose to be.

Lots of space and versatility."
saab,9-5,2000,timsmith, 11/22/2002,Great car-great lease,4,"This is my third Saab.  Although I miss 
the quirkiness of my old 900s, this 
vehicle is head and shoulders above our 
old 9000cs.  The car has cost us next 
to nothing to drive (especially once 
you consider the extremely reasonable 
lease packages Saab is putting 
together).  The car has never been in 
to the shop for anything other 
than ""scheduled maintenance,"" and 
Morries in Minnetonka, MN is even a 
reasonable place for an hour coffee 
break.  I have really enjoyed this car."
saab,9-5,2000,Georgia Saab, 12/08/2002,Very Poor Customer Service,3,"I have grave concerns about the 
vehicle's reliability and Saab Customer 
service.  As soon as we bought it, the 
car broke down during a move to GA. 
Trips to the dealership (one over a 
week) failed to resolve the issue.  We 
still continue to have problems with 
the car.  The Saab Customer Service 
department was extremely antagonistic, 
unhelpful, and even untruthful.  The 
car continued to experience many minor 
deficiencies during this time.  To 
date, all issues are still unresolved, 
and we have lost faith in the car's 
reliability, the Saab warranty and 
customer service department. Knowing 
what I know now, I never would have 
bought this vehicle."
saab,9-5,2000,Washout, 01/13/2003,Can't wait to give it back!,3,"When I 1st leased this car I 
thought I'd grow to love it. Now I 
can't wait to turn it in. Initial 
build quality was 
not good. Panels popped 
up and burnt out bulbs. Handling
was fine and the interior was comfy 
and well laid-out. In
the 2 years I've had it I've had 
mysterious display problems, many more 
burnt out bulbs and 
incredibly crappy gas mileage. 
Exterior styling and finish is 
not aging well. It makes me glad my 
lease was only 3 years.It's VERY pokey 
off the line, 
with power only at freeway speeds. 
Extremely annoying."
saab,9-5,2000,RaviSingh, 07/09/2003,Saab Aero is fun,5,"I have driven a number of European 
vehicles over the years.  The 2000 
Saab Aero has definitely been the most 
fun to drive.  After leasing it on a 
42 month lease, I have decided to buy 
out the car.  

It is ergonomically built for the 
driver's comfort.  Things which others 
find Quirky such as the ignition in 
the middle is actually much safer as 
the key and lock mechanism is known to 
cause knee injuries.

This car has a 230hp engine and goes 0-
60 in around 6 seconds.  
Excellent safety record, great 
preformance and outstanding handling."
saab,9-5,2000,Debra M Fish, 07/11/2003,It is not our problem!,4,"Front toe setting was off from the 
beginning & the car pulled to the 
right. The dealer could only modify it 
slightly. By that point, the front 
tires were worn so badly they had to 
be replaced. 
The follow have had to be replaced:At 
least 6 key remotes, rear shocks, 
throttle body, digital display, 
ignition module.On a snowy day, the 
parking brake would not release &  
warning lights lite up. After sitting 
in the dealer's heated garage all 
night, the car was fine. The 
hypothesis my service adviser had was 
that some part of the braking 
apparatus had frozen & needed to 
thaw.  
Saab's only response:As cars age, 
items simply have to be replaced. "
saab,9-5,2000,porterjs, 08/23/2003,"Enjoyable car, but some sticky points",4,"Some quirks and some warranty-covered 
reliability issues have not hindered 
the enjoyment of this car. The car 
rides very nicely and has enough power 
for both around town and some speedier 
highway driving. The interior layout 
and ergonomics are superb, and 
generally build quality is good. Two 
new turbos (one likely not installed 
perfectly) and a tendency to go through 
a lot of light bulbs and a couple of 
batteries have tried our patience at 
times - as has the lack of dealer parts 
inventory once or twice. The cargo room 
is quite good."

crammed with content, joyously quick, 
solid, well-thought-out, safe, quick, 
still under warranty, fun to drive, and 
did I mention it is quick?  The new-
Saab dealer seems to want to take very 
good care of me, but the local used-
Saabs-only dealer is a better bargain.  
I get 21-32 MPG and can rip off 6.6 
second dashes to 60 and under 16 
seconds to 100.  It feels very composed 
above 125. 
Despite the good things I've heard 
about its reliability; I'll probably 
buy an extended warranty before the 
50000 mile factory warranty exires; 
some of the parts for this car are a 
bit expensive and I want to keep 
it for a decade or so."
saab,9-5,2000,malapides, 03/28/2005,Top Notch for the Aero,5,"This vehicle has provided a range of diversity with regards to comfort, performance, efficiency and practicality.  I regularly take road trips with bikes on the roof, or gear in the wagon area along with friends.  The car gets me there quickly with it's powerful turbo engine (I do have the 5-speed), in comfort (the ventilated seats are a must in hot weather) and efficiently (frequently 30-32 mpg highway).  I highly encourage anyone buying this car who lives in a snow belt to absolutely buy a second set of wheels/tires for the snow.  This makes a huge difference. Overall, I could not be happier with thie vehicle.  With 75,000 miles on it, there have been no significant repairs."
saab,9-5,2000,cueball1, 10/23/2003,Love the 9-5 aero,4,"This is a great car.  It was purchased 
used with only 27000 miles.  I can't 
imagine buying one new and eating the 
horrible depreciation, but what a 
bargain used for under $20000.  This 
car makes amazing power, is incredibly 
smooth, handles great and you don't 
pass yourself on the road every 5 
minutes.  Drove this car 13 hours 
straight at nearly 80 MPH and it got 
an amazing 32 mph.  Ventilated seats 
and the cooler in the glove box are 
great when on the road long distances. 
Quirky sometimes means imaginative. 
Terrific car for the same price I 
would have paid for a boring mid line 
accord or camry."

just about anything and it handles

spools early, so there's no lag and 
the highway passing power is better 
than many v6's that I've driven.
The interior is luxurious and the

great.  No regrets."

I was looking for something fun to drive, had great curb appeal, seats 5 and wasn't what everyone else drove.  I found my car online from a private party 900 miles from MN.  This car averaged 29mpg from VA to MN.  Lots of low and nid range torque.  60-80mph is a blink of an eye.  This car is the best performance for the money.

I wanted it to be fun to drive,

wanted it to be unique.  This car fits 
the bill, I have the manual trans and 
it is great!  The turbo lag is non-
existent (perhaps someone with more 
skill notices a turbo lag) it looks 
great, it's comfortable for 4 people 
(including rear heated seats).  My only 
complaint is with the cupholders - 
although everyone talks about how cool 
the folding cupholder is, it only holds 
standard sizes and sometimes it's 
difficult to get the can out."

Saab's recommended maintenance has been 
followed consistently, and only Saab 
parts have been used.  Now at 225,000 
miles everything works flawlessly.  I 
expect to put between 300,000 and 
400,000 miles on the car before 
replacing it with another new Saab Aero.

Today, the car still gets 27-30 mpg on 
the open road at cruising speeds of 70-
75 mph; weather is the major cause of 
variation in mpg when speed is in this 
range.

been enjoying a smooth, comfortable 
ride with little to no quality 
problems. I would definitely recommend 
this car to other purchasers, 
particularly the certified pre-owned 
program at Saab. The trunk space is 
fantastic, and it drives great in the 
harsh winter weather on icy roads (I 
live in Michigan). A very safe feeling 
car. My only complaint is a little big 
of lag in the acceleration, but it's 
not so much that it drives me crazy. 
Overall a great car at a solid price."

Ride is excellent, lots of power, great ergonomics/comfort.  I bought a used car w/49K miles, however the turbo blew at 53K (covered under warranty + free towing), the paint is VERY fragile (has gouges in hood from the tow, and keeps getting scratches in parking garage from other drivers resting briefcases on the trunk, top).  I am now taking maintenance VERY seriously (there are several other common problems).  However, for the safety, performance, and style there is no equal."

My 2001 was in the shop when I spied the 2000 silver wagon. The little 4-banger put the V6 to shame on my test drive. I was shocked to find out it was a 4-cyl! I absolutley love the way this car handles. There is the old 0-15 mph lag w/ the AC on, but I'm a highway driver. I have a set of Winter wheels that I use for my excursions in snow and ice. I have put many SUV drivers to shame in severe snow storms. If only they knew it was about the tires. The Saab experience has been great with the following exceptions: 5+ broken fog lights, burnt out bulbs, DIC."

saab,9-5,2000,Ipse Dixit, 11/15/2005,ABS Module,4,"After replacing my own DIC (or IDM) for $319, I encountered another problem 2 months later.  Warning lights on the dash came on; ABS, Warning Triangle, TCS. The speedometer and odometer stopped working. This all eventually causes the CEL to come on as well. I had it in the shop, did some research, reported this all to Saab USA. It turned out to be the ABS ECU. My service shop called Saab to see if they'd pick up the $2500 repaur cost. Saab offered to pay 1/2 and no labor (about $450). I said ""no thanks"" and did it myself for about $500."
saab,9-5,2000,danesh, 11/25/2005,Great Car-But has problems.,4,"I have always been drawn to the unique style of Saab cars, so when the lease on my 9-5 2.3t ran out I fell in love with the aero after just one test drive. The car is zippy, handles very well, and has all the creature comforts anybody would need. Unfortunately I have had to spend a lot of money on this car despite that fact that it is still under warranty. For starters the 3 spoke wheels get bent very easily causing the car to wobble at speeds of over 70mph, the light bulbs need constant replacement, and the battery is very unreliable. If you buy this car make sure you have the warranty otherwise it is going to cost you a lot to keep around. A nice alternative to your run of the mill car."
saab,9-5,2000,NWpilot70, 12/18/2006,Undoubtedly the most unreliable car ever,3,"In the process of researching my new vehicle purchase, I couldn't help but warn potential owners of a Saab 9-5 about the incredible frequency of costly repairs. 1st turbo replacement at 48000 miles, second turbo just blew again at 95000 miles, despite proper unspooling procedures and impeccable maintenance. A myriad of electronic failures that, come to find out, are outrageously common. Including an ABS module replacement for $3000. The display has been pixelated since around 45000 miles. I sent an e-mail of concern to Saab regarding potential recalls to consider and, of course, I received the courtesy reply. In short, I'll never own another Saab! It's awesome when it's running.

Accelerating is a lot of fun; the manual tranny is my favorite part. Inside, the seats are perfect for long trips. Both front and back are heated. In the snow, you are the big dog on the road with a set of Gislaved Nord Frost 3 winter tires. I have had no reliability issues in almost 39,000 miles. At around 60,000 miles I fell asleep and left the road at 60 mph; flew about 35' and came to rest in the ditch. I needed a tow out of the ditch but drove it home and the small dealer I bought it from fixed it up fine. I'm still driving it and, except for the driver's side front floor mat, the car looks and drives as new.  Great car."

We only put 4k miles p/year on it. Once it became my wife's every day car, the problems started ramping up. Lost the serpentine belt 50 miles from home at 14,000 miles. Two water pumps, digital display replaced once, turbo problems. The car is in the shop right now for yet another water pump, that was replaced, yes you guess it, just past the shop warranty of 1 year or 12k miles."

Bad turbo lag, but once it is in the turbo, pretty quick.  Handling is fairly tight, not sportscar tight, but pretty good.  Overall I was happy with this car.  It drove well with very few mechanical problems until just recently, then it seems like everything started to fall apart.  I just sold it for a '99 M3 w/ 50k miles.  I think I am going to notice worlds of difference."
saab,9-5,2000,toxicavenger70, 09/27/2007,Awesome Ride!,4,"This is my second 9-5 wagon but this one is Limited Edition Gary Fisher. Great car but I did do a Saab ECU upgrade and it took all the turbo lag out of it! No slow starts from the light anymore! It is almost like I have it in Sport Mode all the time. Best seats I have ever sat in for a long time and heated seats that don't cook your bottom. Car handles great in our Colorado snow with snowtires (no studs). It did have the standard SID problems, Coolant bypass valve, #6 PVC update and crappy tires. But I get BBA reman. to fix the SID and it has a warranty for 86 bones, PCV update 50 bones and now the car is ready to rock!"
saab,9-5,2000,toxicavenger70, 06/07/2007,Fun Car to DRIVE!,4,"Awesome wagon! I have had a Linear wagon, a Volvo wagon and 3 Subarus. The Gary Fisher is the best one so far! It has the standard turbo lag at first but when it takes off it is good to go. I did have the DIC replaced due to recall and SIDs should be a recall item too. But other than that it is a great car for the price. Also I went back to Subarus for awhile but honestly I missed the comfort of my Saab."
saab,9-5,2000,DCSwede, 09/08/2007,Good and well-balanced car,4,"The Saab's ride-handling balance is a good compromise (somewhat favoring ride quality), and it has good performance and responsiveness (esp. with the sport mode engaged). It's quiet without being Lexus-like and has a very good sound system. The seats are comfortable (though it can be tricky to find a good seating position), and the interior spacious. Respectable highway fuel economy (~25 mpg). Largely reliable (though when needed, repairs/ maintenance is expensive). Overall, it's a very good car, but the base (2.3L turbo) engine provides nearly equal performance and better fuel economy; I'd also recommend buying a car of 2002 model year or later, when a number of improvements were made."
saab,9-5,2000,szthdy, 10/18/2007,Never buying Saab again,3,"Afte having a Saab 900 that ran forever and bought used, I carefully researched wagons and came to the 9-5 purchase expecting good things.  I've had problems with the the theft alarm and various things almost since day 1.  Now, only 7 yrs. old, it needs more repair than it is even worth, and I've waited for tow trucks 4x in less than 2 yrs., not counting prior to that.  I can only expect that reliability has gone down even further.  I got a lemon, and will be glad to soon be rid of it! Cramped rear, flimsy and inconvenient (albeit cool) cupholders.  It is a nice car, all except for the reliability problems."
saab,9-5,2000,Peter, 11/06/2007,Great 8 years!,4,"Our 9-5 has been a really good car. Mainly use it as a winter driver these days, but it is comfortable, quick and very fuel efficient on the highway for the performance the car delivers.  On 6 separate occasions reached over 500 miles (800 kilometres) on a single tank of fuel.    Parts can be expensive, but taking our car to a local ex-Saab mechanic who has his own garage, it's been wonderful.  He immediately is able to diagnosis the situation and supply replacement parts at a price that a regular Saab dealer would not.  Would I purchase a Saab again, absolutely but it has to have the performance, space and efficiency that the 1999-2008 95 has, which I understand is only about a year away."

The car rides like a dream.  I have

I really enjoy the car when it works correctly.  However, it is a very unreliable car.  I was stranded on the side of the road twice - at 60K miles and 65K miles in 2003 (only 2 year old vehicle), both times it was a failed Ignition Cassette causing the Catalytic Converter to melt (very expensive parts).  It is a common problem, the NHTSA Office of Defects is investigating the problem. If you are looking to purchase one of these vehicles, please search Google for ""Saab DI Cassette failure"" for more information about this common problem and consider this when making your decision."

First day my serpentine belt slipped off, dealer had head gasket replaced from before I purchased it and missed that the crank seal was leaking oil too. Alarm batteries are going dead, pulled the fuse to prevent it from going off erratically. A few common problems for 9-5's, but to be expected for a 9 yr old car. Overall I am very pleased with the 9-5, can't wait to be able to purchase a new one. Hope that GM is able to sell Saab back to a Swedish company and not drop the brand altogether, I would be very sad. It's a pretty smart car for a 2001! Gotta love the swede's!"

In the few years I've owned it - and over 30,000 miles later - I've had at least $5,000 worth of work done to it. Around 65,000 it stalled during rush hour. A few years later it started to stall on the freeway - luckily I had enough time to pull off and into a parking lot before it died. The throttle had to be replaced - to the tune of $900, and I've gone through a couple of batteries that all cost over $200. Now I'm facing an oil leak that my mechanic can't seem to find a cap for since Saab isn't making these cars anymore. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems like an awful lot of work for a car still under 100,000 miles."

Replaced the Turbo, ACC control module, trip computer, & entire dash facia at 46K (all warrantied).  Now with 68K miles, have a short in the no. 8 fuse circuit that nobody can find.  Unless I drive with that fuse out, battery dies.  Intermittent engine light due to a faulty coil pack (possibly under recall, but I had to purchase one for my last 9-5.).  Intermittent oil light (replaced the sending unit, but now it looks like a $1K oil pump replacement).  Replaced the left side ACC air dist. stepping motor which controls temp adjust.  Replaced both fog lights.  Needs left side ball joint. Sunroof rattles.  I give up! "
saab,9-5,2001,Richard, 02/22/2016,Don't Bother - These things are money pits,2,"I should have looked further into that price (why does a car with this many nice features and such good driving cost so little) before buying...

The cost for the timing belt, which must be replaced every 80k, is over $1k at the repair shop. If allowed to go to failure, it will destroy the entire V6 engine...  Don't buy one of these with a V6 engine.
I spend, on average, about $2.5k each year just replacing things that break so I can keep my car on the road.  I'm saving to replace it, but I keep draining my savings to fix it so I can get to work again.
I bought mine used.  I've had this particular car now for almost 6 years & 100k miles (bought at 95k miles, now at 195k miles).

Here are the things I've had to replace on my car during that time:
Radiator, Both Radiator Hoses (separate repairs for all 3, one radiator hose failure left me stranded on the side of the road without coolant.)
Ignition coils and spark plugs (that almost left me stranded, I knew they were failing but I had to wait a week for the parts to come in)
Idler pulley (This one was replaced twice, did the first time during the timing belt change at 120k miles, the second one almost stranded me as I saw it bouncing down the road while I was driving to my repair shop).
Water pump (also done during the timing belt, glad I got a 2-for-1 on that one - total cost was $1200 for that repair bill).
Alternator (over $1k for that one, and it took time to come into the 'Saab' specialist shop)
Turbo (That was $2k on its own, ouch!)
Front and rear shocks/strut dampers.
Power steering hoses and reservoir.
Speakers (2 had the foam to fail, I found a speaker repair shop that got them back to working for less than $100 total).
Air Conditioner Controller Motors under the dash, x2. (The first one failed so it was blowing cold during the Winter. The second one failed so it was stuck blowing the defogger onto the windshield during the summer). I did this repair myself. It took a while. I shudder to think what the repair shop would have charged for this one.
I've also had the headlight wipers fail (I removed them) and the sunroof leaks into the vehicle if I'm parked facing down-slope when it rains.  Luckily, my office has a parking garage so I don't deal with that too often.
Also, I cut my finger on the wood veneer peeling off of the dash.  The wood they used was just too thin and the glue fails over time. I'm gradually peeling it off of my dash, it doesn't look good...

Normal Maintenance Items:
Tires (Tires only last ~50k miles, that's the longest I could get out of a set of Michelins. Thank goodness they're only $500 a set)
Brakes (Pads & Rotors once, Pads the 2nd time. This car eats those too).
Oil Pan and Valve Cover gaskets. I still have to get the stains out of my garage.
Fluids (This thing requires Euro spec synthetic motor oil because of the turbo, it's not cheap - about $80 for the shop to do this oil change).
Headlight bulbs only last about 4 months, that's with the long-life version. The 'Silverstar' bulbs only last 4-6 weeks in this car.  These are $20 per pair (for the long-life version).

About 'Onstar' - The onstar system they put in my car is completely obsolete. It will not connect to anything now.  I removed the Onstar from my car.


2018 Update - New in the 2 years since my last review: 
Replaced the shifter linkage connection bushing at the transmission.  There's a nylon bushing between the end of the shifter cable and the shift linkage on the transmission.  That apparently fails with age and when it does, you're stuck in whatever gear you were in when it broke.  Fortunately, the part was $5 at Advance or Auto Zone and I was in my driveway when it failed.  If your shifter thinks it needs to be pulled from D to 3 to get the dash display to move from N to D, then it's about to die - you should drive to somewhere flat that you can park and fix this. 
Fuel Pump & rear
 gate lifters.
Replaced Key Controller Module - When this failed (because water was getting into the sunroof and it collected around this module that sits at the low point of the car below the driver seat), the key no longer did anything EXCEPT unlock the drivers door.  Turning the key in the ignition would turn on accessory power, but nothing else would happen because this module tells the computer if the key is valid, not the key pattern in the lock cylinder.
The speakers in the rear doors no longer work so I've got a functional rear subwoofer, but no other sound except for the dashboard speakers.
The battery died - that should have been expected.  It was old (first time replacing that in 6 years, which is about average for a good battery).
The turbo that I replaced is now smoking heavily again on startup (as long as there's oil above the fill line on the dipstick, which is another question, but I think the turbo is the source of the leak).
Also need to replace the Alternator again.
I'm not going to do the turbo or the alternator this time. It's time to cut my losses.

It has been a great dog mobile and triathlon equipment car.
I have a love/hate relationship with the Turbo.
It has gone once already as has the battery, brakes, cup holder, lights (frequently), electric panel, A/C, etc.
I have easily spent over $10k in repairs.
The ignition is in a terrible place and the car has turned off when a larger person passenger accidentally bumped the ignition.
I thought it was a lemon but from reading other reviews this is typical of this model.
I had hoped to drive it forever but I don't think it will last that long. The interior is nice but I won't buy a performance vehicle again."

My 9-5 Aero automatic usually performs flawlessly inside and out, but the heat has brought odd and annoying electrical problems:
There is a ""bing-bong"" noise that let's you know when there is a problem, which would be helpful if it didn't do it every minute or two; the gas gage fluctuates from completely empty back to the accurate reading while the TSC/off light is on despite pushing the button, and I have replaced the same headlight three times this year.
I love the car though.
I drove to NYC and was able to get 31.0 mpg, which is incredible with 230 bhp."

So, I looked at Audi, BMW, MB, and Saab

my wife and I prefer manual

The Saab Aero wagon is the most fun to

A discernable turbo lag -- though kick into sport mode transmission and it's WOW, even on base model. Nice car, hope it lasts. DO get a CPO warranty for protection - dealer told me it's $1,200 of the $16,000 price I paid, and definately insurance worth having until 100,000 miles. "

On the downside, the center digital instrument display always had problems with dead pixels.  Had it replaced and same problem.  Over the years just had to replace the alternator once, and the HVAC controls go nuts sometimes and throws out heat on the drive side when the AC is blowing from other ducts.  Otherwise it drives smoother than my 2015 Honda CRV which is bumpy and full of air leaks.

I feel like I'm driving on eggshells as this thing bounces all over the road when hitting normal highway bumps in the road. Dealership says shocks are fine.  The placement of ignition has got to be the most unsafe place any designer could have chosen.  Too many little and big things have gone wrong with this vehicle.

Gas guage stuck, lights dying frequently, sway bar, turbo replacement, ball bearings. That doesn't count the things that have broken that I haven't bothered to fix: broken cupholder, elect memory seat adjustment, theft-alarm battery. I know the Saab dealer serves great coffee but I've been there too much and now it is time to switch to a car that spend more time on the road and less in the shop.

Oil leak, timing belt pulley, water pump, gas line recall, turbo, wouldn't start when the seasons changed, hatchback handle, drivers side window, passenger window, broken shift cover, seriously too many to list. And the cost to fix is way more than anything I've ever owned!  It was love at first drive, but I cross my fingers every time I go to start it, and every time I hear a rattle.   I'm far too friendly with my local mechanic.  He knows my voice when I call on the telephone before I even identify myself.  Do not be lured in by the fun ride!"

average. The 9-5 is a complete tank in 
the snow, very sure footed. This is the 
first vehicle I feel safe in. After 
visiting a salvage yard and seeing 
wrecked SAABs, I know the car will 
protect me almost better than anything 
on the market. Some 9-5s have had 
problems, mine however has been 
absolutely problem free for over 28,000 
miles. Coming from a person who keeps 
cars for 2 years or less, I hope to 
have this one for at least 200,000 
miles. Good warranty."

I think this car is the best value out 
there for a used, low mileage car. I've 
driven it 4500 miles with no problems.I 
like the fact that you don't see a lot 
of them on the road. (Have you noticed 
how many BMWs are on the road! 
Everybody and their brother has one!)I 
highly recommend buying buying a low 
mileage 2001 9-5. I think the 1999's 
have to many problems, that was the 
first year."

heated rear seats a bonus for the

The 9-5 is a much stronger car overall and even gets better gas mileage.  We still have an '00 Volvo V70 XC wagon that my wife likes, but I find it inferior to the 9-5 in all respects from economy to acceleration + the 9-5 has a WB radio and gets better reception on the AM band to boot! Yes, I do have snow tires (Gislaved Nordfrosts) on the 9-5 and it is the equal of the AWD V70 (and we have a hilly, curvy 1/3-mile-long driveway!) during our winters. "
saab,9-5,2001,Mick, 01/13/2005,9-5 Aero a Blast to Drive,4,"I've got to say the 9-5 Aero is the most fun to drive vehicle I've owned, and I've had many over the past 20+ years, including a BMW 525i that comes in second to this SAAB. The power is phenomenal, the handling awesome, the ride on the highway is silky smooth.  I like how the computer compensates for any type of gas you put in from  regular to super.  The back seats are comfortable even for a 6-footer, and the passengers back there appreciate the heated seats.  Exterior styling is good, but needs an update--the new 9-3 is better looking.  For $14,900 I think I got a real bargain here-- wouldn't want to buy a new one at $40K with that kind of depreciation in 3 years though! "

this used Saab. I couldn't be happier. 
The overall quality and solidity of 
this wagon makes the VW seem like an 
old minibus. 
The engine is so powerful and smooth; 
the ride so good and the handling is 
very good especially for a wagon.
The interior is very comfortable and 
the seats are great. 
I get 30 MPG on the highway and 26-27 
overall.
This car is certainly worth a look.

turbo at 20K miles; dealership fixed 
it under warranty and didn't cost me a

saab,9-5,2001,oddity2, 12/28/2003,Pretty nice car if you don't pay retail,4,"My second Saab and a step up from the 
9-3 with manual 5-speed. The interior is 
roomier and more thoughtfully designed and 
the exterior design is much more attractive 
than the 9-3, which resembles a cockroach. 

I chose the V6 because of turbo lag with the 
4-banger. The V6 is quick, especially in sport 
mode. It cruises effortlessly at supralegal 
speeds. On regular gas it gets 22 mpg in 
mixed city driving, rising to 32 mpg on the 
freeway.

The car was a sweet lease deal; various 
incentives brought the cap cost $8500 
below MSRP. Having driven the car for 2.5 
years though, I really think of it as a $32K car."

comfortable. The sport mode of the 95 
saab is a real nice kick when you hit 
the gas and is a considerable step up 
from the normal mode. The cup holders 
are a negative but with the long list 
of standard features, it more than 
makes up for it. Also OnStar is nice 
to have if your willing to pay the 
extra $120-$300 a year. I would get 
the 3 liter because there is more than 
enough power and isn't as noisy as my 
friend's aero version."

day one.  Very smooth and quick - 
especially highway driving.  Great

engineered and built automobile.  This 
is probably the first and the last Saab 
I'll ever buy.  GM is in the process of 
destroying this brand, as far as I am 
concerned.  Back to the car:  the Sport

Audi, Infiniti, Acura, Lexus before deciding on the 
Saab 9-5 Aero. Only competitor for sheer fun to 
drive was the BMW 3 series, but that car was much 
smaller with poor rear seat and trunk space. After 
28,000 miles, the 9-5 has been reliable, still feels 
rock solid, safe and roomy enough for kids, handles 
beautifully and oh, that turbo kick that presses you 
back into your seat! Nits: 1. the bumpers are poorly 
designed--if you get a few scratches on the black 
ribbon in the middle, you have to replace the whole 
thing. 2. Road noise is greater than it should be for 
a car in this range, especially on concrete highways "
saab,9-5,2001,r34, 09/24/2004,I enjoy my driving,4,"My 01 9-3 was hit by a big truck on a 
highway. My wife was driving it and 
walked out ok. We decided to trade a 
little bit of reliability (not buying a 
Japanese car) with driving pleasure 
(buying an European car). We decided to 
get a certified Saab (you need it). The 
dealer didn't do the certification very 
well and we had to get them fix certain 
minor things. Overall the car is more 
responsive than my 9-3 and the interior 
is much better. It is more like a 
luxury sedan than the 9-3. We want to 
be there all the time, even sitting in 
the car doing nothing Now we 
cannot ""escape"" from Saab."

drivng it off the lot, the car has
performed flawlessly.  I don't ask much
of the vehicle, but it does everything I
need it to.  In its first 15,000, I
drove lots of stop and go.  Now, its
smooth sailing every day.  In both
situations, the car has been happy and
so have I, except for the traffic. 
Maintenance has been limited.  The only
surprise has been brakes - but I suppose
this is due more to the stop and go
traffic rather than the components.  Out
here where it gets hot in the summer
(not as hot as Arizona or Nevada, but
hot nonetheless) the lenses on the
headlights developed cracks and were
replaced without questions.  A solid
performer."

It handles very vell and is comfortable to sit in for longer trips. There is so much power in this thing you can toy around traffic with all the power you want and precision steering. 
saab,9-5,2001,grocerygetter, 03/07/2005,Love it!,5,"Love my car. Love it so much. The manual transmission is a blast to drive, especially downshifting to 4th to kick in that turbo. Sturdy and safe and comfy for me (5'4) and hubby (6'2) and our family. We couldn't be happier!"
saab,9-5,2001,Paul in PA, 06/09/2005,My fifth Saab,4,"Another great Saab. Lots of room for camping and a comfortable ride. My gas mileage was 32 driving to South Carolina with the AC on full time (5-speed manual.) Just like a tank in the snow with four snow tires, of course. Just won a People's Choice award at Saabs in Carlisle at the Carlisle Import/Replicar show in May, so the looks are great."
saab,9-5,2001,Scott, 07/16/2005,Last Saab Owner,3,"Great car to drive but when it runs. Without a doubt the least dependable car I've ever owned (including a Chevette in college).  52,000 miles and I've replaced the turbo twice, two oil leaks, digital dash display and the front left wheel bearing. Now, it won't start-jury still out as to why. I bought this car $12k under MSRP new and 3 years into a 5 year note I'm still $3k upside down.  It seems many people know not to buy this car reflected by its resale, or lack there of.  Maybe it's the 6-cyl as Saab quite making it.  My Saab experience has been unbelievably poor to say the least. RUN!"
saab,9-5,2001,8AA2YM, 11/15/2005,Saab Reality,4,"This was my second Saab. It was great to drive, and my dealership treated me like a king. Things started going wrong with the V-6 in this car, though. I began to notice a degradation in engine performance at about 42K miles. I had it in the shop at 48K when I decided to trade it in. In any case, My 3 Saabs have required little unscheduled maintenance other than many fog light lens replacements."

Great acceleration at any speed, superb handling, and amazing comfort!  I've been up to 154 mph (German Autobahn) in this machine - what a rush!  Only one bad stretch during my ownership - right after the warranty expired (4/50,000), I put about $3k into repairs (both CV joints/boots and front main oil leak), but otherwise it's been the model of reliability.  Expensive to maintain and hard to find someone to work on it, I wouldn't buy another one here in the U.S., but I hope to drive this one forever."
saab,9-5,2001,pkelly944, 02/10/2007,Awful build,3,"The car has its upsides: good performance out at the 2.3 w/ the turbo. Brakes well. On the downside: With 80,500 miles, head gasket, oil change never missed. Always has blown blue smoke occasionally, interior electronics fail, headlights burn out monthly. Horrible wiring system. All small things break. Air bag light on for no reason. Has had two tune up under warranty with no resolve for the smoke. Power steering lines replaced. Never would recommend."

everyone oil change.  I asked so what 
happens if the motor blows up are you 
going to stand behind me:  they said 
nope based on the fact that i don't

be a real sob story as far as quality 
went and repairs in this area (San

dealership has changed and it is 
great.  We get a new SAAB as a loaner 
any time we take it in! Free 
maintenance for 45,000 is a plus since 
my 3 year lease @15,000 miles per year

in the 30 - 50, or even 50 - 75 range. 
This car flies! It has tremendous

No ""turbo-lag"". This car is smooth,

If you own one of these, I highly suggest joining an online Saab forum to educate yourself even further....and to save $$. Like any European make, they can be a bit high maintenance. That's why a lot of Saab owners are DIYers or have a well trusted mechanic programmed in their speed dial.

It is mandatory to use synthetic oil in turbo models, and I wouldn't buy any used Saab without interrogating the previous owner about their maintenance schedule until they wept aloud."

There's no comparison-PLUSH seats, quieter ride, better looks, and Ohhhhh that pavement hungry engine! I can't begin to count the number of friends who own all those overpriced German cars who take a ride in mine get out saying, ""WOW!"" Need I say more?

Solid performance, sticks to the road nicely -- I love the Michelin Pilot Sport tires (just bought another set for it).  I've had only one bad experience with my car (related to a recall on the headlamp assemblies that was not completed correctly - some difficulty with a dealer - but the factory eventually responded to my call and took care of the issue."
saab,9-5,2002,alex205, 10/04/2014,2002 Saab 9-5 linear,3,"They are brilliant cars if you maintain them well!
one of the 2 things that let you down is the Ignition coil which needs to be replace every 7-9 year of normal driving. And the other thing is the water pump that need to be replaced every 10 years or it will break and jam the timing belt and stop your engine.
after 8-10 years you will notice a small oil leakage its okay dont worry its the head gasket thats all but you must fi it as soon as possible cause the oil might catch fire!
Saabs run better in cold weather than middle east countries!"
saab,9-5,2002,Saab BT, 09/17/2010,Great Car!,4,"I bought the car in pristine condition from a dealership specializing in pre owned saabs and volvos.  The car was a steal at the price I paid.  Smooth turbo, comfortable seats, great on the highway.  Right off the bat I needed some minor work done, but luckily I found a mechanic that works on..you guessed it, saabs and volvos! I feel more secure having found him. The only issue so far is a whining noise at low speed;  we (the mechanic and I) think it's an issue with the brakes where something is rubbing or perhaps the turbo is making the noise at low speed.  Other than that, the car (knock on wood) has been terrific so far."
saab,9-5,2002,bobrunn, 02/22/2006,Mixed emotion,4,"I really enjoy driving and looking at my Saab.  This is the 3rd Saab I've had and they all have the same characteristics--fun to drive, very many safety features, great versatility, but many mechanical problems. I have 103,000 miles and I've had to replace the brakes twice, replaced the head gasket, bad thermostat, computerized problems that I don't understand. "
saab,9-5,2002,jzeilinger, 09/30/2008,The 9-5's Evil Twin,4,"Is my 2nd 9-5 and without a doubt, the Aero is the way to go. The amount of power this 4 cylinder has is amazing & the cornering with the low profile perf. tires is tenacious. Everyone who rides in this car is extremely surprised by the ""giddy up"" & handling. It's definitely a vehicle I enjoy driving and doing 30k miles/yr for business that's an important requirement, I practically live in my car during the business week. There's a host of creature comforts in the interior and I've never gotten fatigued behind the wheel, even on 4+ hr business trips-very comfortable seats that seem to wrap right around you. . "
saab,9-5,2002,otto, 10/17/2010,Done with Saabs,3,Read just a sample listing of some of the mechanical and electronic issues people have had and that has been my experience and then some. The most recent and the last episode with any Saab product was the turbo. Done. This car was constantly in the garage. No mas.
saab,9-5,2002,Charlie, 08/20/2008,A Unique Blend of Virtues,4,"This is a great all-around family vehicle, with something for everyone. It's got great interior space, attractive exterior appearance, exciting turbo performance, economical gas mileage, and reasonable mechanical reliability.    "
saab,9-5,2002,chris, 09/11/2008,Great car!,4,"This is my first Saab but I am hooked. I bought it on Dec 30 2007 and have not had any issues. You cannot beat the price for the amount of car. I live in northern KY in an area that is saturated with Chevy Impalas, Toyota Camrys, and Honda Accords. I love the uniqueness of the Saab. Great performance and decent fuel mileage along with excellent build quality are my favorite aspects. My only complaint is the pixelated LED display which should be a recall since it is apparently so common. I would recommend this car to anyone in need of a 4door sedan."
saab,9-5,2002,Saad, 01/26/2009,Stay away!,3,"I loved this car when I first bought it. Thought I got a good deal and luckily got the extended warranty. It was fine for the the first few months but since then it has been in the shop every 2-3 months. Turbo went, alternator went, multiple sensors, etc. Driving on the highway last week, the passenger turning signal assembly flew off the car! Worst car I ever bought. Will never buy another Saab. "
saab,9-5,2002,oforibk1, 03/05/2002,Fun Toy,4,"Exhillarating (yet quiet) 4 CYL.  Sport button coverts this into a fun toy.    Build quality could be improved (cheap looking heated seat controls and open/close vent thingys).
Stereo is very good.  For a car build for Northern Europe, it handles quite lousily in snow.  The winter setting doesn't actually do a whole lot of good.  Certainly would not recommend it as an only car if snow and hills feature in your life."
saab,9-5,2002,JAM, 10/05/2007,Solid car,4,"I've owned my 9-5 for 3.5 years. Bought from a local coming off lease. I've put approximately 90k miles on and am amazed at the mileage I get (mostly highway driving) I average 32- 34 highway depending on A/C needs. This car is quiet, comfortable, and somewhat fun to drive. It handles well but isn't a sportscar. It accelerates well especially in sport mode, but won't slap you in you seat. I bought a Maxima and it sits in the garage while I half heartedly attempt to sell this car - that should tell you something. The total package is well done if not overly exciting in any one area."
saab,9-5,2002,nate, 07/05/2007,2002 Saab 9-5 Aero review,4,"I have owned Saabs my entire life, this being the first ""GM"" saab.  I am pleasantly surprised with the ride/seat comfort on long trips.  The handling on the Aero is much better than that of a standard 9-5 turbo that I have driven. And the sound system is amazing. Only thing I do not like is the small amount of storage space.  Overall, I am very happy with the car."
saab,9-5,2002,bar_ml, 01/01/2009,"OK, but not really happy",3,"I bought this in mint condition last spring.  I have put about 20K on it.  Driving on the highway is great, especially here in Europe.  But, this car is starting to drive me nuts.  1 cup holder, no armrests, waywayway too many buttons for the heater, etc.  Give me some dials so I can concentrate on driving and not have to search for a button and almost wreck.  They key should be on the steering column.  That's where my cell, wallet etc. go.  Give me wipers that I can set where I want, not some electronic sensor.  Always too fast or too slow for me.  Display constantly missing pixels.  reverse help never works.  Key batteries die very fast.  I have had no engine/tranny problems."
saab,9-5,2002,Dan Munteanu, 07/07/2009,The car that makes me happy,5,"Saab 9-5 Aero is a car that does everything very well that you'd expect from a near luxury vehicle. On top of it, the extra oomph can be effortlessly delivered by just pressing the gas pedal harder. The manual transmission might be a little tricky to master for some at first, but I was able to read it right away and I still enjoy using it. If they're brand new they may be a tad expensive but it makes a great slightly used car at a great price.         "
saab,9-5,2002,bcrzmon, 02/21/2010,All good but for the little glitches,4,"My wife bought this car on ebay.  I was initially skeptical and nervous about the higher cost of repair, but this car is very fun to drive and the swedish styling and lux features are hard to beat (especially for the price).  The repair bills can be a bit high, but normal for this class.  Nothing major has gone wrong though and I can live with a broken sunroof, no backup alarm battery, the cup holder issue, 1 busted seat heater cause ultimately I really like being in this car."
saab,9-5,2002,dave , 02/16/2008,Great car!!!,5,"My 02 Aero has 95k miles and still drives and looks like new! Saabs do require some extra care in terms of maintenance and do have some glitches, but no serious defects. The car is a blast to drive, handles great, has great steering and all that power and pickup, even at highway speeds!!! Still get great gas mileage. Smooth and quiet ride like no other car with similar performance. The interior is as good and even better than most luxury brands, it has the best seats I've ever sat in! It is also one of the few cars remaining that has a distinctive look."
saab,9-5,2002,Bonday, 03/01/2002,beat the crowd,5,"My wife and i have driven the car for the past 3 months and put 5k on the car. Having driven Volvos for the past 16 years, I found the Saab extremely satisfying with its no nonsense interior design, power and functionality. Having driven Maxima's in past, this car is by far the most favarite so far. We hope that it lasts as long as. Prior to purchase, we also test drove extensively Volvo S80 and V70 turbo. Deciding on this Saab was a no brainer"
saab,9-5,2002,Saabboy, 09/04/2003,Super Saab,4,"Bought the 9 5 Arc w/ touring package 
at used w/ 4,800 miles.  only 28K.  
Outstanding car.  Love the sport mode 
and sound system.  Trunk space is a 
huge plus.  Plenty of room throughout.  
Great standard features and w/ two kids 
under 5, safety should always be 
considered."
saab,9-5,2002,Jim , 01/11/2005,Give me back my 9-3,2,"In the last 18 months this car has been in the shop 45 days. Transmission hesitates and dogs out, sunroof fixed four times, engine light continues to come on, climate control blows cold air in the front seat and hot air in the back seat, driver's door handle fell off, two climate vents fell apart, air conditioning can't stand up to a California summer. Saab won't stand behind their product and we're stuck with an unreliable car. In six months have gone from BEING Saab's #1 fan to vowing to never buy another. Just crossed the 9-7x off my list."
saab,9-5,2002,tedsmith944, 02/11/2005,Fast comfortable sedan,4,"Just bought this 2002 Saab 9-5 Aero sedan.  Went with the 5-speed manual.  This car is very, very fast at cruising speeds and is the perfect highway passing vehicle.  Torque steer and turbo lag are noticeable when driving around town.  I really like the Xenons as this is my first car with that type of lighting.  As an engineer, I am attracted to the engine technology; 250hp/258lb-ft is mighty impressive from 2.3 liters of displacement.  Furthermore, the engine management and gearing allow me to get great gas mileage.  Also, I wanted something that you don't see everyday, so the Saab is way cooler than a 330i (for example) in that respect.  Overall, I am very happy."
saab,9-5,2002,Dublj, 06/02/2005,What a Ride!,4,"I bought this car one month ago and have had a superior experience so far.  My concern with imports such as this is repair cost, and Saab has covered that with a 100,000 mile/3 year warranty.  One test drive and I was hooked.  This car can move - 250 horses never felt so good - there is a lag in the turbo, but in sport mode that is taken care of for the most part.  Ride is smooth and as safe as they come.  Seats are ultra comfortable.  My only regret is having waited so long to take the plunge with this vehicle.  Price is right especially compared to others in this ""class"", with none of the repair concerns because of the warranty, which does not cost more like it does for the Maxima."
saab,9-5,2002,kdmmat, 01/02/2004,fantastic car,5,"Best luxury car for the money. This car 
is a blast to drive. Have not had to 
take it back to the dealership for any 
problems after a year of driving. The 
car still amazes me every time I drive 
it. The turbo is incredible, the gas 
mileage fantastic, and those seats are 
so comfortable. This car corners like 
it is on rails. I had a BMW 7 series 
try to stay up with me on a on ramp to 
the freeway: I flat blew him away. The 
passing acceleration is among the best 
of any car that I have ever driven."
saab,9-5,2002,Albany Speeder, 11/22/2005,Great Certified Value,4,"Just had the car a few days - and look forward to driving it everytime I have the chance.  The interior is wonderfully done - comfortable, but sporty.  When the car is in ""Sport"" mode - it can run with any car on the highay - bar none.  In normal mode - it's almost too tame, but I guess that's how you get 30 mpg and 250 hp in the same package.  The car is certainly a beautiful car to behold - great shape and wonderfully engineered styling.  When coupled with the interior - it's a great all around package.   The best part is probably the fact you can get a certified luxury car, (to 100K), for under $20K.  A great buy."
saab,9-5,2002,Chris The Saab Lover, 01/29/2004,The Best In The Business,5,"When My 15 year old son was about to 
turn 16 we decided to go out and do a 
little car shopping.  I Used to have 
a '92 900 16 valve 5-speed and it could 
blow any car out of the water.  Well 
while we were out shopping my son 
reminded me about my old Saab and so we 
decided to go and check one out.  When 
she showed up to the lot we both fell 
in love with an '02 silver 9-5 Aero.  
Ever since I got that car for him I 
never see him anymore because he is 
always out driving he loves how the car 
handles.  I have an '01 Jaguar S-type 
and whenever I can, I try and steal the 
9-5 from my son because it is so much 
fun to drive."
saab,9-5,2002,SaabOwnerEd, 02/15/2004,My 26th Saab - - 2002 9-5 Aero,5,"I have owned 27 Saabs and with 5 on 
hand.  The 2002 9-5 Aero is the best 
that I have owned.  Compared to 
competing models from Volvo, Audi, 
BMW, ... price is a deal.

Key is to find a dealer that you can 
trust for service because Saabs are 
not inexpensive to maintain.

Saab has no sense of customer loyalty.  
I get the same $500 Customer Loyalty 
rebate as a one Saab owner.  Saab is 
arrogant and only thinking about the 
next sale - - no regard for the 
existing customer."
saab,9-5,2002,Keith - Michigan, 03/08/2004,first Saab,5,"Had not intent to buy a Saab. Took the 
95 for a ride and that was it. Very

performance of the turbo. Would 
recommend one to anyone."
saab,9-5,2002,maltesefalcon, 03/11/2004,Most underrated car?,5,"I've had my Saab 9-5 Aero for 21 months 
now.  I bought it because it had the 
best combination of everything I was 
looking for.  Where can you get really 
good performance yet get 32 MPG on the 
highway.  The trunk is huge and 
handling is great too.  And with the 
onstar system, you get a built in 
phone.  Just push the button and start 
talking, hands free.  I've surprised a 
lot of people sitting at a stoplight.  
I just punch in the sport mode and this 
thing takes off like a rocket from a 
standstill.  I've had no problems or 
repairs so far.  Which leads me to 
conclude that this is one of the most,
(if not the most) underrated cars for 
sale today.  "

black beauty, love at first sight.  I 
get compliments on its appearance all 
the time.  Whether on the turnpike or 
winding roads or in town, it never 
fails to delight.  Its price is a 
bargain, compared to its competition."

Some say that the turbo is not quick enough well for me, it is plenty quick.  I know because the aggressive driving on german road. The ride is very smooth.  The gas mileage is great and I am sure it would get better if I slowed down."
saab,9-5,2002,bacdoc, 12/26/2006,9-5 Aero,5,"Traded in my 2000 A6 after a year of staring at the check engine light. I previously owned a 2001 9-5 v6 which I enjoyed, I like this a lot more. Overall best bang for the buck, fast, comfortable, nice ride, and good gas mileage. I recently took it on a 2000 mi trip, at 70-75 mph I averaged 32.5 mpg!! I always look foward to driving this car."

saab,9-5,2002,jzeilinger, 11/16/2008,"I Laughed, I cried, It Moved Me",4,"This has to be the craziest love/hate relationship I've ever had with a car. One day I hated it, the next day I loved it. This car has a ton of power for a 4-banger and it was a total hoot to drive. It handled corners extremely well with very little body lean, was incredibly quick, roomy, huge trunk, responsive, and got very good gas mileage for a car of this size. I enjoyed this car tremendously. This was my 2nd 9-5 so that tells you something about my love for car. The Aero is pavement hungry & the conservative sport sedan look is very deceptive - cop magnet, be careful!"

a blast to drive since I bought it as

whatsoever.  The trunk is not quite as 
cavernous as my previous 9000

Visited dealer, drove 2001 Aero, was thunderstruck.  
Soon, 02 Arc arrived, w/ 5sp Auto, upgraded suspension, was hooked. 
Saab had 02 Preview Promo with dealer cash, good price on trade, took the plunge.
After 1500 miles, I love this car, excellent dealer service. 
Drives great. Handling composed; quiet at speed, 26MPG freeway, and goes from 50 to 100mph in a snap!
Safe, incl. 3yrs maint. Worry-free."

saab,9-5,2002,spidaman, 07/07/2006,End of the Road,4,"After 4 yrs with this car, finally turned the lease in to buy a 9-3 convertible @ 0% financing.  My long term impression of this car was quite good.  In fact, I had intended to buy this car at the end of lease when the 0% deal came up.  There was a small leak in the sunroof from a poor seal when I first bought the car, fixed under warranty.  After that, only required routine maintance over 61K miles.  Most reliable car I have ever owned over 4 years.  The  185 hp sometimes made me wince, and strained at times merging onto highway, but putting in sport mode usually solved all problems.  Was excellent in the snow with all-season tires.  Never bought the snows, although I live in MN"

Still too much torgue steer and I found the seats a little uncomfortable with no natural place to rest my arms while driving.  But this car is greatly improved over the 2001 Aero.
saab,9-5,2002,DaDrain, 04/03/2002,Saab Aero,5,"This car glides!  Goes 60 to 100 in a blink and you feel like you cruising at 40 on a newly paved road.  Impressive acceleration and handling.  I had an Acura TL-s which was a nice car and fast as hell, but the ride was subpar.  Traded it in for the Saab and now know what it means to drive a true car.

The downside?  The car doesn't come with a CD changer.  The Acura comes with an in dash 6 CD changer.  So does the Lincoln LS.  Also, if you do plan on playing CDs the storage space for the jewel cases are pathetic.  Saab needs to address the CD changer, storage space, and add automatic-up window controls.

Maybe I'm just picky.  I know, shut and drive!"

My 3rd Saab(from: 900, 9-3SE, now '02 9- 5Linear) and have been very happy most especially the 9-5. Great space (hauled a love seat), lots of standard features that are still optional in some cars 6yrs later (side airbags, ESP, 5-spd auto tran, glovebox cooler, Trip-comp, dual sun-visors, Harmon-Kardon etc.) Safe - a fist-sized rock hit windshield 2x/2occasions and only a small chip, rear-ended by an Explorer and no damage (Explorer bumpers bent and caved-in). Great in long-drives, very peppy and quite! The Aero would have been exhilirating. Plan 2 keep it until 1M miles!"

Wanted to love this car but it has been in the shop more than any other car I have owned, 7 or 8 times in the 2 1/2 years I have owned her. The interior could use an update, but the seats are super comfy. I really like the exterior of the car, looks fast standing still.  Gas mileage in town is poor for a 4 cyl., only about 17 mpg due to the turbo but hwy mileage is surprisingly good at about 31 mpg. Just too many little things.  Warranty ran out in Sept. and just today I spent $1800 on repairs and the 60,000 mile service. Sad to say she will probably get traded in soon."

male and I dive a wagon!. I traded my 
GMC Jimmy in for the SAAB because I 
wanted something more luxurious that 
was sporty, good on gas and could haul 
my stuff from HomeDepot. I got it all 
and in a very sexy (at least I think so)
package.

The car had a few issues when I picked 
it up but they all were taken car of in 
a prompt manner by the service 
department. I would give the service 
department an excellent rating and the 
sales department a moderate rating. My 
sales man was not well informed about 
the cars features and suggested I try 
things out to see if they worked. 

I hope the car proves to be reliable."

closer than anything available for

was superior.  The Infinity's sport 
suspenders were too stiff and standard 
was too soft.  The Aero was in between,

Nissan with only 200HP and get this..

The sticker read $39K (SAAB incentives 
lowered it to $34K) and it is screwed 
together better than my father's Lexus 
430LS...

Saab.....way to go. The best car I have 
ever owned."
saab,9-5,2002,SAAB Driver, 08/03/2009,Saab 95 2002 4dr 2.3t,5,"Beautiful Car! I got this car and it needed a few minor check ups, that cost me around $200, but after all I'm buying a used car, i actually had in mind a little more than that! :) the car has GREAT performance, and I'm loving it, its classy and sexy at the same time!"
saab,9-5,2002,SEELOS, 06/14/2002,Saab 9-5 SE 6 cylinder,4,"Having owed only SAABs for the last 10 
years, we have seen the good and the 
bad.  This 2001 9-5 SE with heated and 
ventilated seats is the best so far.The 
turbo performance has great 
acceleration, especially in the sport 
mode.  The ventilated seats are great 
when the weather is hot and have to be 
turned down because one starts to get 
the chills.  In winter, the heated 
heats are almost always on. When my 
wife drives our 2000 9-3 SE SAAB she 
never turns the heated seats off.  The 
only thing that could be better could 
be the legroom in the rear seats.  ."
saab,9-5,2002,Jon Walgren, 06/22/2002,Had one in '73.,4,"Drove one, rental vehicle in Sverige  
(Sweden) in 2000.  Had a stick.  Drove 
2,000 US miles in Sweden.

Loved the car.

And this 2002 9-5 Aero is so much nicer.
Buy/lease it.
No, I dont't work for Saab/GM.

Go for it.  You get LOTS for LESS."
saab,9-5,2002,bluejay, 05/22/2010,Tired,3,"This has been a good family, well maintained, gently driven car with some surprising expenses-new turbocharger 3 yrs ago, quirky starting, and annoying LED display failure that would cost $500 to replace.  It handles well and the lack of pep is offset by reasonably good gas mileage20/30+ on trips.  Not sure I will get another due to the change of ownership and increased quality issues with newer models identified by Consumer Reports."
saab,9-5,2002,chiroprincess, 07/09/2010,Black Turbo Powered Beauty,4,"This car is FAST for a wagon and SAFE. It's a very sturdy, solid car being quite able to zip up a steep hill without a problem. I also love the design. Several times strangers on the street have commented to me how 'good looking' this car is! I'm also impressed how roomy the back is. I can get my large bike right in w/ the back seats down. I also like the low profile of the rear 'floor' easy to get things (including our dog) in & out. I have had some oil leak problems and several hoses that have gone bad in the past few years, but considering it is now 8 yrs old not too bad in repair terms. I just test drove a '04 Volvo wagon  and I have to say that I still like my Saab way more!"
saab,9-5,2002,Dan_Pat, 06/29/2002,2002 Linear 9-5 is amazing !,4,"This car is a HUGE value right now 
as everybody is paying way too much 
for the Audi A4.   After driving both the 
only advantage the Audi has is in the 
4WD  + Good luck buying an Audi 
with Onstar unless you wish to drop 
5K on options and wait until the fall. I 
was about to wait and pay the 
premium when I saw a Saab 9-5 , 
test drove it and within 5 days was 
looking at a bill of sale. 

This is a great time to buy a Saab   
remember to knock off 3K under the 
invoice as the dealers are getting 
cash back. ( one dealer in 
Connecticut would not admit to this 
and quoted me a higher price  
pocketing the cash back - what a jerk 
:)."
saab,9-5,2002,SaabGuy, 07/26/2002,Outstanding Car!!!,5,"This car is a dream to drive.   I've driven the I35, G35, 330, and the A4, and 
the 9-5 Aero blows them all away.   The ride is smooth, yet the power is 
there when you need it!   I'd recommend everyone test drive one if you're 
considering a sport/luxury car."
saab,9-5,2002,Copa, 07/31/2002,Nothing But Praise,4,"Excellent Car.  If you want a good 
size wagon with great performance, 
the Saab Aero is it.  Bigger than the 
540 wagon and much less than 
either the BMW or Audi.  The best 
bang for the buck."
saab,9-5,2002,Mboya, 08/13/2002,A Pleasant Surprise,5,"I was recently in the market for a new 
car and primarily limited my search to 
the well known top performers: Acura, 
BMW and Lexus.  After thinking I had 
narrowed my search, I came across the 
Saab 9-5 and never looked anywhere 
else.  It is truly an amazing 
automobile.  I have the 2.3t (manual 
transmission) which has more luxury 
features then any of the aforementioned 
vehicles in its class, it's got great 
acceleration and with On-Starm, you 
can't go wrong.  Most people I know had 
never seen one, but now everywhere I 
go, it captivates on-lookers."
saab,9-5,2002,fedomg, 08/18/2002,No justice for one of the finests cars..,4,"When the test drive of the Aero 
here in Mexico no vendor was at the 
time and one of the mechanics came 
with me. We both were atonished. 
Acceleration is incredible, handling 
in curves is equal to none and the 
ride quality, even with the tunned 
suspension, is absolut comfort. Also 
tested the 330iA. Just 
said, ""..thanks, but I will have the 
Saab"". Not many 9-5 (neither 9-3's) 
can be seen in Mexico, so this is 
realy a head turner. BMW's are now in 
every corner. What most impreses me is 
that Saab was not even in my third 
choice (also considered the A4 and 
Volvo S60) and almost 
got unnoticed, if not given the advise 
to test drive it by a friend."
saab,9-5,2002,RMP, 08/19/2002,Best Wagon Value,4,"My wife and I compared the Volvo V70 
and Passat GLX to the Saab. The Saab 
was the clear winner. Exterior looks 
aside, this vehicle was by far the most 
bang for the buck. After the dealership 
took $7,000 off the sticker it was a no 
brainer. It even looks pretty good in 
midnight blue.  It's sportier than the 
Volvo and more distinctive than the 
Passat. The interior is top notch."
saab,9-5,2002,Jacques Talbot, 08/19/2002,very impressive,5,"Excellent performance,and superb 
stability"
saab,9-5,2002,bRAD, 08/20/2002,Sports car with a patio!,4,"I wanted a sports car and I wanted a 
car to haul around all my stuff like 
camping gear and mountain bikes. I've 
only got room for 1 car and this is it. 
It'll outrun most other cars- and you 
can take 4 friends and all their gear 
with you! Fuel economy is great as long 
as you stay out of the turbo but it 
performs so great you'll always be 
going fast. Great car for going long 
distances in a hurry. 
With incentives and low sales this car 
is a hidden gem. You'll get this car 
for far less than the ""competition"" and 
you can spend the money you save on 
upgrades from Hirsch Performance- then 
you'll have a wagon with 310hp and 
325ft-lbs of torque!"
saab,9-5,2002,BruceB73, 08/21/2002,Just Got It,4,"I got my 9-5 about a week ago now.  
First SAAB I've had and I love it.  I'v 
had MB, BMW, Lexus.  This is as good as 
them all for a lot less.  The 
performance is really great.  I 
compared it to a BMW 325 & 525, Audi A4 
3.0, Volvo S60 T5 and Volkswagen Passat 
W8.  If you're in the market for a 
sports sedan, you have to try this 
car.  Not to mention that right now 
they are practically giving them away"
saab,9-5,2002,spidaman, 08/28/2002,Deal of the Year!,4,"This is my third Saab, and clearly the 
best so far.  The Saab 9-5 2.3t Linear 
loaded with auto transmission and 
premium package for $339/month 
lease is a great value.  The luxury 
plus performance plus safety and 
utility is unbelievable.  Even though 
this is the ""low-end"" 9-5, the 
acceleration is brisk (in Sport mode), 
the handling is responsive, although 
not super-tight.   A very comfortable 
ride for driver and passenger."
saab,9-5,2002,Deano, 08/31/2002,What a buy.....,5,"I have bought 16 cars in the past 25 
years and this was/is the BEST 
automobile I have ever owned! I have 
had a Lexus, Infiniti, BMW, and Fords 
and from the Dealership to the build 
of the car I give them both a 10!"
saab,9-5,2002,spot, 09/09/2002,back again,4,"This is my second 9/5. Had a 2001 and 
loved it. The 2002 is a little softer 
visually and doesnt have the same edge 
as the '01 did. Many improvements 
between the two years though. I've 
enjoyed now having an auto vs. stick. 
The sport mode really makes a 
difference."
saab,9-5,2002,Pete Saab 9-5, 11/06/2002,Amazing Car,5,"FIRST -- I have an automatic, not a 5 
speed (but Edmunds doesn't give that 
option).  

I really wanted a stick -- drove the 
previous model 9-5 -- then the '02 with 
Automatic in sport mode -- great 
transmission.

The car handles better then a 
comparable BMW wagon -- its taughter 
than Audi -- far more luxurious than VW 
Passat.

PLenty of room for passengers, and 
versatile cargo area."

OnStar, its great- travel info, where 
is ther nearest hotel with an indoor

you- Have a flat, SAAB roadside

Car handels great!!! awesome in dry 
and wet. fun to drive witht he turbo, 
and its so reliable, # 1 in JD Power

saab,9-5,2002,Jason 9-5 Aero, 10/27/2002,SAAB owner once more...,5,"I previously drove a 1988 SAAB 9000T, 
and I'm delighted that this new SAAB 
lives up to the SAAB standards for 
safety, performance, efficiency, and 
comfort.  

The Aero variant is perhaps the best-
kept secret in the automotive universe; 
its 0-60 time of 6.5 sec and top speed 
of 155 mph outperforms most rivals, and 
it's extremely comfortable, as well.  

The 5-speed manual is superb; clutch 
effort is light, and the gearshift just 
falls into place during double-clutch 
downshifts... bravo!

Torque steer is simply not an issue; 
there's none whatsoever.  The car just 
pulls and pulls, even in the rain!  
Fantastic OEM Michelin Pilot Primacy 
tires."
saab,9-5,2002,believer, 11/23/2002,Happy Decision,5,"After an extensive search , I am 
extremelly pleased with my purchase. 
The BMW 330xi- out significant price 
tag. It came down to an Audi A4 Quattro 
or a Saab 93/95. The Audi 1.8Turbo -a 
bit underpowered, it begged for 
standard transmition. Lacked 
convenience features standard on this 
category cars. The pumping seat 
adjustor was a bit odd. The Saab 95 is 
extremmelly smooth and does not suffer 
from lack of power with its automatic 
transmition. Very aggresive prices for 
leftover 2002 Saabs secured the 95 for 
less than the Audi A4."
saab,9-5,2002,My first Euro Car, 01/17/2003,First SAAB,4,"I was cross shopping top of the line 
TL, I35, Passat. Here are factors for 
deciding on SAAB:
The PRICE - I was cross shopping among 
the low 30s so you can guess how much I 
paid for my SAAB fully loaded
Performance - I test drove all 4 
mentioned above. In reality, ARE YOU 
going to do 0-60 for all the red 
lights? I was looking for more of low-
end torque to pass on highways and 
consistent power throughout and 
excellent handling (which ESP helps a 
lot)
Features - Out of 4 cars mentioned, 
SAAB was only short of (Nav sys of 
Acura, 4wd of Passat, Rear Shade of I35 
(not to mention 255hp)) But, other than 
that SAAB had much more features"
saab,9-5,2002,Scott Gault, 01/22/2003,Saab- 2002 -9-5 review,4,"The Saab 9-5 combines great performance 
with safety and comfort.  This car is 
better on ice and snow than my 4-WD 
truck. The traction control is 
awesome.  Great Mileage and stop in 
your tracks good looks."
saab,9-5,2002,glxfiles, 02/11/2003,Buy One You Won't Be Disappointed,4,"This is the best car I have ever 
owned.  I shopped Passat, S-60, 330i, A-
4. Saab had a better feel, better value 
and better materials than all but the 
Audi, problem is the Audi is ugly and 
way overpriced. The dealership was 
perfect and the car has some steep 
incentives that can really tip the 
scales in its favor.  But from the 
first drive the packaging and engine 
are light years better than my 87 900 
Turbo convertable.  This car is a 
welcome breath of fresh air and fun.  
On-star is great I recommend the 
calling feature."
saab,9-5,2002,Colonel, 02/16/2003,Third Saab is a Charm,4,"Car is a beautiful cosmic blue 5 speed 
Aero wagon.  Had to wait three months 
to take delivery, but has been worth 
the wait. Although not as tight a 
thoroughbred as my 1988 SPG or 1989 SPG 
it still is a excellant family 
performance vehicle.  Car accelerates 
effortlessly without turbo lag.  Car 
easily hits rev limiter if not carful 
and can hit 70 mph is second gear.  
Still have not approached 5 gear rev 
limit of car.  Suspension is softer 
than I'm used to, but it does make for 
a very enjoyable touring vehicle.  
Acceleration from 30 to 100 mph can be 
dangerous due to the amount of torque 
available from this light vehicle.  "
saab,9-5,2002,scottsdalebri, 09/03/2003,Great Deal,5,"This is my 2nd new Saab 9/5.  I am 
still amazed at all of the options that 
are standard on this car for the 
price.  Add at least $5k to any other 
cars in this class for the same thing."
saab,9-5,2002,binbunny, 09/19/2003,Love It All,5,"This my first Saab car although I 
looked at them back in the 80's. I 
needed a car that could easily handle 
the number of cats I have and not be a 
SUV. I liked the idea that not everyone 
was driving a Saab which makes it 
unique to me. I knew what I wanted when 
I walked in the dealership a Aero 
Sportwagon with Automatic and the 
Sports Package. The car they had wasn't 
the color I wanted but that didn't 
bother me at all. It was love a first 
sight and the color ( silver ) hides 
the dirt so well I have no regrets 
about the color choice.I plan on 
getting another Saab in 2005."
saab,9-5,2002,skday1, 09/19/2003,I love my Saab,4,"I love my car. The quality and comfort 
of the interior make it a joy to drive 
on any length trip. The automatic 
transmission has some lag, but overall 
I have found it to be smooth and 
responsive. If you are considering a 
Saab, you must test-drive one - the 
turbo makes it a blast to drive, with 
plenty of power for city and highway, 
at any speed.

I wish the 2002 had side-curtain air-
bags, but other than that I have no 
regrets, and only wish that I had moved 
to Saabs earlier. Prior cars have 
included a 94 Camry wagon and a 00 
Volkwagen Passat wagon. I liked the 
Passat, but I like the Saab better. 
This is a definite 10 year car. "
saab,9-5,2002,tedsmith944, 02/11/2005,Fast comfortable sedan,4,"Just bought this 2002 Saab 9-5 Aero sedan.  Went with the 5-speed manual.  This car is very, very fast at cruising speeds and is the perfect highway passing vehicle.  Torque steer and turbo lag are noticeable when driving around town.  I really like the Xenons as this is my first car with that type of lighting.  As an engineer, I am attracted to the engine technology; 250hp/258lb-ft is mighty impressive from 2.3 liters of displacement.  Furthermore, the engine management and gearing allow me to get great gas mileage.  Also, I wanted something that you don't see everyday, so the Saab is way cooler than a 330i (for example) in that respect.  Overall, I am very happy."
saab,9-5,2002,antrow, 10/22/2003,A cool wagon for young professionals,4,"I traded in an Acura 3.2 CL for my SAAB 
9-5 Aero Sportwagon. I loved my Acura 
but needed to have a car that I could 
haul things in. Too many times I was 
stuck at the store trying to shove 
plants and furniture items into every 
corner of my Acura. The SAAB was the 
only wagon that I thought looked cool 
and felt small and sporty but still had 
the room I needed. I have had lots of 
positive comments from people both 
young and old regarding the cars looks. 
So far I can say the car has been 
trouble free. My only complaints are 
the lack of low-end power before the 
turbo kicks in and the lack of good cup 
holders. Other than that I am loving it."
saab,9-5,2002,drlgu, 11/01/2003,Had to buy it!,4,"Since Saab was running 0% financing, I 
figured I would check it out.  My 
friends have had Saabs and loved them, 
so I figured a test drive would not 
hurt.  The dealer only had one 
Aero '03 on the show room, but there 
was a left over '02 that they had not 
sold.  The car looks great and really 
stands out in the sea of Bimmers, 
Benz's, and Audi's.  I was plesantly 
surprised by the acceleration, 
handling and interior room.  Needless 
to say, I got a deal that I could not 
refuse.  Great combination of sports 
car and luxury cruiser!        "
saab,9-5,2002,GregM, 11/04/2003,Stunning Swede,5,"My 'ferrari red' Saab Aero is simply 
stunning to look and to drive. Lots of 
power, especially the massive amounts 
of torque that makes driving this car 
seem effortless. Very quiet, smooth 
and stable all the way to 155+ mph. 
Handles like a sport coupe and has 
excellent brakes as well. Also the 
Aero is the most comfortable car I 
have driven, supremely comfortable 
seats! Lots of features unique in the 
industry and very rare! "
saab,9-5,2002,ssst, 01/12/2004,good alternative,4,"Fast acceleration, great passing 
ability at mid to high speed, great 
handling (considering its size and 
weight), and great torque at low RPM. I 
feel that I am driving a compact car 
than a midsize sedan. As a running 
machine, Saab 9-5 Aero is an excellent 
one, a great alternative to BMW 5 
series, Volvo S60. For 2002 Model year, 
Saab 9-5 is competitive feature wise. 
However, it is aging fast compare to 
others in 2003 or later model years. "

I love driving it, very comfortable, GREAT gas mileage (approx 32 mpg on highway, 20 mpg in town).  I love the styling - it doesn't look like everyone else's car. I have had no maintenance issues at all.  The dashboard cup holder works great -  just need two of them.  Performance while not outstanding is good enough to keep it fun. "
saab,9-5,2002,Chris, 12/19/2005,Not Quite Perfect...,3,"Was a great car at the beginning, until I started having quite a few mechanical problems.  Water pump went twice, turbo needed replacing, ignition module left me stranded on the highway, and a few other smaller things went all withing the 1st two and a half years.  Maybe I had a lemon, but it was enough to put me off of getting another Saab.  When everything is working, the car was a dream on the highway.  It gearing felt a bit off when city driving with manual transmission."
saab,9-5,2002,Believer, 03/20/2007,A lot of car for the money,4,I bought our Linear Wagon Saab CPOed from a local dealer with low mileage and warranty remaining.

saab,9-5,2002,tw, 06/30/2007,9-5 Arc,4,"3rd Saab I've owned.  Initially loved it.  Fun to drive, plenty of interior room, solid handling and quick.  Saab's poor quality control has convinced me this is my last Saab however.  I've had numerous failures of the temperature gauge. the fuel gauge and missing pixels on the dashboard Saab information display (SID).  Although it is just a display problem caused by poorly engineered wiring, to fix the problem you have to buy a whole new computer that costs hundreds of dollars.  "
saab,9-5,2002,Mike, 09/12/2007,Rip roarin' fun,5,"It's great to see people's startled expression when they're in the passenger seat and you step on it!  I did the all aluminum exhaust upgrade (lifetime warranty and 8 more bhp). Mileage has been a pleasant surprise, but hey, it's a 4 cyl after all.  Big car comfort, small car fun and all I've done after 66 months was replace the battery, finally.  I had never owned a Saab before, and relatively speaking I think they are somewhat pricey as new, but they prove to be worth it!"

but when I test-drove the Saab 9-5, I 
had to have it!  I had driven a Jeep 
Cherokee for 7 years, and needed a 
change.  This car fit the bill - made 
driving fun again and even handles 
better than my Jeep in the snow.  Just 
about everything about this vehicle 
screams style - I get so many 
compliments.  Great car at a great 
price (exceptional incentives).  "
saab,9-5,2002,Ralex, 06/04/2003,Unpretentious luxury,5,"I purchassed a Saab 9-5 after test 
driving one in March. The rebates were 
very enticing, and I've always wanted a 
European sedan. I have over 5,000 miles 
on it and am still excited every time I 
drive it. It has everything I'd hoped 
for in a luxury sedan. I was amazed at 
the fuel economy. On a recent trip to 
Tenn. I averaged over 30mpg. I would 
buy it again, even without the 
incentives."

upgrade over the 9000.  Everything so 
far has been excellent.  Vehicle has 
almost all of the options except the 
reverse backup indicator.  Got a great 
deal (0% financing + 1000's off of list 
price).  Lots of good forum's for Saab 
information which helped in purchasing. "
saab,9-5,2002,gtoman, 06/04/2003,Arc's Alright,4,"Overall, very pleased. I'm still 
surprised it only has 200hp since its 
performance belies that number! It's a 
blast to enter a highway with the rush 
of acceleration and launching it from a 
stop light in the Sport mode will snap 
your neck back."
saab,9-5,2002,Baron, 03/18/2002,Meets Expectations,5,"Got an automatic linear with the ESP, Harmon-Kardon Audio, memory steats, etc. package.  Smooth and sporty feel even with snows (these make the car as good as a 4WD in winter where originals are sketchy) Improved suspension from old 9-5 helps but it still understeers a bit.  Great trunk room which is key since I went from a pickup to the 9-5."
saab,9-5,2002,newsaabguy1, 03/18/2002,Linear 5speed sedan,4,"I also shopped the 9-3, X-type 2.5,  VW Passat & Jetta, Audi A4, Volvo V40 & S60, IS300 and Nissan Maxima.  The combination of performance, style, safety & luxury features, and comfort in the 9-5 were unbeatable at my transaction price just over $28k (thanks to GM employee discount and $3k incentive).  Assuming the reliability is there, I might actually keep this one longer than my average of 2 years.
I'm glad they resisted the urge to Passat-ize the car with chrome in '02.  I think the overall shape will age very well, I really can't see any changes in the interior for '02 except the color & finish of the dash veneer."

For a couple thousand less than a BMW 330i, I picked up my Aero which blows away the bimmer in terms of performance and fun factor. My cosmic blue also (in my opinion) matches the average Bimmer in looks, too. HP and torque from the Aero engine are equivalent to an Audi S4, but the Aero weighs about 230 lbs less. The result--it's tough to find a sedan that can match the Aero from 30 - 75 MPH. Saab has also done a great job tweaking the suspension--the responsiveness and composure of the car is awesome. Not to mention the great seats!"
saab,9-5,2002,Jason, 10/02/2019,2002 Saab 9-5 Aero Sport Combi,5,"This car is so comfortable and fun to drive. Really likes to stretch it's legs on the highway. I have the aero sport combi and it's got one of the largest cargo areas of any wagon out there. Fold the back seats down and haul a full sized fridge, lumber or anything you can imagine. The only modification I've done is replacing the suspension with bilsteins. 

The only concern for this year is that the engine had some sludging issues. Just use full synthetic and change your oil every 5k and it's not a concern.

saab,9-5,2003,thecarguy112, 01/16/2013,Better than the best!,4,"This is one of the best cars out there! I have the automatic transmission, and this car flys down the road!! it is very fast and has excellent handling. On the exterior, there is a very sleek and modern design (Black) that looks fantastic! The interior even though its old looks well done and seems to wear very little. let me talk a little about comfort, THIS CAR IS COMFY! The front seats are very high quality and are very supportive and hug you in. (drove non stop from my town to a town near by, which is a 100 mile round trip, 4 times in a row!) the seats have held up very well! Also, the cargo room is very impressive! (moved into a 2 bedroom with this car only.) So obviously I luv this car!"
saab,9-5,2003,Larry Twitchell, 07/10/2016,They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore!,5,"Get the maintenance records if at all possible before purchasing. If satisfactory to you, buy and prepare to enjoy yourself in a very good car. Operating costs are reasonable. It is a great, safe road car that eats up the miles in comfort. The only better seats would be in a Volvo but these provide great support. Living in New England provides a great variety of road conditions that are easily met by this Saab. It loves snow and can handle it as well as a lot of AWD cars today. Its ability to carry enormous loads is so surprising as many people think of Saab as a small car. After 13 and a half years I still look forward to driving this great car.
July 2018 - 145,000 miles. Still going strong as our second car. MPG averages 25 overall. Replaced original exhaust system in ‘17 and did rear brakes. Worth next to nothing as a trade but worth thousands to me. Bought this Saab new in Sept. 2003.
January 2019 - 152,000 miles and still loving it. Replaced a couple of tires and the others need new shoes, too. Really a great car!
July 2020- 155k, Original finishes still great. Runs like a top.

saab,9-5,2003,matt_beckman, 08/27/2012,Good for a passionate car lover.,4,"After driving 3 Saabs, a 2005, 2006 9.3 Turbo, and a 2003 9.5 Aero It is clear that Saabs are cars to be pampered and taken well care of. If you are looking for a reliable car with as little maintenance as possible this is not the car for you. Your better of with a Toyota. You will get what you give with Saab and the car is good for someone who enjoys taking care of cars as a passion and DOES NOT mind putting in an extra dollar to keep their jem running at top quality. For about $4500 the 2003 Areo is about the best sports car you can get for the price and
after regular
maintenance you can expect quick acceleration, good gas mileage, and an all over all smooth, stylish, and luxurious ride."
saab,9-5,2003,luthermarcus, 02/16/2015,Wasaab,4,"Great over all car! Picked one up for 2,100$ best buy for a car I ever had at this price and even if i bought a more expensive car. Car handles well in the snow has that ump -pick-up-and-go- feel and drive. I got this gem cheap. In 2015 to get 2003 with this reliable didn't think it was possible at the price i bought it. One thing is the radio not married to the car which is a pain i have to go to place with tech equipment to get it working but for 2,100 i can not complain about the radio. Love saab getting a new version in the future."
saab,9-5,2003,SAAB???, 09/01/2010,Love/Hate Relationship w my Saab,4,"I bought this car thinking it had great gas mileage which was perfect for the kind of job i have. Come to find out two weeks later my new Saab broke down on me on my way to a mini vacation. I've took it back to the selling dealer and they said ""there was no problem"". Took it from there dealership that same day on my way home it jerked and left me stranded in the middle of the road again! I hate this thing! It probably broke down on my more than 6-7 times before i took it into mechanics who really know foreign cars! Found out it was the fuel pump. I could not believe the dealerships could not find a problem. I guess I'm more upset with them than i am my car. i guess i love/hate this car"
saab,9-5,2003,saabinvt, 04/22/2012,Great ride!,4,"I bought my Linear with 81,000 miles in '09.
It's had some problems, but not outside what you'd expect with a car approaching 100K miles.
Yes, repairs can be expensive, but I've done much of them myself, and parts can be found on eBay and junk yards for cheap.
This car has a very smooth ride, is very quiet, the stereo is very good, the climate system is great and the controls are well laid out.
The dash cupholder is useless, but I just put aftermarket ones on the doors.
The acceleration is great, and I installed a high pressure turbo from an Aero, so now it really hauls!
While not cheap to maintain, 9-5s can be found used for far less than competitive cars, and they look better too."
saab,9-5,2003,carb1776, 10/22/2006,Swedish quality - Worth every penny,5,"This is my first Saab, bought it new. Looked at Lexus, Infiniti and Acura, liked the Saab the best. At 65 mph this sports car get 26-28 mpg, 22 in city. Quick acceleration for passing. Car really holds the road in bad rain and snowy weather. Would buy again! Interior is clean and sporty! Large trunk."
saab,9-5,2003,scalpel1000, 08/17/2003,Give it its due,4,"The Saab 9-5 Linear wagon is the best 
car that I have owned.  Its performance 
in and around the city along with its 
entrance ramp power make it fun to 
drive.  The 185hp is not excessive and 
provides a good medium between ultimate 
performance and gas consumption.  
Buying this car has made me a Saab fan 
and I would purchase one again."
saab,9-5,2003,Alexxx, 11/30/2003,Good!,4,"My other choices were the Audi A6, the 
new E60 BMW 5-series, E220cdi and 
Volvo v70. However, I just fell in 
love with this vehicle. I tried it in 
May, but I decided to keep my old car. 
Now that I saw it as a 2004 model I 
decided to go for it."
saab,9-5,2003,Aerocraft67, 08/14/2005,"Entry-level luxury, real sport & utility",4,"I upgraded from a Chevy Cavalier, so I am very happy with this vehicle. Imperfections are legitimate trade-offs. It feels large for the engine size. From a stop, the transmission and turbo feel confused unless you throttle very gently or heavily. Acceleration improves at high speeds (passing), and overall high-speed performance is excellent. This is a great highway car, but less nimble in dense traffic and tight spots. Otherwise handles well and feels safe, especially with stability control. The seats are very comfortable, and the controls are nice. Storage areas are inefficient. Underappreciated feature: towing capacity. Excellent value. Refined, safe, comfortable, practical, and economical"
saab,9-5,2003,goblue, 03/27/2004,Beats SUV Hands Down,4,"Having come from Arizona to Michigan, 
I've been driving SUVs for winter roads 
since I got here 10 years ago.  I 
decided it was time for a change and 
researched the market. The Saab wagon 
was the best looking, most fun to 
drive, safest and still offered enough 
interior room to displace the SUV.  To 
my surprise, it also went through the 
winter weather with ease.  I wasn't 
surprised when I learned the Aspen 
police all drive Saabs."
saab,9-5,2003,joev6, 10/04/2011,Excellent Car,5,"Bought this car from Valley Honda, Naperville a year back for 6500 + 2 year extended warranty... Amazing car, drive, performance, value for money from car. 

Saab cars are luxury which is affordable when you buy is used... An year has passed and car has only taken minor issues (I maintain it regularly) "
saab,9-5,2003,Wyatt Ryan, 10/25/2016,Don't Do It,3,"I've had this car for less than a year. Bought it for $4200 and have spent around $3000 on repairs. I absolutely love the car, but the repairs have taken their toll on my wallet. I would say the car has nickel and dimed me, but each repair has cost me $300 to $600 every time. The parts typically have to be shipped in from other states (I'm from Minnesota) since Saab stopped production in 2010. I have been left on multiple occasions without a vehicle for days at a time waiting for the parts to come in. If you're looking for a reliable car that is cheap to fix, please avoid this car. If you have the money and an extra car to drive around while this one spends the time at the autoshop, go ahead and get it. I would love to keep this car, but as I am a college student, I simply cannot afford to keep up with the repair costs. I had the turbo go out on me in March, the PCV Valve needed to be replaced about a week ago. The rear right suspension started leaking hydraulic fluid horribly as soon as I got it after putting it up on a lift to get new tires. The list goes on and on. The heating element in the front driver seat eventually burnt through the seat while I was using it, so I cannot use it anymore unless I want to burn my leg. The front passenger seat's leather ripped open slightly in February, too expensive to fix. Finding replacement windshield wipers for the front and back are impossible to find, as the connectors are vastly different from the normal ones on the market today. The front right headlight flickers a lot due to a faulty connection. The chipped key doesn't always work, so I am not able to lock the car some days, but it typically starts to work about 30 minutes after the ordeal begins. The front instrument panel was burnt out when I got the car, an easy fix, but not worth it at this point.                                                                                                                            Now onto the good things. It drives great, when it isn't getting fixed in the shop. I get excellent gas mileage (about 28) on the highway. Turbo response is great. Very comfortable to drive in. Heated and cooled seats are super nice to have. A/C and heat work really well. Back seats are also heated. Sunroof is a nice addition. Traction control works phenomenally, as does the ABS. It rides pretty nice, but expect to feel every bump and crack in the road. Overall, I'll miss Susie the Saab. If Saab was still in production today, I would probably keep the car, but the expenses are far too great for me to keep the car. Steer clear of this vehicle.

saab,9-5,2003,SaabingStu, 10/18/2010,Engine Failure,4,"Bought this car used with about 45K on the clock.  Had for 3.5 years and put about 70K miles on it.  Always ran synthetic oil, maintained the car very well, and the engine has failed at just 116K miles.  Very disappointed, as I really enjoyed this car, and it was my second Aero, and now have a worthless car. I don't think I'll ever buy another one.  also, very frustrating is the digital display always goes out on these things. "

Full of creature comforts such as heated front and rear seats, ventilated front seats. Seats are supportive yet comfortable. Air and heat are powerful and quick to get the cabin cool or warm. Brakes are awesome! Use only premium, get around 18 mpg mostly around town. Don't know why they stopped making this engine, it's superb! Still look forward to driving it after owning it for 3+ years. "
saab,9-5,2003,eb, 04/21/2009,GM's poor Engine Quality,3,"We bought this car pre-owned, had it inspected from a certified SAAB dealership and owning it for less than 2 years, we have spent over $3,000 on repairs.  The quality of this car is lousy.  Bought the car with 45,000 miles on it, and abruptly the warranty expires at 50,000 miles.  Since I am a previous owner of an Infiniti, I was used to the warranty expiration at 60k.  Immediately after warranty expires, our fuel pump fails, our alternator fails, engine coolant leak, and now we have a constant engine oil leak (header) which will cost more to repair than what the car is now worth.  And due to the fact that Saab is an import, all parts are imported and marked up."
saab,9-5,2003,Andrea29, 09/10/2009,Huge disappointment,2,"Bought the car with 44,000 miles on it, thinking SAAB was a quality brand and would last for years.  Unfortunately, I had not heard that repairs on a SAAB are extremely expensive. The car was initially fun, lots of bells and whistles. After 2 months, things started going wrong. The computer that controlled the temperature panel went out. The module controlling the high beams failed. The plastic panel under the driver's seat broke. Power locks did not work correctly. Other small items broke or stopped working. The final straw was at 96,000 miles when the throttle assembly went out. After a repair cost of over $1000, I traded in the car. I will not buy another SAAB."
saab,9-5,2003,, 10/28/2002,Saab 9-5 Arc,4,"In 2000 miles, I've experienced a car 
with oustanding highway & city driving 
capabilities. The seats are 
exceptionally comfortable (w/ heat and 
a/c !) Driving through a downpour on 
the highway provided me a great deal of 
confidence due to traction & stability 
control. The Sport mode on the trans. 
launches the car like it has 50 more hp
The stereo (240 watt Harmonn Karden) is 
awesome. The build quality is very good."

you stop and tst drive a 9-5. I leased 
mine and it has been so much fun I am 
sick I didn't do this sooner. As far as 
fun this car flies and shifts smooth as 
silk.  The radio Harmon 
Kardon sounds incredible. I have the 
touring package, and I reccomend this 
for anyone with two eyes who drives at 
night. ot only does the rear view dim 
but so dothe side mirrors. Should be 
standard on all cars. . Imust say

much improved over previous years.  The 
HK stereo is also outstanding.  We got 
the wood steering wheel and gear shift 
added and they look great."
saab,9-5,2003,santasaab, 08/05/2003,Third time is the charm,5,"This is my third Saab and definitely 
the best. My other two, a '78 EMS

but the 9-5 wagon has it all. This car 
offers an incredibly smooth ride. More 
low-end power than our '98 Maxima and 
features that are usually found only  
in cars at least $10,000 more than we 
paid. We also love the sporty styling 
and handling.
My wife originally wanted and SUV but

since."

I am a Saab fan from way back, but this one is the best.  I did have some minor throttle part problem that was a back- ordered part, but was covered under warranty.  Even then, the vehicle was drivable on ""limp"" mode, so it has never stranded me.  I did not like the original tires, but replaced them with Turanzas at 40,000 miles and am very pleased with the added quiet and drive."

functionality (I recently fit in 4 
large suitcases, 4 smaller bags, 4 
adults, and a snowboard on top) and 
performance (0 to 60 mph in under 7 
sec.)  It is not as flamboyant as some 
of the competitors, yet dollar for 
dollar, it is a better car than any 
other one I can think of.  I stand by 
every penny I paid for it!"

This car has met and exceeded all of 
my expectations significantly. This 
car is a perfect cross between a 
luxury sedan and a European sports 
sedan. It is very unique all the way 
down to the pop-out cupholder. I could 
not ask for more power in a car - this

(Why didn't we get an SUV? Too big for 
my wife, a relatively inexperienced 
driver, and inconsistent with our 
philosophy and fuel economy wishes.) 
This is a perfect family car for us. 
It's pricey, but compared with other 
cars in its price class, it gives us 
what we need: safety, room, comfort. If 
you want a real performer, I'm sure 
you'll be happier with a BMW or Audi.

already kicked in once (oops!). 
Edmunds said it didn't have enough 
power - they are very WRONG - it has 
more than enough - especially with the 
sport feature. The zenon lights are 
very cool, I like the dimming mirrors 
too. Once I got used to it, I liked

comfy riding luxury car without being 
a ponderous barge or calling undue

saab,9-5,2003,SEAN, 01/08/2005,AWSOME...AND THEY ONLY GET BETTER,5,"This is my third Saab and I will never buy anything else.  The interior is near perfect and styling and handling second to none.  If run of the mill is your desire, then look to a Benz or Bimmer.  If style fits you then look no further.  Even with the 4-cyl it has power to spare and is a kick to drive.  Winter mode is fantastic and it cuts thru the snow like a champ.  For a second drink holder look to the web.  This car turns heads and corners better than my jag at a fraction of the cost and repairs.  Tons of room inside compared to the 3-series or C-class.  Don't underestimate the Swedes, this car is first class.  Drive it, buy it, and love it."

The only leg up this car has is the acceleration and body cladding. In one year, I have replaced the engine, replaced the head gasket for the replacement engine, fuel pump, injectors, turbo, DI cassette, SID display, tabs that keep the windows from rattling, an electrical junction box, and I paid for emission hose updates (not covered by warranty), and yesterday a pully broke leaving me stranded. The car has only 71k miles, and I've owned it for only a year. This is my 3rd and worst SAAB. This car was built for the service bay and not the road. My love affair with SAABs is over."

Saabs don't necessarily impress immediately, but live with the car for a good amount of time and you'll see what gems they are. The highway passing power is laugh inducing, the comfort is unsurpassed by even cars costing 9x as much. The seats are to die for. Ours has only had small issues, which can be taken care of for very little at our local independent Saab specialist. This has been one of the most reliable cars we have owned, it's just extremely important to perform preventative maintenance and not to ""let things go"". But that really goes for any car, especially European. The build quality is very high and materials extremely good quality. "

The terrible depreciation is the used car buyer's gain and I bought three years from new for about 45% of list.  The car turned out to be a big surprise after 4 years and about 40K miles I have driven. Few mechanical problems, although they were either covered by the remaining factory warranty or the extended one I bought.  I am very impressed with the highway cruising ability but it is not my prior 911 or 540 (nor did I expect it to be). It is generally an all around good car with lots of room and decent driving fun.

I took it back to the selling dealer and also their Saab dealer and they slapped the machine on it and ""Nothing is wrong with it, it drives like a champ."" Again it had just died as i was accelerating through town, and then my speed gauge gradually goes down once again! On my way back from work on the freeway it died again! DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL.

Have had the typical failures -- fuel pump, heater valve, ignition cartridge, sunroof, and most recently the brake booster.  Repairs are crazy expensive, and I've spent way too much on them.  But then I get behind the wheel and realize I really like the driving experience.  Fuel economy is great, and the turbo is there when you need some punch.  It's a great travel car, and the trunk is spacious.  One of my criteria was ""4 men and 4 sets of golf clubs"".  It works."

For instance the dashboard info display was rebuilt, the ignition switch has to be replaced and the trunk harness which controls the trunk lock and the tail lights was replaced. There is no manual key entry for the trunk. Recently the DI cassette in the engine was replaced ($550) to address the most recent 'Check Engine' light. "

We leased the car in late May. In mid-
July it started gushing transmission 
fluid. Roadside assistance took 2 days 
to pick up the car. Sat on dealer lot 
for 5 days before someone looked at it. 
By that time, transmission fluid leaked 
into ignition system. Took another 2 
days to fix. We were supposed to get a 
Saab as a loaner car; we got a Ford 
Focus instead.
My parents (we share the payments) 
drove it to Atlanta. They averaged 66 
mph and 32 mpg. Thumping noise started 
coming from Air conditioning.
This morning, it began to leak 
transmission fluid again."

far.  Build quality is superb.  Not a 
single defect.  And the body is stiffer 
and tracks better than my old 900 or my 
old 9-3.  Plenty of power in the base 
model and it handles beautifully.

The only thing I don't like is the 
dealer where I purchased.   But then 
again, have you ever met a car salesman 
that you liked?  I bought from 128 Saab 
for the price, I go to Charles River

This is the most amazing car I have 
driven.  At speeds approaching 90MPH it 
is as smooth as lower speeds (and I'm 
sure it could do more).  The car 
handles extremely well and offers a 
smooth ride.  The interior is 
uncluttered but has all of the features 
you could want, and a few more you 
didn't know you needed!  This car looks

Get a 5 speed. It makes it much more
fun to drive.  I drove a Passat, 
and it is no match. Try to buy one 
soon. The incentive program was a 
big reason I have one in the garage.
The Harmon Kardon stereo is great.
I usually replace the stereo in all

Mercedes 300SE, Cadillac Sedan 
DeVille, Lincoln Town Car, but I am 
forever out of that class of vehicle

choice.  Many people talk about this 
car being quirky.  If quirky means 
slightly different that most models in 
the pack sure.  However, a personality 
does not, to me, mean quirky.  While 
not a reason to buy a car, it is also

amazing automobile. Everything you

wonderful car. It's nimble, 
powerful, comfortable & quiet. The new 
steering wheel shifting is a nice 
touch, & the new 5-spd auto always 
keeps the car in the boost. The Bi-
Xenon headlamps are better than all of 
the Japanese Xenons (better than the 
Acuras and Lexus GS in particular), & 
most of the Germans(Mercedes and Audi &

first rate, and the ride and handling 
have reached that perfect balance of

and performance. It produces 250 hp and 
holds the road like it is on the rails 
(ESP) is highly recomended.
Whe it comes to performance it really 
kills BMW 530(225 hp), Audi(A6 3.) and 
MB C320 or even E320.  It it more fun 
to drive then all the cars mentioned 
above.  
Interior is not the best when it 
compared to the rest in the same 
catagory.  Audi A6 is a clear leader 
but then Audi lacks the sporty 
stylying  of 9-5.    
My wife drives BMW 530 and I just 
traded in my A6(2.7T) with Aero and 
loving it more then the A6.  Aero is 
young and gives a sporty feel. I hope

Unlubricated steering column,
rattles, a door hinge came loose 
causing a mean whistle in the door, 
panel lights flickering, other 
electrical issues.  Aside from those, 
the cupholders are ridiculous.  The one 
in the front armrest is unusable, and 
the one on the dash is to flimsy to put 
anything in but a can of coke.  
Acceleration is fine, but the car has 
no grip on any surface.  The tires 
squeal at anything more than a soft 
touch to the peddle.    
All in all, I feel like I paid 40,000 
dollars for a Hyundai."

around So CA racking up 800 miles. The 
car handled perfectly and aside from 
missing the extra rear leg room in the 
735il, I was perfectly satisfied. No 
rattles, and the handling was great. I 
looked at 540, e320, Lexus, etc,

have no regrets."

Ana.  The car is loaded and georgeous. 
Decided on it versus great deals on new 
2002 Audi Allroads or A6 Wagons. The 
others are beautiful also, but the 
hinging factors were reliability 
concerns and gas mileage.  The Aero 
wagon is just like any nice sports 
sedan. It feels connected, smooth and 
powerful. For the price and features, 
it matches well with the other luxury 
makes. The audi's are a bit nicer 
inside and have AWD advantage, but you 
have to shell out alot more cash to 
beat it perfomance wise."

balanced car on the market, if you look 
at price, performance, comfort, fuel 
economy and cargo space.  The car is  
has no torque steer like my old Viggen 
did.  The automatic transmission shifts 
seamlessly, and for a wagon, it corners 
with minimal body lean. Vented and 
heated seats are fantastic, and the 
auto dimming interior and outside 
mirrors should become the de facto 
standard on all cars.  The Harmon 
Kardon stereo sounds incredible.

wonderful car!"

buyers remorse, mainly because the ride 
is so jittery compared to my Sable 
wagon.  I bought one of those cheesy 
vinyl steering wheel covers to reduce 
vibration on the wheel.  It helps a lot.
But I've gotten fairly used to it.  
Seats are awesome and I like the rear 
cargo shelf, which gives you extra room 
in back.  The HK stereo ROCKS!  The 
cupholders, as everyone will agree, 
suck.  Supposed to have decent 
reliability, but I've already had it in 
the shop once, so this 
remains to be seen.  Am I a Saab 
convert?  Don't know, but there is 
something about these cars on a test

lack of attention to the uality of the 
little things. FOr example, headlights

just my car as I have seen several 
other 9-5s with the one-eyed stare. 

Additionally, the plastic covers for 
the rear center tail light and the 
overhead light both broke over the 
course of three years. 

The car is extremely confortable and 
in the Sport mode is a total kick to

avoid the classic Saab turbo lag. "

torque."" A truly excellent car. An 
additional virtue is its volumnous

not important in our buying decision.  
The automatic adjusting rear view

Well,thats about it."
saab,9-5,2003,Saabdude, 11/22/2003,An awesome car for the money,5,"I liked the 9-5 Aero when I first drove 
it, but was going to go with something 
a bit more ""mainstream"" like a G35 or 
04 Acura TL.  But I have to say that 
after one month I am loving my Aero.  
The car handles well, accelerates 
great, and is very comfortable.  I like 
the styling, both interior and 
exterior.  You really feel like you're 
in a luxury car, whereas others in this 
price range feel more like pricier 
versions of regular sedans.  Do 
yourself a favor and test drive this 
car before you buy something in this 
price range - realizing that if you do 
your homework and wait for the right 
incentives, this car can be purchased 
for $7K or more below MSRP."

- just BEAUTIFULl!!  Had a 2001 9-5SE 
before this....the HOT Turbo makes all the 
difference in the world delivering phenom 
acceleration.  Whatever you do, test drive on 
the highway in 'sport' mode (watch out for 
the cops and speed traps!!)."
saab,9-5,2003,M Hesseling, 01/05/2004,nigh on perfect,5,"Lot's of fun to drive: My 2.3 mile 
commute was fun in my previous car 
(2000 9-4 Convertible SE HOT), but this 
is even better. The occasional drive to 
Chicago is a thrill since there are 
lots of chances to surprise the odd 
sportscar driver.

Thought I'd use the sentronic paddle 
shifting more but the sport 
transmission probably does a better job 
at shifting than me (and this is my 
first automatic ever). 

Absolutely love this car."
saab,9-5,2003,Aero Slaab, 09/27/2005,"Asphalt-eating, value-minded, rocket",4,"Exceptional value in the used market. Great punch 2000-5000 rpms where the turbo really shines. The sport mode on the auto works very well.  Seats are extermely comfortable, even on long drives > 12 hrs.  I really appreciate gas mileage near 26 MPG around town, near 30 on highway fully loaded with family and vacation gear; but premium gas req'd for the Aero is a bit to bite on.  Exterior is a bit dated, but very clean lines are aging well.  Just a terrific overall car that is vastly under-appreciated in the used market.  Good examples will be easier to get as 3 yr leases on these expire.  Saab's CPO program yields an excellent warranty to boot."
saab,9-5,2003,ZZ, 12/11/2003,Arc: the best buy,4,"I never thought I would own a SAAB 
until I test-drove the Arc the very 
same day I drove Acura TL/Infiniti 
G35/Volve V70. I was impressed most for 
the Arc due to the superbo response and 
handling. It is the best combination of 
performace and safety with the best 
standard equipments and features for 
the class although a touring package is 
a big plus. It is an outstanding car!"
saab,9-5,2003,sgylfe, 01/16/2004,Typically good Saab,4,"This is my third Saab, and I have 
found them to be dead on in terms of 
ride comfort, lots of convenient 
features, great trunk space and 
passenger room, and has great turbo.  
Gas mileage isn't as great, but that's 
with city driving."
saab,9-5,2003,cookees, 01/15/2004,Drive one...you'll buy one,5,"Looked at just about every concievable 
car: Accord, Acura, Avalon, Infinity, 
Lexus, LeSabre, and narrowed it down 
to the Volvo S-80. Was all set to buy 
the Volvo when we test-drove the Saab 
on a whim. The deciding factor was 
the ""drive"" and the final pricing.
The S-80 is a very nice car and you 
will like the ride quality. However 
the Saab lets you feel like you are 
piloting the car instead of merely 
going along for the ride. Add to that 
the comfortable,almost chiropractic 
seats, coupled with phenomenal gas 
mileage on regular gas, and the choice 
is easy."
saab,9-5,2003,SaabStory, 03/01/2004,This SAAB 9-5 is a pleasure to drive,5,"I never owned a SAAB before, but I 
certainly am impressed with this 
vehicle.  It handles very nicely.  I 
found myself taking drives for fun on 
Sunday mornings at sunrise just to 
buzz around for enjoyment.   On nice 
weekends, I would drive to a new place 
just for an excuse to hammer around 
some curves and blast tunes with the 
sunroof open.   Now I know this sounds 
like B.S. but it's true.  This car may 
not be a true thoroughbred, but for 
the money it's probably the best that 
I'll be driving with a family of four 
for my ""other"" times behind the 
wheel.  "
saab,9-5,2003,MUWOLV, 03/15/2004,Under Rated!!!,5,"I am amazed by the J.D. Power and 
Editors reviews.  I've owned my 9-5 
Aero for about 10 months and have 
11,500 miles on it.  I have not had one 
problem.  The car is fun to drive, 
tight, and different.  You don't see a 
lot of Saabs in the Detroit area.  I 
drove the BMWs, Audis, VWs, Lexuses, 
Infinitis, etc. and none of them were 
the complete car that the Aero was.  
Furthermore, the Aero was actually 
cheaper when you added the eqivilant 
options to the other brands.  I would 
recommend a 9-5 Aero to anyone.  I 
enjoy it more every day that I drive it."
saab,9-5,2003,CSA900, 06/07/2006,Fun four door,5,"Great vehicle around town, lots of FUN in sport mode.  This car has amazing torque, feels even faster than it is.  Great stereo, excellent air conditioner. 32 mpg on the highway, but only 19 around town in sport mode with your foot in it!"
saab,9-5,2003,Mr. B, 08/22/2006,2003 Saab 9-5 Aero,4,"It took a long time for me to decide to purchase my Aero. I always loved the styling and didn't ever really hear anything horrible about them. Now that I've put about 6,000 miles on the car including some spirited road runs, stop and go Milwaukee driving, a 345 mile jaunt to the U.P of Michigan, and the late night trek to the grocery store, I've found the car to be responsive, sure-footed, very smooth, comfortable, and suprisingly reliable. I take care of my autos and this one really seems to have a lot going for it.  My only hang up with the car is the cost of parts and labor, when you need it. I haven't run into any issues with my Aero yet, but I anticipate that when and if I do, it's not gonna be pretty. Thank God for warranty work."

saab,9-5,2003,VSN, 08/23/2004,I'll buy another one!,4,"I've had my Saab nearly 2 years now and 
have no major problems, other than 
routine maintenance.  It has been a 
blast to drive.  My Aero model has the 
manual shifters on the steering wheel 
so I can be performance driven when I 
need it most!  The steering, braking, 
comfort, interior are awesome and so 
much better than my previous luxury 
vehicle (which will go unnamed!)  My 
only minor complaint is lack of 
interior storage areas for CDs and misc 
items.  But the cup holder is the best 
in the business!  I'll keep buying 
Saabs until the dealership turns me 
away.  My best car ever!"

from an 8 cylinder Lexus I was 
concerned about power and pickup - no 
problem here.  Great accelaration, 
sporty, fun to drive -  and practicle!  
I figure if I'm going to have a 
stationwagon, I'd like to have one that 
can move around those teen punks 
without any effort... And so much 
better mileage than a SUV.  I'm doing 
my part to reduce dependence on Middle 
Eastern Oil...  Great Car!"
saab,9-5,2003,Domer90, 05/10/2005,Gotta Love the 9-5,5,"This is my 3rd Saab and I love each new one better than the last.  The interior is very large and the styling is simple yet functional.  You can sit in the car and in under a minute know where everything is, and how to use it.  The turbo is great especially with a 4- cyl.  It handles great in and out of traffic and takes an on/off-ramp at 70 (not that anyone would do that) like it is stuck to the road.  Winter mode makes snow travel easy and safe.  the trunk is gigantic, especially with split fold down rear seat.  As you can see I love this car."
saab,9-5,2003,Partha Mohanram, 05/25/2005,Who Thought A Wagon Could Be Such Fun,4,"We were looking for a Wagon in 2003. Our initial choices were the Audi A6 and Volvo XC 70. Didn't think of Saab as we wanted AWD. However, with all its safety features, electronic stability protection, Traction control etc, we don't miss not having AWD.  We chose the Saab, and I think we made a great choice. This car is great fun to drive, reliable, spacious and comfortable. Fuel Economy is terrific, we get close to 25 mpg for city/highway combo driving.  The seats are very comfortable, and the console display reminds you of a cockpit. Love the ""cooled"" seats - no need to sweat with leather seats in summer."
saab,9-5,2003,Ozzie, 07/31/2005,Bullet proof Saab 9-5,5,Just a great car. Never a problem and looks great (even when dirty)

Despite having difficulties with the vehicle, I continue to enjoy it."
saab,9-5,2003,david3d, 09/08/2005,Fun to drive & Cool to look at,4,"The Saab Aero is a very fun car to drive, the turbo kicks in effortlessly pushing you back in your leather seat.  The car sticks to the road, and in ""sport"" mode you can move in and out of traffic with no hesitation.  The car's styling is aggresive let refined, with the classic Saab clam shell hood.  "
saab,9-5,2003,Wallerich, 10/04/2005,What a gem of a car.,5,"I've had over 14 Saab's in the past 20 years, but this Aero takes the cake. Put some Goodyear F1 tires on it, and there's no car on the road that can surpass the ride, cornering, and mileage for less money.  No other car is more fun to put through it's paces as the Aero.  This car has been flawless and 100% reliable.  Perhaps the stereo could be a touch better, but at 130mph, I'm not focusing on the music.   2 yrs ago a guy blew a light at 65 mph and creamed me.  I was going 40.  I walked away.  Thanks to GM for not screwing up a classic, and keeping the price reasonable.  Yahoo."

saab,9-5,2003,Bruce, 08/31/2006,Taking flight,5,The car has completely lived up to my expectations and the few small bugs I dealt with in my 2000 base model 9-5 were completely absent in this model. The engine is very strong and the handling is very good and often suprisingly so. The bonus set of skills gained at the Aero Academy really pointed out the remarkable breaking and handling capabilities of this car.  Kudos all around for the remarkable comfort. The ventilated seats are an additional treat here in Southern California summers.
saab,9-5,2003,Don, 10/04/2006,Super car,5,hHandles beautifully. Amazing cornering and wonderful headlights.

German cars. This car does it all 
without the ""baggage"" of owning a BMW

and the Aero screams! Active 
ventilated seats are great if you live 
in Florida. Dealer was excellent."
saab,9-5,2003,Trebla, 01/03/2007,2003 Aero,4,"Best car I've owned (of 12 in 42 years of driving). Fast, fun, comfy but not floating, gets 26-31 mpg and easily does 110 mph on highway. Astonishing acceleration 40 to100, which is where most of us actually use it."
saab,9-5,2003,NineFiveAero, 01/28/2007,One Sweet Swede,5,"You would have to be pretty hard pressed to find a better sport sedan for what these cars bring used.  Saab has tuned the Aero with usable power.  Tons of torque and very responsive.  Goes to show you that you don't need a big, heavy, gas guzzling V8 to have power. These cars are true ""sleepers"".  A timeless design and high quality interior materials, especially the beautifully sculpted sport seats wrapped in high quality leather.  The performance, equipment, and styling are impossible to beat at this price point, plus, Saabs are still relatively exclusive.  It will definitely stand out in the packs of 5-series BMWs.  These cars deserve much more credit than they get."
saab,9-5,2003,Frank, 03/09/2007,Very good,4,"Everything is excellent, only the fuel economy is not so good, but you can't have it all."
saab,9-5,2003,Jolie, 04/10/2003,You just can't beat for the $. Excellent,4,"This is my second Saab after upgrading 
form an 9-3. There is absolutely no 
comparison. I am leasing this vehicle 
for the price that someone would pay 
for a loaded Accord or a Camry. The car 
is extremely confortable to drive. Saab 
offers free maintenance for up to 
30,000 miles, and the luxury level is 
second to none. The car has plenty of 
pep, especially if driven in sports mode
I might buy it after my lease is over. 
I really doubt that I will be able to 
find a better buy in another two years."
saab,9-5,2003,famvanman, 03/10/2007,Second-hand Saab,4,"Recently bought this car with 56,000 miles. Although it is the Linear base model, it is a very nice machine overall; 4 cylinder economy with the turbo to add power when needed.  Very solid feel on the road and good handling without harsh feedback from the pavement.  Generous interior space and full size trunk.  Many nice features, very good stereo and overall a unique feel to the car."
saab,9-5,2003,baco99, 03/09/2007,Saab makes great cars,4,"Our 2003 Saab 9-5 Arc wagon is a superb car to own and drive.  Yes, there are a few Saab quirks to get over, but the pleasure of driving it far outweighs any minor nuisances.  Ours is equipped with the Sentronic automatic transmission and performs very well.  In ""Sport"" mode the transmission responds very quickly, especially out of 1st gear and is like IRL's ""push to pass"" button.  The interior is quiet and comfortable.  The wagon has great cargo room and our 2 dogs love it back there.  With a baby on the way, it's a very sensible and responsible purchase, with much better gas mileage than our neighbors' SUVs. This is our 4th Saab, and we'll be back to the well again in a few years.  "
saab,9-5,2003,bah, 03/06/2007,Solid Car,4,"Very nice car, frustrating issue with in dash display module indications that appears to be a factory issue. Excellent handling in ice and snow/rain. Very solid fit and finish. Gets a little expensive out of warranty."
saab,9-5,2003,Bromo33333, 04/11/2003,A real SPORTwagon,4,"This wagon has generous interior room, 
and very comfortable seating.  The back 
seats folds flat giving a large useable 
space to haul a lot of stuff. The seats 
are very comfortable. 
This thing can move if you want to, and 
if you want to overtake at 60mph, you 
will have more than enough power to do 
so safely.  
If you want a car that can haul a lot 
of stuff, and handle like a dream, go 
really fast, and large and copious 
cupholders don't matter to you, the 
Saab 9-5 Aero Sportwagon will fit the

saab,9-5,2003,hr_consultant, 04/18/2003,The Aero Soars,5,"I've had my '02 Aero for 6 months and 
I have not had one problem with it.  
I've not experienced any turbo lag at 
any speed, as a matter of fact, there 
is torque in every gear.  Saab has 
included ESP (electronic Stability 
Program) that virtually eliminates 
torque steer.  I have to be careful, 
I'm generally way over the freeway 
speed by the time I shift into 
fourth!  Unique look and feel, I 
always get lots of positive feedback 
when anyone asks about the car.  After 
all that cool technical stuff, one of 
the things that gets the biggest 
reaction is when the cupholder opens, 
go figure."
saab,9-5,2003,John C., 08/29/2007,Saab 9-5 Aero,3,"Have had my 9-5 about 7 months.  Although there have been a few things that needed attention, I love the car.  It has a dual personality: practical family hauler (I have 3 kids and do the school drop-off in the mornings... backpacks, musical instruments, computers, sports equipment, it all goes in the trunk), gets close to 35 mpg on the highway, but at the same time is a highly entertaining performance sedan.  Great seats, great stereo, but interior ergonomics are not great. I think it's one of the best looking 4 door cars on the road.  Try to find one that has some factory warranty left on it."
saab,9-5,2003,Slugworth, 04/28/2003,Go with the AERO!!,4,"I got the Aero with all options for a great 
price and the dealer actually made the 
dreaded experience enjoyable!   I chose this 
over the 325, 525, i300, G35 and CTS.  I 
actually started looking at the 9-3's, but 
wanted a bit more space and loved the 
metal trim in the Aero."
saab,9-5,2003,M.A.D.MikE, 10/20/2007,Best in class.,4,"Used to own a 1994 VW Passat VR6, and didn't want anything slower. Narrowed my search to A4 or Passat with the same 1.8T engine, BMW E39 or 46, C Classe and Mazda RX-8. Didn't even consider Saab at that time. But after sitting in different cars at used car lot, felt in love with 2000 Arc model and went straight home to do some research. Found a black 2003 Aero and bought it the same day. It's 440 pounds heavier than my old car but the acceleration is just stunning! The only major problem with this car is $3000 I had to pay on my 90k servicing :( Nevertheless I would buy it again if I had the chance and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a compromise between sport and luxury."
saab,9-5,2003,sponz, 05/01/2003,love my new saab,5,"I have been driving the 9-5 Arc for one

some luxury cars but it beats them all 
with ride and handling."
saab,9-5,2003,shellEy, 11/16/2007,Not worth the money,3,"For a car that costs as much as this did, I expected much higher quality. The engineers did a poor job of ergonomic design, parts break (and when they do, it's *very* expensive to fix), and there are known bugs which Saab doesn't seem to care about fixing. (Repairs on my car in 100,000 miles: fuel pump, brakes (twice!), rear-hatch-closed sensor, engine-temp gauge...)  My pet peeve is if you set the interior temperature, I expect the car to maintain that temp.  Instead, it'll either be too hot or too cold."

(G35, CTS, 330i) I was blowen away by 
how complete the 9-5 was.  The stiffer 
aluminium suspension makes a big 
difference in the handling yet the ride 
is smooth on the road. The HOT I-4 
loves to be revved off the line but it 
really shines on the highway passing, 
it gets from 60-80 faster then any car 
I have driven.  Also, the 5 speed 
automatic is better matched to this 
engine then the stick.  When I compared 
the safety fetures and reputation of 
SAAB, their willingness to deal on the 
car and the full option list, it was a 
winning deal.  Fully loaded I got this

I suggest finessing the gears rather than jamming them like a Corvette...the Swedish gear shift doesn't love it. Overall, I love it! Best bang for the buck!

saab,9-5,2004,hal9000, 12/07/2008,Great Used Value,4,I think '04-05 Saab 9-5s are one of the best kept secrets on the used market.The resale value of GM era Saabs stinks. Bad if you want to buy a used one and sell it in two years. Great if you want a terrific content filled bargain you can drive for years. All the early bugs have been worked out. You get a vehicle that ranks tops in safety. Speed if you want it. Fuel efficiency if you want it. Plenty of passenger and cargo room. Very smooth ride(even with my Aero suspension). I also prefer the body style of the '04-05 vs. the '06. Don't be scared of the Saab stories you here from people. Most are probably from 9-3 owners and those are a very different vehicle than the 9-5.
saab,9-5,2004,TD02131, 08/05/2010,I bought mine new,5,"I am not one to keep a car, I usually trade before the warranty runs out. This is the first car I've kept beyond the warranty. I traded a new Toyota Highlander in on it, the Highlander was just boring to drive. The Saab has never disappointed. I have been considering trading it, but I can't find anything better for the money. I may run this one for 300,000 miles. They're right about the tires - go with the michelins. Cup holders are not my priority when deciding on a vehicle. In fact, I hate all the cars with open cup holders that get gunk in them. It's roomy, safe, reliable and fun to drive."
saab,9-5,2004,Joe L, 01/21/2018,Keeping mine till they start making them again!,5,"Bought mine new in 2004 and am now approaching 150,000 miles.  All three of my kids learned to drive with the Saab, and it became their car of choice (even though it lacks modern features like USB or Aux ports to the stereo).  My only major issue so far was a HVAC failure that cost hundreds to repair.  Otherwise, engine and transmission remain solid (knock on wood).  The car still handles as well as anything I have owned or rented - a perfect balance between riding comfort and handling, in my opinion.  And my gas mileage has been excellent.  Low to mid 30s on the highway, blended average in the low to mid 20s.  It's also an excellent winter car (I live in Minneapolis).  I have had great luck with Nokian tires and with Firestone.

saab,9-5,2004,mr_monza, 12/25/2011,I Hope Saab Returns,4,"It's really a shame----bordering on despicable----that the failed General Motors Corporation, survivors only due to the U.S. government flooding them with millions of our tax dollars----saw fit to essentially drive Saab out of business.
It's a long story, but suffice to say, holding preferred shares of Saab stock, GM blocked the sale of Saab to a Chinese company, forcing them into bankruptcy.
As I write this, Saab is hanging by a thread hoping to find a buyer GM will ""allow"" or finding a different way to stay in business, without the devils at GM lording it over them.
Regarding my car----it's a 2004 Saab 9-5 Arc Wagon, with automatic transmission.
I bought it new.
Reliable, great car. "
saab,9-5,2004,mr_monza, 07/29/2011,Bought It New...Hoping Saab Stays In Business!,4,"We bought this car in August of 2004 while my wife was pregnant.
We needed the utility of a station wagon but wanted something that was fun to drive and had a decent level of luxury appointments.
The Saab has not disappointed!
This is a medium sized wagon that's comfortable and has plenty of space for a trip to the beach.
It gets over 30 MPG on the highway and has a very spirited performance from its 220 HP turbo.
It's not our only car, so it has low mileage (around 32 K).
It has not had any significant problems at all----a very safe and reliable car.
The quality of the materials is excellent.
The paint finish remains like new. No complaints at this point---still love driving it."
saab,9-5,2004,SwedeH, 09/06/2003,second wagon,4,"This is my fourth SAAB and I have loved 
all of them.  My convertible was the 
best of all but was impractical for 
carrying loads and extra passengers.  
This is my second wagon and both are 
comfortable to drive, carry reasonable 
loads, and are not in a category with 
the cumbersome SUV's that guzzle gas, 
are difficult to squeeze into parking 
spots, and are hard for older people to 
climb into.  It has all the features of 
and SUV and is not a monstrosity.

I love it."
saab,9-5,2004,jkkf1991, 12/05/2007,Extraordinarily fun car,4,"I too have owned several BMWs and this SAAB needs to offer no apologies for anything by comparison.  Truly a fun car to drive.  Superb acceleration, handling, sound system, styling, and comfort."
saab,9-5,2004,Slee_Stack, 07/16/2008,Remarkable Balance,4,"Although I've only owned my Aero for just over two months, I've had some good experience with what this car excels at and what may be trouble spots. With all its gadgetry, I've already had my share of glitches, most notably poor performing rain-sensing wipers, a result of a poor sensor.  Various electrical gremlins also pop up on occasion, but are mild irritants at worst. The 9-5 in Aero guise is a great looking and oddly rare car in the sea of Bimmers, Lexii, and Benz that swarm the roads of Atlanta.  While in no way a neck-snapper, the Aero has plenty enough zip to best most 'sporty' sedans on the road.  Where it truly dazzles is doing this and still returning 30mpg on the highway"
saab,9-5,2004,Dennis S. Williams, 06/23/2008,Purchasing Overseas & Shipping Delivery,4,"Having purchased this car in Germany just before returning to the US for a new job, I was worried about having it delivered to an unfamiliar dealership.  My worries were unfounded as I have continued to have the car (as well as my older '98) serviced and maintained at the dealership and have been very satisfied."
saab,9-5,2004,Lon Sherer, 03/01/2006,Beautiful balance in the Arc sedan,4,"Performance is extraordinarily balanced in this car.  Handling, accelleration, and highway cruising are simply excellent.  The icing on the cake--and never seems to be mentioned in professional reviews--is its mileage! Over 30 mpg 70+  I don't know of a viable competitor with that combination of virtues.   "
saab,9-5,2004,dcarmstrong, 02/12/2007,Fabulous Aero,4,This 9-5 was our 7th Saab.  We upgraded to this and have loved it from day ONE.  The ventilated seats for the summer cooling are a great asset and my husband absolutely loves them.
saab,9-5,2004,Saab turbo, 07/28/2007,Great vehicle,5,"The car has around 45,000 miles on it and there are no creaks from inside. The ride is very quiet. The performance of the Aero is great and it's a lot fun with the turbo. The 9-5 has a lot of neat features like park assist, pockets in the front seats, cooled glove box, etc. It is very AEROdynamic and is still quirky compared to a BMW or MB. It has been very reliable and was much less that the competitor's cars. Has more style and character than any Lexus. "
saab,9-5,2004,CaliforniaSaab, 07/09/2010,Great car to by used,4,"No better value, as depreciation runs high. Got mine with 23,000 miles for $15k at Carmax. What a deal. Spotless reliability so far, now at 45,000 miles. Very comfortable. Great on freeway. Handling could be a little tighter but that's what you get with FWD."
saab,9-5,2004,Chet, 07/28/2010,Another great SAAB story,5,"This was my 2nd great SAAB. First was a superb driving, reliable, safe 2003 9-3 sedan (e.g..36 mpg at 80 mph on New Mex I40 at 105 degrees Fahrenheit. This SAAB 9-5 wagon has been problem free for almost all of its 100,000 miles. It has been all over the USA, full of ""stuff"", and still averages 34 mpg on the highway and 23 in town. Of course, I maintain its recommended maintenance schedule, don't you? Here's hoping the new owners of SAAB don't screw it up. "
saab,9-5,2004,twowhiteshoes, 09/10/2003,Fun in 2nd gear,4,"ok, this is a family station wagon, not 
a sports car. But when the turbo kicks 
in starting around 2500 rpm, usually in 
2nd gear, you can have a lot of fun. 
Also, for all you SUV drivers out 
there. This has the storage you need 
but it gets 40 mpg on the highway."
saab,9-5,2004,Rob, 02/12/2005,It's a blast to drive,4,"This Aero really MOVES!  I can't seem to keep it under 100 mph.  It's fun to drive.  I looked at the Audi A6 and the Volvo S60R, test drove them all extensively, but the fun factor and interior room in the 9-5 sold me.  I wanted a winter worthy car and front wheel drive is, for most practical highway purposes, as useful as AWD.  Great gas mileage on the 9-5 to boot. Just watch out for tickets!"

many service trips to count for 
annoying things (windows that wouldn't 
work, door locks that were stuck, back 
latch not working properly...etc). 
After driving the SAAB wagon we 
wondered why we even considered a 
Volvo! The handling and pickup is in a 
league of it's own, the gas milage 
makes our old Volvo look like a pickup 
truck!"
saab,9-5,2004,Indiana driver, 12/21/2003,Who needs an SUV?,5,"As a three time SUV owner, I never 
expected to own a wagon, much less to 
actually like driving one.  This car is 
actually fun to drive!  I love the 
smooth delivery of turbo power, and the 
solid, stable ride.  On snow covered

is the best car I have ever owned.  I 
would highly recommend it to anyone who

saab,9-5,2004,Ole Olsen, 05/16/2004,My SAAB in Norway,3,"I am now a 3-time SAAB owner.  This 
time, I live in Norway.  I clicked the 
Aero box because my Norway-model is 
closest to the Aero except for the 
engine.  I have the sports-seats, 
automatic trans, metal dash, leather, 
and 17-inch wheels, BUT ONLY a 150-
horsepower 2.0-turbo!

Nonetheless, this power is all one 
needs here (and I'd say also in the 
US).

The 9-5 is a great car, much peppier 
than my 1995 9000 US-export, which had 
a 2.3-turbo.  

The ride is much smoother than the 
9000, and the feeling is more one of 
soft luxury, even though these SAABs 
are considered FAMILY CARS here in 
Norway and Sweden."

interior is sturdy and wears very well. 
The materials always look new. I had a 
2000 model and it was the same. The 
interior room is adequate, yet the 
outside is not too big. Trunk space is 
great. The car could use a nicer stereo 
and the vanity mirrors have useless 
lights."
saab,9-5,2004,Kumar, 07/14/2004,2004 95 Aero,4,"Very comfi, did not realize what i was 
missing (I have an Isuzu Trooper). 
Very snug and well fitting seats. 
Great pickup and handling (not quite 
the same as a BMW 325i), but for 36K I 
got much more car for a little bit in 
terms of pickup and handling.
Saab's paid attention to small things 
like the two sunshades/visors. 
Controls are very ergonomic in 
addition. Cant say much about the 
reliabilty, i bought it on the 10th of 
july and have done only about 
400miles. Overall fun car.

superb with the 17"" wheels and the
Pirelli wide tires.  The feeling is
total and effortless control, especially
on winding Sierra mountain roads. 
Braking has perfect feel.  Ventilated
seats are a great plus in Sacramento
summer heat.  Seats fit like a glove.  I
test drove BMW 525 and Mercedes C sport
coupe and the Saab beats them both. What
understeer?

Turbo lag is there, but I'm not drag
racing, and when you kick it to merge or
 manuever on the highway it snaps nicely.

Before you buy a sport sedan, drive an
Aero.   "

least, I looked at the BMW 5 Series, 
Cadillac CTS and CTS-V, Accura TL, and 
they did not stack up. Saab Aero is in 
a class alone when considering value 
to dollar ROI. Handling is clean and 
crisp, fuel ecomony is running nearly 
24 MPG (highway/city). 17"" rims are 
very nice. Overall impression 
is, ""where has Saab been?"" We know 
Saab is owned by GM, but this group is

Compare to the other cars in the same 
price range (BMW 325, Audi A4, Lexus

sporty, nor the most refined, but it 
offers a unique stylying and lots of 
utility. The rear seat is spacious, and 
the trunk is like a cave compare to the 
BMW.  

SAAB uses high quality material through 
out the cabin. I still could not tell 
whether the door inserts are real 
leather or not. The seats are very 
comfortable, as well as the head 
restraint. "

The Aero option again is the only way to go on a Saab. Bigger tires and add the spoiler and the car goes from a plain Jane to the girl every bad boy wants. Power is there when you need to pass. My 96 was more sure footed but this model is more agile. The cabin updates for rear passengers was needed. The seats are comfortable but not like the 9000 Aero. As long as Saab is making cars I will be an owner.

Sweet Harmon-Kardon sound system, serious acceleration and cornering control, lots of room, excellent climate control, comfy (heated) seats, 29-30 MPG on trips (at 150K miles!), and a body solid enough to carry a load of cabinetry lumber (or 4 kayaks) on removable Thule racks!

It's just like your technology at home, when it goes it goes and there is no way to detect when it will go bad. Your mechanic can check the mechanics etc... , but the modules are another story.

Ten trips to the dealership, mostly for brake related problems (noise, vibration, ABS/TCS lights coming on). My nearest dealership is 100+ miles away, so major inconvenience. Today, check engine light came on, a week after getting it back from the shop. Typical story. In the car's defense, a lot of the trips are due to dealership/mechanic incompetence, but isn't that part of the package? I only recommend a 9-5 if you live near a dealership and they supply loaners, and you get extended warranty."

The power plant durability and the quick initial depreciation made these cars a great buy used. The reliability has gotten better from the first Saabs I owned (1979, 1985, 1986 and 1994), but all those were hatchbacks, and the '85, '86 were turbos. Saab got bland with the styling and that may have led to their downfall. (If they no longer were quirky, why bother?) But, the turbocharged 4 cylinder makes these cars the best hill climbers.

saab,9-5,2004,danducati, 08/21/2011,Stay Away Unless You Won the Lottery!,2,"OMG, what a piece of junk. Bought with 40K miles on it and had the check engine light go on after about 3 months. Cost $2,100 to fix it. Nice.

Then the grill flew off as I was driving down the highway.

Then it began leaking antifreeze like a sieve. Another $400 fix.

I have had enough and will never ever buy a Saab again! Traded that sucka in today for a Lexus and am now super happy."

it lacks in a sport suspension is made 
up for in superior ride comfort. You no

$38,000 you can't buy a roomier, 
faster, more functional mid-luxury 
vehicle. The 9-5Arc comes loaded with 
standard features that would be pricey 
options with any other maker. How many

come standard with heated and air 
conditioned front seats, assymetrical

372 miles and three days after 
delivery. I was in the desert and there 
is a dealer about 20 miles from our

Have taken (2) 500+ mile trips and am very happy with mileage, power, comfort and style. Both my wife and I think the car is very easy to drive. Great seats, good controls and easy to read gauges. Lots of storage room make this as easy to pack as our station wagon. We like the materials used in the interior and appreciate the room and soft touch of the space. On the road the car feels smaller than it is and the isolation over rough roads is wonderful. Transmission / engine well matched with plenty of go anytime it is needed.

that I leased and my main complaint 
about that one was its mushy handling.

The Aero wagon corrects that problem 
admirably.  It is very tight on the 
road and really hits its stride at 50 
mph and above speeds.  I had looked at 
the Volvo, BMW 5 series, and Audi 6 
series wagons and eliminated the BMW 
for cost issues, the Audi for repair 
record and the Volvo for handling.

better if they still offered a hatch. Power 
seems slightly better than my 2000 9-3 SE,

Drive the car in sport mode for a real

liked a car more.  It's comfortable, 
civilized, great ride - smooth without 
feeling mushy and give you a real sense

I can get 4 ice hockey bags in the 
trunk, 2 adults and 2 kids.  With the 
AT in SPORT mode, the car plain out

manual transmission for the wagon and got sports, 
function and fuel economy just before the gas $ 
went up.  We went to the auto show in NYC looking 
for a bmw or Audi and came out sure that the Saab 
95 Aero was the right vehicle.  This is the only car 
that felt right to my wife when she sat in it.  Saab 
has done a great job marketing this car to women

excellent. Kick to drive. Enormous

Great driver's car. Excellent passenger 
accommodations front and rear. 

All in all, an exellent value that

This is the most horse power I have had, felt I had power to maneuver when needed in traffic.  Gas economy is good for size of car it is.  When I have had passengers with me they have always commented what a nice ride they are having.  I agree that back seat is just about as comfortable as the front and plenty of leg room. I think you get a great value for the money.  Have had 2 minor recall issues I have had to get fixed.  One complaint is that covered maintenance is only at 5k, 15k, 30k and 45k.

I'll admit I have spent a few thousand dollars in repairs but mostly due to my own lack of understanding. I've had to replace cps, throttle body, a plastic window piece and maybe a few other odd parts. The transmission was the big problem though, I changed the input shaft seals and used advance auto recommended trans fluid, it ended up costing me 1850 for a rebuilt trans and trip to Ohio to have it installed. ONLY USE SAAB RECOMMENDED FLUIDS. It is surprisingly quick between 50 and 80, turbo lag sucks from the stoplight though. It handles decently and is a nice drive through the mountain roads here in WV. All in all it's a pretty good 13 year old car that I plan on having for a while. I'm definitely a fan and plan on modifying it to perform a little bit better while still carrying the kids to school.

It is SAFE, Fast and in Sport mode quick enough for most anyone but a real drag racer. Great through snow!  Factually if you are considering buying a used car and you do not check out the value at a SAAB dealer you are making a HUGE mistake!  It is probably best to get an extended warranty as it is really on any used car.  Both myself and my son are 6 foot 300 pound guys and  we can both sit comfortably in the front.  If you want a car that handles well, has panache, is FUN and SAFE.  Find a good used SAAB and YOU WILL BE IMPRESSED.  Great Dealer!"

It's comfy to drive in all weather conditions and roads. I do run snow tires in the winter and the car becomes unstoppable. I visit my dealer every 5k for sched maint and the car has never failed me. From weather of -20 to +115 dF, the car always handles it and with composure. The car is very understated in design which I like, doesn't call attention to its self in traffic. "
saab,9-5,2005,GeeWhiz, 04/09/2010,New to Saab,4,"I first drove a Saab 9-3 Aero , but it was sold, so I drove this 9-5 Arc.  The 9-5 Arc is more of a touring car and is larger and less sporty than the 9-3 Aero.  The ride is much smoother than the 9-3 Aero and the Interior is better designed.  I love this car - power on demand with the 2.3 L turbo and great gas mileage as long as you get out of city driving conditions.  Only owned a short time, but all the research seems to suggest that routine maintenance is key and Synthetic Oil changes every 4-5K miles is a must. "
saab,9-5,2005,G Anderson, 04/22/2005,A Swedish Study In Contrasts,5,"This is my first Saab, which I picked up after many years behind the wheel of various SUVs and a 4x4 truck.  I've raced cars in the past, so it has always seemed incongruous that I was an SUV driver.  I've finally made the jump to a luxury sport sedan, and I could not be happier with the 9-5 Aero.   The 9-5 exemplifies the Swedish design philosophy of refined understatement coupled with performance. Excellent road manners with enough stiffness in the ride to remind you that the car is made to handle and perform.  The 2.3 ltr Turbo provides an excellent balance of torquey performance and fuel economy, while at the same time making you forget that there's a little 4 banger under the hood."

I do a lot of highway driving (cape cod every weekend) Weekends i avg 300 miles and weekdays I drive about 500-700 and the car gobbles them all up with composure and confidence Some people will say Saabs are nothing but problems, but I find that if you actually maintain the car like you're suppose to, then not much will happen. This car has been wonderful to own. Its fast and agile, yet i avg 29-31 mpg on a regular basis. Great car for New England winters with snow tires of course. I plan on keeping this for a long time as it's holding up better than I expected. We also have a convertible and its just as good. "
saab,9-5,2005,GeeWhiz, 03/31/2010,"Performance, Comfort, and Fun to Drive!!",4,"Sink into these comfortable seats, turn the key in the console - hit the sport mode put into gear and take off -  you will feel why they say Saab born form jets.  All this and excellent fuel economy, especially on the open road.  Since I've only owned a short time - my personal experience with reliability is incomplete, sounds like following the maintenance schedule is key.  I fell in love with this car during the test drive."
saab,9-5,2005,sl, 03/20/2005,Saab 9-5 Arc,4,"This car handles like a dream, has the power needed in a quick start or emergency, but gets the gas mileage of a much less gutsy car.  "
saab,9-5,2005,Robert Green, 09/07/2008,Fine car but not bullet proof,4,"My wife is the primary driver, but we've both logged enough miles to form an opinion.  First, the good:  handling, acceleration, brakes, ride  comfort. Looks good in an understated way from all angles.  Love that tight turning circle. Wife loves the turbo boost, cargo space and six-way seat. 26-28 mpg with manual transmission. The midnight blue, she found, is not invisible to police radar however.  The not so good: ABS and water pumps failed, some headlight relay issues, rear ABS sensor/hub replaced. All under warranty. Road noise a bit high with Pirellis and replacement  Bridgestone Potenzas.  On balance we're aiming for 200K, but expect it will not be a cheap ride."
saab,9-5,2005,EBG, 02/07/2006,Bang for the Buck,5,"The 2005 9-5 Arc is a whole lot for a rather moderate price, compared to competitors. Reliability is first on the list and, although not the reason for purchasing the vehicle, gas economy is phenominal at 28+ MPG (combined city and highway). Road feel is superb and the way that saab manages to squeeze power out of a 4 cylinder engine in unbelievable. With the ""sport"" feature that comes standard, you can get the feel of driving a much more expensive sports car, although your fuel economy will suffer just a bit. I am pleased as can be with the vehicle!"

saab,9-5,2005,AERO DRIVER, 08/23/2005,An amazing car thus far,4,"Although in the two years that I have owned my SAAB 9-5 Aero I have had several reaccurring problems, like malfunctionning auto levelling headlamps, and a wiper failure.  Each and every time I step into it I am rewarded with an amazing driving experience, great power delivery, superior ergonomics.  This is the first car that I have been able to keep for more than six months."
saab,9-5,2005,LASaab, 11/11/2008,Excellent car so far & very good value,4,"2.5 years and 35,000 miles in LA traffic, and no real complaints.  A few minor service items, but the car has been very reliable (as was the 2001 that I had before it).  Superb highway cruiser.  Smooth & quiet, with good acceleration once you get over about 15 MPH.  Excellent value for the money. This was engineered to be a BMW 5 series competitor in its day, and the quality level is in that category."
saab,9-5,2005,keith, 03/13/2010,Gas milage much better than advertised,4,"I have owned my Saab for over 3 years.  Bought it used with 16k and have added another 30k.  Have spent zero on maint. Except oil changes.  Gas mileage is rated 17 city and 26 highway but I get 33 highway and 28 in mixed driving, not sure how to measure city.  No complaints so far.  Love the rear parking sensors.  Have an aero with spoiler so still looks good although over 5 years old.  Sport seats are comfortable. You feel the road which I like but my wife hates. Also rides low (same like/hate).  Harman Kardan sound is good but not amazing.  Trunk roomy.  Can't complain.  I know resale is low, but will prob. Give to my son at some point and I only paid $22k used so not too worried "
saab,9-5,2005,tahcan, 02/11/2005,wicked fun wagon,4,"I traded a G500 mercedes (which was a in the shop 41 days in the 8 months I owned it) on this great wagon which continues to amaze me everytime we stuff it full of stuff and still get in the high 20's on the highway. It is a manual which is a hoot to drive, it is excellent (with snow tires) in the fluffy stuff, handles very well, comfortable for 5 plus the dogs in back. I am not sure why there are not many more of these wagons out there. It kicks the volvo in turning radius by some 9 feet which is a major deal in city driving, bigger then the subaru, and i would not have considered another mercedes after the last one."
saab,9-5,2005,Disa, 06/14/2005,Expensive to keep,3,Saw the price list for Service at the Dealership. Will sell this car after the free service. Charging close to $1000.00 for a major service. And charges of $480 for minor service. That is pretty steep to change oil and fuilds on minor service and that does not include pads on brakes or belts and timing chains. You will pay for all the free service before. Not worth the car.
saab,9-5,2005,deacane, 12/29/2005,Saab 9-5 wagon did not disappoint,5,"Purchased based upon Consumer Reports ratings.  I wasn't crazy about the rims on the Arc, but I replaced them with 17-inch rims and Pirelli speed-rated tires, and the wagon is almost perfect.  Great car, great performance (7.0 0-60), and 32.5 mpg on the highway. What's not to love?"
saab,9-5,2005,Paul Perry, 10/09/2004,The Rodney Dangerfield of Cars,4,"This car never seems to get any respect
from reviewers.  However, after pooring
over the road and track reviews of this
particular class of cars the Saab 9.5
aero was the best value.  Saab had a
$5,000 sticker writeoff incentive at the
time.  Saab builds some of the safest
cars on the road today.  This car is
flat out the most  enjoyable car to
drive I have ever owned.  The list
includes Lexux, Volvo, and BMWs.    The
Aero with a stick makes you want to take
the car for a drive out in the country
just to exercise the car.  On long trips
the car is great because it has the most
 luggage space of any of the cars in its
class. To nit pick, I
would have to say the cup holder is not
""elegant."""
saab,9-5,2005,Saabhlic, 12/16/2004,9-5 Aero,5,"This is the vehicle that provides it 
all--performance, safety and comfort.  
I have found no better choice in the 
price range that the 9-5 Aero occupies. 
The Aero Academy (2-day driving school

cake.  I love my Aero!"
saab,9-5,2005,Khalid, 01/26/2005,Fast & safe,4,"This is the best vehicle I have ever owned. It handels well, especially in corners. impresive braking & all the Alphabits in it (ESP & ABS....) do work!The quality of the car is impresive so far.

saab,9-5,2005,Ken, 08/03/2005,New to Saab,5,"Awesome. Drive this against Audi, BMW, Lexus etc. If it's for you, there will be no comparison.  Once I drove it, had to have it. Never thought I would even look at Saab. "
saab,9-5,2005,Bryan B, 08/09/2005,I am a Fan So Far,5,"I love the look of this car, the wheels, the front grill, etc... with the black sport interior and the chrome style dash I think it is a great looking sporty car.  Highway driving and parkway driving -- best I have ever driven.  In and around town it is stiffer and you feel the potholes more than my wifes Arc wagon. Bottomline, I am very pleased so far."
saab,9-5,2005,martinigop, 08/22/2005,"Great Value, Sweet Swedish Ride!",4,"Just purchased a new 9-5 Aero after owning a 2003 BMW 525i for the past 3 years. My BMW corners better then the SAAB, but I find the 9-5 much more fun to drive. A comparably equipped 5 series is nearly $60K! Having driven both cars, the BMW is not enough better then then the 9-5 to justify the difference in price. The critics are dead wrong about this car. In my humble opinion I think its still one of of the best looking cars on the road. My SAAB turns far more heads then my BMW ever did. There are definitely a few quirky features on the 9-5, but I think it adds to the whole ""coolness factor"" of the car. If money is not a factor buy the BMW, otherwise save the bucks!"

Could use more cup holders and storage space in front seat. Doesn't do quite as well in snowy conditions as I'd hoped, but still reasonable.  Repair for run into deer involving front bumper was very expensive."

saab,9-5,2005,Rick, 07/16/2005,Another Saab,4,"This is our 4th Saab and believe it to be the best of the bunch.  We just stepped down from owning an Aero due to the requirement for premium gas.  The Arc only requires regular unleaded.  We do not find much difference in the Arcs ability versus the Aero.   However, we are not aggressive drivers anyway."
saab,9-5,2005,Stan18, 04/04/2005,Jack of all trades...,5,"Safe, fast, reliable, high utility (big trunk and enough interior space for 4 adults).  Handles nice.  Great gas mileage.  Outstanding car for the real world.  Ignore the critics (they don't live in the real world, and they don't like FWD.).  I just re-leased my 3rd one (never owned a Saab prior to my first 9-5)...  need I say more?At the prices you can negotiate (way below MSRP), they offfer great value.  "
saab,9-5,2005,chris, 12/28/2009,Happy so far,4,"I bought an Arc wagon off-lease; it is really an excellent value and a lot of car for the money. It has all the modern passive and active safety features, and feels very secure on the road. The Swedish seats are the most comfortable in the business. Super ride quality and excellent mileage on the freeway- this is a great commuter car. The suspension definitely favors ride over cornering, but the Saab is plenty responsive with quick steering and good feedback. The 2.3T motor is a torquey beast- it pulls from 40-70 mph in the blink of an eye. "
saab,9-5,2005,Chris Stevens, 07/07/2005,Glitches Anyone,4,"This is my first Saab and maybe my last.  I have numerous little annoying things take place.  Cruise control stopped wrking for a month, roll over gas tank valve failed - can't pump gas into it, inexplicable oil leak & resulting engine knock, failed starter module - would not start, Auto setting for AC does not work consistently.  But other than that the car has been great. 26k in 10mos on an 04 9-5 Wagon 2.3T.  The car drives great, suspension is softter than my wife's Volvo XC70 - I would prefer less dive & roll and firmer, but it drives beautifully and gets 28-29 mpg on my 110mile commute. My stock Pirelli P6's grip well and quite."
saab,9-5,2005,rgloriamay, 07/22/2005,my steel grey baby,4,went from 2002 se 9-3 to 9-5 arc.  love the solid feel and handling. i think it is a very pretty car and this is my fourth saab.  i feel very safe in it.  only draw back is premium gas and am getting only about 16 mpg in city driving.
saab,9-5,2005,Eric FitzGerald, 08/30/2005,Swedish Aspirations,5,"This car was an absolute steal at only $33k. Thanks to the employee pricing I got a top of the line 9-5 Aero for the price of a 9-3 Arc w/options or a 9-3 Aero w/ no options. The car is fast and people do look at it because it does look so good. Sure the handling isn't as precise as a BMW's or it's not a luxurious as other cars in this price class, but when compared to other $33k cars, there is no contest! I've always loved Saabs and having to tame the torque steer, lifting the ring to throw it in reverse and seeing the corner and reverse lights light up at the front corners. It's unique, it's fast, it sounds amazing and I love the turbo whisltes that accompany my commute every day."
saab,9-5,2005,Candy, 09/27/2005,Great GAS Milage,5,"I don't know where you got 19 city and 28 hwy, but I average 25-28 city and 33-35 hwy.  I have the 95 turbo and love it, just wish it was a convertable."
saab,9-5,2005,Brian, 10/20/2005,More good than bad,4,"Awesome car. After a few trips to the dealer for some very minor things, the Saab is great. My service is awesome. Driving the Saab is a great experiance. It is a highway car though. Sways in tight turns. But on the highway look out. Nothing but pure power."

My mom wanted me to have a Saab because thats all my whole family drives and I wanted something like a sports car because they're cute...but now that I have my car I love it so much...I was in an accident with a Saab 2 years ago and if we werent in that car we probably wouldnt have made it its such a great car I love my Saab!!!

happier. I made the choice when I 
purchased a used Saab for my son as a 
graduation present, Driving and riding 
in it, I realized what a great car this 
was. So, I made the move away from the 
big (politically irresponsible)SUV, to 
this grand, luxry sedan."

my 540i but hey its a Saab not a BMW. 
The style is one of the best on the 
market, not the box of volvo or the odd 
lines of the mercedes.  All in all, 
great car though it doesn't have the 
bells and whistles on the interior like 
some of the other luxury vehicles out 
there "

haven't had any problems with it other 
than taking it into dealer for service

raises the shift point rpms which really
gives it some punch.  The outside design
is understated and pedestrian, but the

has all of the most advanced computer
driving system enhancements.  Saab is in
trouble economically, so these can be
had with a large discount from the

what can I say.

So it having compared favorably, it is 
a much better value $$$.

delivery of Aero exceeds expectations.  
Seats are very supportive.  
Financially, a very attractive package

I've got two other Saabs (900S)with over 400.000 miles as well as a 1999 Saab 9-5 with 168,000 miles.

Was a little nervous about stepping down in power and style, but found this car to be better balanced than the Aero. The lighter pressure turbo is smoother and the handling is much more predictable (the Aero model needs bigger sway bars and is skittish at edge of adhesion). This car is much more comfortable but still has me grinning when I want to drive at a good clip! I have not had ANY problems with ANY of my Saabs."
saab,9-5,2005,Dan Schilling, 03/23/2005,Fun to drive,5,This is a great car!  Plenty of power and it sips gas.  The rear seat is one of only a few cars that has a  comfortable seating position.  What more could you want from a sport sedan.

I've never had a car that offers so much performance and economy along with comfort and a reasonable price. Saab should do more to promote the 9-5, it really is alot of car for the money. I'm sure it would be a best seller if it was available in All-Wheel-Drive"

Smooth ride, tight handling, decent acceleration, especially from 40-70mph. Great highway car. This one has been reliable, but I recommend that you have a good Indy Saab shop to keep it in good shape. For short money I get to drive a european luxury car with all the options."

THIS IS IT!  Super comfortable seats (sports pkg seats are even better than the std ones), and adjustable (in & out + up/dn) steering wheel fit her perfectly.  And, at only 5'-2"" she can now reach the gas pedal & still be a safe distance from the steering wheel's air bag.  The car has LOTS of other features we didn't expect, like super fast turbo acceleration, the seat air blowers, a GREAT stereo, and rather low, easy access to load from the rear door. And, it's almost as fun to drive as my Mini.  Overall, it's simply the best car we've ever had - and we've had a LOT."

As long as I drive normal - very comfortable with great sound system sunroof open has no cabin buffet - wagon design very useful with kids. Regarding vibration complaints in other reviews, this is a 4 cyl putting out 260HP - you want an appliance, buy something else. Great used value!"

This car is meant to be driven so hang on (esp. Sports mode) - you'll feel the G force! Tremendous acceleration, agility, cargo, brakes and sound (Harman-Kardon).  Drinks regular gas & retains performance.  Recommend the Aero (Sports) & Safety Pack - best value, everything except GPS.  Great reliability. Only con: could use a bit more upgraded interior.  Prev car: BMW-5 350i Euro. "

Great ride with plenty of power. This unique 4 cylinder gives great gas mileage (34 MPG at 65-70 mph) and has the power to move  out at interstate passing speeds. Don't have to pay top dollars for a great car. Styling is classy and you don't see many Saab 9-5s on the road. A great car which I highly recommend."
saab,9-5,2006,Mendelation, 08/09/2016,"164,000 miles, original owner",4,"Bought the 9-5 new in January 2007 with major incentives. Initially concerned due to a number of little things that kept me coming back to the dealer. Eventually, all this was taken care of under warranty. Overall, reliability has been outstanding. 164K now with no engine problems and no transmission issues. Car has been solid for almost ten years. Drove cross country and achieved 32 mpg overall for the trip. Consistently got 28 mpg on 70/30 mix of highway/city driving. Original brakes lasted to 150,000 miles and could have gone a little more. Still has lots of vibration at idle but this is inherent in all 9-5s with the 2.3L turbo. Overall, I am very pleased with how this Saab has served me.
"
saab,9-5,2006,carguy, 12/19/2005,needs all wheel drive,4,"Although this car is front wheel drive, it was fun to drive. I have owned several Saabs, and this 9-5 drove as good or better then all of them. Saabs are known for their torque, and the new 2.3 turbo was strong from second gear on up (first gear was weak). Unfortunately, there is still torque steer under hard acceleration (negative of front wheel drive cars). Seats were very supported and comfortable, stereo was very good, it shifted smoothly, and handled well. If Saab made this all wheel drive, they would have an awesome car to compete with the best from Europe, the front wheel drive on this car stops it from measurng up to other sport sedans. Over all, for the money, its a fun, comfortable car"
saab,9-5,2006,David, 11/15/2006,Excellent balance of family and sport,4,"Since acquisition, the car has performed perfectly.  Driving in city, on highway, and through mountains, and there is no appreciable difference in performance.  Plenty of space for three kids in the back, and comfort over long distances for two kids in the front.  Cockpit is extremely well balanced on driver side - everything is accessible (though the cruise control is more appropriate to an airliner than a car!).  Dual temperature zones have driver and passenger happy.  Auto/memory seating and mirror position saves time between driver changes.  The car has more acceleration than it should as a wagon, and is an excellent balance between a family and sport vehicle.  It's an outstanding value."

Then I discovered the 9-5. The best look of 'this' side of most exotic Italian cars. Best balance of ride and comfort. Super smart engineering.   9-5 is smarter than you - make sure you read the manual and break in carefully. Only MB & Saab made through 1 mln mile mark. Quality piece of machinery. Every unique feature has a purpose. "
saab,9-5,2006,nediamnori, 02/08/2010,Beautiful Car,5,"Pictures do not do this car justice. I love the fact they dont look the same as most vehicles. So what if they look like a ""SAAB"". Thats what I want. You can spend the same on a used Pontiac but I gurantee most SAAB's are kept up way better because the owners LOVE them so much. I love cleaning and caring for it. The little quirks u may find ""annoying"" I love. What cars have a cup holder(s) like a Saab 9-5 ? The trunk is huge. Its a common sense great vehicle. 5 stars"

I love my new saab.  while not as well gadgeted inside, it is really sporty and fun to drive.  Anyway the saab is fun to drive unlike any other wagon i've driven and is sporty looking too.  I liked my car so much I bought a 9-3 convertible  to go with it! "
saab,9-5,2006,speeedy94, 11/30/2006,New Saab Fan,5,"Overall a fantastic sedan. Original classic styling. Drive quality is a wonderful blend of luxury and sportiness. European drive and styling. High quality feel throughout interior. More room inside than other sedans of similar price. Also not all over the road like Acura Tl, Infiniti G-35, Lexus ES 350, BMW 3 series , Mercedes C-class or Audi A-4. I did consider all of the sedans above but I'm glad I went for the underated Saab.

saab,9-5,2006,charles pinnick, 02/06/2009,More rattles than a box of biscuits,4,Lovely car for the price but unfortunately I bought it new and could not get much of a deal.  I am a slender 170lbs yet the cushion bottom on my leather ventilated sport-seats has gone nearly flat and I am sitting on the frame.  Dealership said they fixed it by putting a new one in (and billing Saab no doubt) but I believe they simply turned it over and puffed it out.  Bad for the back - and that is one of the reasons I bought my second Saab 9-5.  The rattles on this car KILL me.  The plastics are low-grade economy plastics and there are more rattles in this new design than there were in the older vehicle.  These new vintages suffer from shoddier plastics--Saab says 1 yr on rattles-bs!
saab,9-5,2006,kevin, 02/06/2006,"Great car, great value",4,"I've always had Volvo wagons but decided to try a Saab this time around. Went in to look at the 9-3 when I saw the new 9-5. I was sold from the test drive. It's impressively powerful, more so than my previous V70 T5. The seats are comfortable and there is a lot of space in the wagon area. The back seat is also roomy. But the best part is the price. I paid less than 40 grand for what cost about 45 grand on my Volvo and over 50 on any other luxury make. The 9-5 Sport Combi makes more sense than an SUV if you don't need the all-wheel drive and it is far more stylish."
saab,9-5,2006,Chris, 04/25/2006,Saab 9-5 Aero,4,"I originally was planning on leasing a new 9-3 Aero due to a mostly satisfying experience with a 2003 9-3 Linear Sedan; however, I chose the 9-5 Aero because of its redesigned exterior and superior test-drive performance. There's a nice balance of comfort, handling and performance with the 9-5.  The marriage of the car to the 2.3 L engine provides ample power with nice fuel economy.  I've been very impressed with the interior comfort and design. Gauges are straight-forward. HVAC controls are simple,  Leather, ventilated bucket seats are comfortable and pratical for hot temp climates.  "
saab,9-5,2006,Mathieu, 03/08/2006,Best Wagon Value,4,"After a week with the Saab I have to say that I am very impressed with the performance and comfort. And let me tell you, it turns heads.. Its styling is unique is defintely one of the best looking sports wagon out there."
saab,9-5,2006,Mike Hoggan, 08/24/2006,Fabulous Car! Terrible cup holders!,4,"Love exterior design of our 95.  Not a lot of them on the road, so it's unique and gets a lot of attention.  The 2.3 L turbo is thrilling powerhouse with excellent excelleration, especially in Sport mode. Handling terrific, color, quality & design of interior materials great. But some wind noise and annoying rattle that has developed in moon roof that dealership service now tells us is common problem with 95 but very annoying in car this price - we are determined this will be fixed. "
saab,9-5,2006,Patrick, 08/27/2006,Great Car,4,Traded in our 00' 9-5. Very fun car to drive. We drove competitors and found the Saab to be the best car for the price.
saab,9-5,2006,hr, 10/14/2006,It's still a Saab!,4,"There is one thing that reviews consistently fail to mention about the SAAB driving experience; it feels SAFE! I've owned Mercedes, BMW, and VW and only my early 90's S class Mercedes gave me the same feeling. Even the electric door locks have a reassuring thunk that makes me think of a deadbolt engaging dorr jamb. I often see mention of turbo lag. Please explain how a 2.3 liter 4 cyl automatic in a 3600 lb car can chirp the tires on full throttle takeoff if there is turbo lag. I take my foot off the brake, nail it, it chirps and the traction control kicks in. If there is lag it's in milliseconds. I don't need 6 cylinders and I am getting 23 mpg around town. "
saab,9-5,2006,nelsoncm, 04/11/2007,Second Saab wagon,4,"It's a nice car for a small family of 3, plus 1 dog.  The 06 ride is fairly smooth (for a Saab) and as always, wonderful on the freeway.  What brought me back to Saab for a second time was the comfy, supportive seats.  Unlike Volvo, headrest is adjustable, which is nice when you're short.  All the amenities are here, heated seats, satellite radio, moonroof.  Roomier back seat than many other wagons.  Decent warranty.  Only one problem in first 6 months, a faulty airbag sensor, which was fixed under warranty.  Because it's a 4-cyl, gets great mileage.  They manage to get 260 hp out of this little engine, so it moves, though there is more turbo lag than in my old v-6. "
saab,9-5,2006,Andrew Nation, 10/25/2017,"Now, best 9-5 Saab ever",5,"year: 2006
model: 9-5 Sport sedan
5-speed manual
year purchased : 2011
mileage @ purchase : 34k
present mileage, spring 2020: 100k
2006 9-5 Sport sedan new upgrades since last entry:that featured Maptun S/W upgrade (State of 9) :

A) short throw manual shift gate..OK but requires very positive, delibetate & forceful shifting to ensure no miss-shifts 
B) 3M black  carbon fiber dash+center console + other inserts ...very thick, 100% precision cut to <1mm I think...Looks factory installed yet if you take your time it is very reasonable to install. I didn't install all the small stuff..would have llooked  too busy and a bit dorky.  Well worth the ~400 bucks. Car interior is black with black perforated leather, very contoured seats, with  ventilated cooling/heat. Sorry, but the interior is way nicer and comfortable than Aero model (what's with those ""penguin"" hard seats?). The 3M dash components kit is one of most professional accessories I've invested in for any Saab. Great complement to black interior.
C) BSR stainless exhaust. Fantastic ! 
Well worth the extra few hundred bucks!
Total system replacement from flex pipe aft. Larger diameter (+ a few hp?,), beautiful heavy-duty polished s.s. exhaust tip. Muffler is flat black, all components heavier duty than orig. Plus wonderful Italian (Maserati) musical exhaust sound. A work of art..Too bad the entire system except tip is hidden from view.
D) Conintental Extreme Contact tires. I would have preferred Pure Contact model but here in New England some states have terrible secondary roads and lanes.  EC model sidewalls are not as stiff as PureC model yet I need relief on these roads.  Also the uncommon times I use this car in light snow, the EC model is more apprpropriate, with special, deeper tread pattern on corners of the tires

saab,9-5,2006,never again Saab/GM, 03/04/2008,My new Saab was designed by 16 amateurs,1,"After first few thousand miles the car began to disintegrate and deteriorate, forcing me to spend 2-3 times a month in a dealer shop; with each repair lasting 3-4 hours. The roof, body, upholstery, front panel, and doors trim rattling and noises are getting intolerable with adding passengers; giving the impression the car will loose pieces or break apart. On cold days doors would not close/lock. Hinges must be lubricated and tied up every 1K miles. Driver seat and steering vibrates at idling. The car occasionally pulling sharply to the left. Terrible 16-18 mpg on hwy. Car is difficult to fix, new problems introduced with every repair. Have to wait 30 days for new parts; Saab offer no loaners"
saab,9-5,2006,Daniel, 11/12/2008,Great Value,4,"I've owned this car for 2 months and compared to 5 Series BMWs, Mercedes E Class, and the Audi A6, Saab gives you more car for the money"
saab,9-5,2006,Derreck, 02/24/2009,"Old Design, But Still Works",4,"Bought this vehicle used.  Was a GMAC off lease vehicle with only 23,000 miles.  Love that I don't see many on the road.  I understand that this car is basically the same as it was 10 years ago, but it is fun to drive and feels very solid and still looks modern.  It's too bad SAAB is in so much financial trouble.  I believe had they priced their vehicles more in the VW range instead of the BMW range they would have sold in much greater numbers and turned a profit."
saab,9-5,2006,Craig, 04/21/2009,Second Saab Wagon,5,"Bought this to replace my 2001 95 Aero wagon which had 118,000 miles. Lots of progress in the evolution of the car. More comfortable, but still handling and performing great. I drive from Ct. to NYC frequently, and appreciate a nice car that still gets good gas mileage. I am very happy in this car, even if I am stuck in traffic."
saab,9-5,2006,Mendelation, 09/07/2009,"A Mixed Bag-Fun, Economical but Fragile",3,"There's a lot to like in this car. Good combination of power and fuel economy. Lots of room in the interior and trunk. Unique car that you don't see everyday. However, the quality leaves much to be desired. The engine at idle send vibrations through the whole car and lots of interior pieces now vibrate. Lots of wind noise. Air bag problems, sun roof rattle problems, loss of coolant on trip, gas gauge failure. I worry about the long term durability of this car."
saab,9-5,2006,darryl greer, 02/04/2006,"2006 9-5 good, but could be better",4,"I just put my first 1000 miles on the new 9-5, having recently turned in a 2003 9-5 Arc with 50,000 miles, (flawless mechanical record). Good news is that the car is largely unchanged in handling and ride. Braking and headlights are superior.  Yet the 2.3L four is much rougher than the old V-6, with noticable turbo-lag and torque steer. The updated dash is improved, but Saab uses cheaper materials inside, below prior quality. Seating remains the same- comfortable;and ventilation has improved. Overall, the car like previous 9-5s seems at its best  cruising at higher speeds, and on extended  highway drives, resulting in a smooth, safe and secure ride with performance and comfort."

I like the redesigned interior and exterior, and it has increased horsepower. Fun to drive. Comare with any other Euro Wagon. More car, less money."
saab,9-5,2006,tbruce, 01/13/2006,Great car,5,I've had my 2006 for about two weeks now. I traded in my 2003 Aero. My 2003 was great (just wanted a new one). I love the 9-5. Has all the comforts and amenities I need in a car. Great price also when compare to the Euro competetion. My Saab went to the dealer maybe twice a year for very minor things. Torque steer is was not noticeable untill you really pushed the car.
saab,9-5,2006,saabster, 01/27/2006,Great car,5,"This is my second Saab 9-5 Aero (previous was a 2003). I like the new materials used inside the cabin. Finally, standard XM radio/CD changer.

saab,9-5,2006,AX, 01/28/2006,Surprisingly Fun,4,"I test drove BMWs, Volkswagen, and Mercedes, but leased the Saab 2006, sports with 5 speed manual.  The competition is more refined in most areas, but cant compete with the overall value (at least $100 less per month than competition).  I preferred the manual to the automatic version of 9-5 Saab, as the manual is more in tune with the road, with less front torque pull.  It is surprisingly fun to drive, even when compared to comparable competition, even if not as powerful.  The seats are probably better than competition.  Additionally, XM is a pleasure. Rated very high for safety."

saab,9-5,2006,clg, 01/10/2007,Amazing car for the price!,5,"The 2006 Saab 9-5 is a WHOLE lot of car for its price and an amazing sports sedan/highway cruiser.  Most optional features that get quite expensive on other cars come standard on the 9-5 including seat/mirror memory buttons, dual power seats, heated front & rear seats, in-dash 6 cd changer.  Comfy and easy to use interior that is great for traveling even long distances with 4 people.  Great performance - it's scary how much pull this engine has.  Floor it to 80 mph and it feels like the 9-5 isn't even breathing hard, plus you feel like you're only traveling about 55 mph!  Yes, there's a bit of torque steer if you floor it but, hey, I think that makes the car a bit more exciting to drive :) "
saab,9-5,2006,Bob, 01/24/2007,Affordable luxury,4,"One of best choices for a wagon if you need comfort and don't want to pay big $. The only reason to go for MB or BMW is RWD but everything else is right here. This car is even cheaper than Volvo, not that harsh to drive like Subaru Legacy."
saab,9-5,2006,SaabNY, 02/08/2007,Underestimated,4,"I purchased my 2006 9-5 with end of year  incentives. We already had a Saab 9-3 in the family which we like a lot. I'm very happy stepping up to the 9-5. Similiar understated luxury but with better interior quality and design. I now have 10,000 miles and zero problems. The 9-5 may not be the most modern car on the road but I think the long production run has given Saab a chance to refine the platform and fix a lot of early production issues. Despite some GM parts, the 9-5 still has lots of Saab feel and luckily manages to NOT feel like any GM vehicle that I've ever driven."
saab,9-5,2006,godango, 02/15/2007,Great Family Car,4,"When shopping for a new car, we knew we wanted a wagon for economy, easy of use and sporty drive (cross-overs are still bulky SUVs in sheep's clothing). Among wagons, the Saab really stood out. Great style and hands down the most comfortable seats bar none. We used the new Saab  on our drive to Florida from Ohio. The Saab rocked - excellent acceleration on the highway and great handling through the West Virginia mountains  in heavy rain. The car felt safe and secure on the road. The turbo 4 had plenty of juice for passing and climbing - the V6 complaint is just silly. The car also has done really well with all the snow this winter with the traction control doing its job."
saab,9-5,2006,saabie, 02/19/2007,Great value and fun to drive!,5,This is my 10th Saab and I really can't seem to drive anything else and enjoy it. This is my first 9-5 and I love it! Tremendous acceleration and handling with very little gas mileage loss. Much better sound system than my 9-3 Linear. End of the year savings made this an absolute steal!
saab,9-5,2006,AZJim, 04/29/2007,Saab 9-5 Combi,4,Wasn't even considering Saab. Found out about the deals on 2006 models and went to check them out. Found one of only 3 2006 SportCombi's left in AZ. Test drove it and fell in love. This wagon hugs the road and is mighty quick.The ventilated seats are awesome  especially here in AZ!! Sentronic is fun. Great sound system and loads of cargo space. Love It!!!
saab,9-5,2006,ChrisG, 05/17/2007,Excellent Value and Performance,5,"I have owned my 9-5 for 6 months now and still love it as much as the day I drove it home.  For me, there's no other car out right now that provides the same balance of value, performance, COMFORT, fuel economy and style.  The 9-5 in Sport Mode makes any trip fun, as when you stomp on the gas the car just squats down and launches.  A warning, though, 75 mph feels like about 50 so make sure to set the cruise.  I also love the fact that I can haul 3 other adults on long road trips and get nothing but compliments on the interior comfort. Passengers especially love the heated rear seats in the winter.  "
saab,9-5,2006,Ron L, 09/25/2007,Nice ride,4,"Nice ride, fine fuel economy for a car with this power and room inside. Great car for a sales person who is in the  car all day. I am loving this car! I live in Canada and run with 4 snows in winter and the car is safe and sound in ice and snow. ABS, ESP make for a nice combo on the ice covered roads.     "
saab,9-5,2006,BeefaBoy, 05/21/2007,SPAAB 9-5 Sport-Combi,4,"We call this thing the Spaab, it's like being at a day spa. I've been interested in Saabs since the early 80s when I was stationed in Germany, always loved their quirky styling.  This is my first and it's an incredibly comfortable and capable vehicle.  Fantastic acceleration and handling. Very roomy and well designed interior.  There's a bit of acceleration steer when you really jump on it, but this car inspires you to just take it easy and enjoy the ride so not much of that anyway. I have however had it up over 110 MPH and you would never know unless you gazed at the speedometer.  I have thought about getting rid of all my other cars and getting another Saab, maybe the 9-3 convertible!"

saab,9-5,2006,vtliving, 04/06/2008,9-5 Saab Owner Review,4,"I have owned and driven Saab vehicles for decades. From the Saab 900 to this current model - the 9-5 sedan. This is the best built and best handling Saab I have ever owned. The GM marriage seems to have improved overall quality in several key areas; climate control for one - now first rate quality. This car is roomy, responsive and fun to drive. The Front wheel drive and traction control make this vehicle exceptional in snow and winter driving conditions. I put on four studded snow tires and can safely go where ANY 4x4 can travel, up mountain roads and through ice and snow covered terrain. "

saab,9-5,2007,ultimate95aero, 07/12/2014,A Very Safe and Reliable Sports Sedan,4,"My 2007 Saab 9-5 2.3T Arc is a great car to own and really fun to drive. It's a great ""everyday"" driving car, and the turbocharged Inline-4 can make accelerating and passing folks a blast. Some people know about Saab's dedication to safety, and this car is no exception. It comes standard with plenty of airbags for everyone, very comfy seats with advanced seat belt restraints and safety systems, and a parking assist system that is optional on each 9-5 model. As for reliability, I have had no major issues (knock on wood), just a few normal maintenance items here and there. A list is provided below. (I would highly suggest only buying OEM replacement parts - 3rd Party Parts will generally last less than 1/3 of the time listed below) [*WARNING*: These are ONLY estimates and with NO labor included unless noted] 

FULL Synthetic Oil Changes (Every 6K Miles @ $40)
Coolant Bypass Valve (Every 40K Miles @ $20)
Gas Cap (Every 50K Miles @ $20)
Automatic Transmission Fluid (3309 ATF) (Every 60K Miles @ $60)
Direct Ignition Cassette and new Spark Plugs (Every 60-80K Miles @ $450)
Crankshaft Postiion Sensor (Every 80K Miles @ $80)
Throttle Body Assembly (Every 100K Miles @ $550)
Tires are around $780 (alignment and labor included) for decent all-season tires (235/45R17) (Every 40K Miles)
ESTIMATED TOTAL Maintenance Per 100K Miles = $3,420-$5,000
 
These are the replacements I've done myself so far but I know I will NEED to replace the fuel pump around 100K Miles ($900 plus labor). These replacements and the overall preventative maintenance for the 9-5 car are quite inexpensive in the long run compared to other automobiles (especially the German type). The most important thing to remember is that the Trionic 7 Engine Management System is one of the most advanced EMS ever developed, so you will know exactly what you need fixed if/when the Engine Light comes on. The instrument display and entire car also has few ""Saabish"" (neat) items to show off.  I am proud to say that I own and drive a Saab, especially a Saab 9-5.
"
saab,9-5,2007,tbill2, 08/22/2011,Poor man's luxury sport,4,"For some reason there are a glut of these 9-5s off-lease and available at reasonable prices.
I'm basically happy with mine, it's been reliable, a good and economical performer although mine is plagued with the same as others gripe about; harsh ride at slower speeds and a persistent rattle. The turbo provides abundant acceleration (sport mode is a blast) and the car is a dream to drive in tight x-way traffic.
It has the best brakes I've ever experienced, very comfortable seats, excellent sound system, and it looks classy (IMO).
My Saab dealer has also been responsive thus far.
No real worries.

Update Jan 2016.  Bought new tires (Bridgestone Turanza Serenity Plus) to replace the older Firestones which were the source of all the noise.  Once balanced properly, these new tires reduced the road noise and upgraded the ride and feel significantly.  It was like getting a new car.  This car is a wonder from 60 - 85 mph.  Smooth and responsive.  Now 96,500 miles, only regular service.

saab,9-5,2007,chgoguy11, 07/03/2011,2007 Saab 95 Wagon,5,"Love the 2.3 turbo engine, very brisk especially in Sport mode, but very economical too. Smooth ride, very comfortable seats, could drive this all day long. I had a 2001 95 wagon up to 112,000 miles and was still going strong.
Saab made many improvements over the years, while keeping things that work well. Gone are the wanky Info panel and Climate panel with the disappearing numbers. They kept the stalwart 2.3 turbo and updated the styling just enough to make it modern but still look like a Saab. I will keep buying Saabs!"
saab,9-5,2007,Daniel , 05/11/2009,Still a Head-Turner!,4,"Fourth Saab.  Very happy with the car overall.  I like the old dashboard better from 1999-2005 (Seems more classic Saab than GM).  Nice ownership experience from Saab, bought me back from Subaru. "
saab,9-5,2007,Acura-man, 04/07/2010,Fun and practical vehicle,4,"I traded in my 2007 Honda Pilot for this wagon in Jan 2010 - vehicle only had 15k miles on it.  I haven't been disappointed.  Although I did lose a lot of room, this car is just so much more practical and convenient.  It was a pain to load my bikes onto the SUV, but this roof-line is lower and easier to do; I also have a canoe  (yeah, you don't see many Saab owners driving around with canoes!) - also much easier to load.  The car is solid, fun to drive, and comes standard with so many features.  I also have a 2007 Acura (and have always had Honda), so it's a new experience to drive the Saab.  It's extremely fast, great styling, and many of the features seem a-ha (like the dual sunshades)."
saab,9-5,2007,Curt, 06/14/2008,My favorite car of all time!,5,"I've had this car for nearly a year and I love it!  It's powerful, comfortable and gets very good gas mileage.  The car is loaded with features and is designed with safety in mind.  This car offers so much value for the dollar.  I traded-in a Jaguar XK8 for this Aero and I have never regretted the decision.  This car is great in the snow and hauls five passengers quite comfortably.  The trunk is very large and the interior is well laid out.  This is my favorite car I've ever owned."
saab,9-5,2007,Bluewater 42, 06/28/2007,Combi is well named,4,"I like this wagon. It offers a ton of space for trips to the recycling center or the boat or 2 dogs and a blast around town, back roads, and the highway. If you're in the market for a mid-size wagon, and you like european brands, you'll find a huge price variance between this and and a BMW, MB or Audi wagon. My wife has a 2.5T V70, very similar but a bore to drive. She loves driving the Aero, wants to swap cars. The engine is plenty powerful and it corners flat as my buddies 2001 530 Bimmer. I would recommend this car for someone needing a combination sport sedan/SUV. Tried 9.3 Combi, too small but nice wagon too."
saab,9-5,2007,veadp, 05/16/2013,Do Not Buy Unless You're Rich!,3,"I have a 2007 Saab 9-5 Aero with Automatic Transmission. It has 93,000km.
Do Not Buy This Car Unless Money Grows On Trees For You!
If the car is working, it's a joy to drive, extremely comfortable, nice and responsive, with just enough power. 
However, this car is known for Ignition Coil Issues and Fuel Pump Issues, among other things.
Normally, these parts are readily available and relatively inexpensive to replace, however, Saab just had to be like BMW, Benz and Audi and the cost to replace parts are ridiculously Expensive and Only the OEM parts will work!
I had to replace the Igntion Coils ($500), the MAF Sensor ($250) and Fuel Pump ($500).
And the car still doesn't work properly!"
saab,9-5,2007,gummibear, 04/22/2009,Best Bang for Buck,4,"People too often make the mistake of comparing the 9-5 with top luxury car makers (BMW, Audi, Lex, etc). The only problem is that such a comparison doesn't take into consideration that those cars cost at least $20-30k more when you start factoring comparable extras. In its price class the Saab 9-5 is simply the best value offering sporty power and handling, great comfort (seats + interior roominess), decent gas mileage and a unique design.  Really this car is equal parts fun and functional.  While the 2.3L turbo takes you 0-60mph in 6.7s, what is really impressive is how it performs in its unique power band (40-70mph).  In that range you are accelerating faster than a Porsche 911 Carrera."
saab,9-5,2007,aubrey, 07/29/2009,A distinct vehicle,5,"Totally enjoy the vehicle after going through two BMWs. The handling is terrific and I am totally surprised at the mileage - 21 city and 30 to 33 on highway. It has more than adequate power and rides nicely. Could improve on the cup holder. Add one. A distinct looking vehicle, particularly in black. "
saab,9-5,2007,cedric long, 06/24/2007,Value,4,"This is my 3rd Saab 9-5 and they continue to impress with strong performance, very reliable, and excellent fuel mileage.  Seats are extremely supportive and build quality has been very good.  It's always interesting when you read the automotive reviews the Saab 9-5 is rated significantly below the competition.  But when you drive the car it proves to be quite comfortable and with 260 HP certainly competitive with today's competition.  The turbo is a completely different driving experience and makes the vehicle fun to drive.  Fuel mileage at 22 mpg around town and 32+ on the highways makes the 4 cylinder an excellent choice with today's high cost of fuel.  "
saab,9-5,2007,msimpson, 05/29/2007,Great Car and Value,5,"I went from a large SUV to the 2007 9-5 Aero Sport Wagon roughly four weeks ago. Great decision on my part. I thoroughly checked out all the so-called competition and I felt the Saab wagon 9-5 won hands down. The lower cost vehicles just didn't compare and the higher cost vehicles didn't have anywhere near enough added value in order to justify the substantial extra cost. One might say that all wheel drive is a must, but I find the front wheel drive is just fine and you benefit from added gas mileage as well. I'm extremely pleased with the car overall. I don't live at the gas station anymore. Comfort is great and it handles like a sports car. The cargo area is bigger than anything in its class."
saab,9-5,2007,donaldtrump, 07/21/2013,I'm a real wannabe Saab guy,5,"I love my Saab.
I don't care much about stuff, but my Saab has captured my heart and won't let go.
I'm writing this review today because I just crashed my Saab and it's at the body shop being assessed.
It's possible my Saab won't make it.
Prayers accepted."

Love the look and the sunroof.  3 different transmission settings allow for a fun and responsive drive.  So far, I'm sold on a SAAB. Free 36 month maintenance sure is nice.  As said in manual, gas mileage improves as car is broken in.  I've gone from 23 to 26 now.  Mobile One and 93 Octane is used."
saab,9-5,2007,SAAB95JD, 08/12/2007,If you like quirky this is it!,4,"I bought a 2007 Saab 9-5 after losing my 300K Mercedes E300D due to a flooded street.  It was difficult to choose a car other than another Mercedes, but let's face it... if you want a M-B diesel the minimum price is $60K!  So, I chose to go with something else unusual, and the Saab fit the bill.  What a great car!  The acceleration is thrilling, the build seems great, the interior is comfortable and well thought out, and I LOVE the fact that the parchment seats are combined with black interior colors.  Very modern.  The car has had one warranty claim already which is why I rated it 9 instead of 10... but it was a simple squeak in the wood trim.  It took the dealer 10 min to fix."
saab,9-5,2007,Tiff, 07/02/2007,"My fifth one, and the best one",4,"This is my fifth 9-5 and I think it's the best one I've owned. I have always loved the comfortable seats, the well-designed dash and the rather eccentric turbo engine, but the new one finally has satellite radio, a cd changer, and tons of power. It's comfortable on long drives and still has room for four or five people and their luggage. And while newer designs may offer more toys, they come at a price."
saab,9-5,2007,annm, 05/03/2008,"Wagon? yes, but it's a sport's car, too",5,"Could not love driving a car more than this!  The manual transmission is fun to drive. The Aero is agile & responsive. While there are cars on the highway that are attractive style-wise, I bought the Aero wagon because I wanted a manual. Not too many manuals out there in cars this size. And not too many wagons."
saab,9-5,2007,Eric Burt, 02/16/2010,Fun to Drive,5,"I decided to buy this car (a 2007 w/ 45,000 miles)- over the 2007 Honda Accord & 2007 Toyota Camry -after test driving all three. This car is the best ride of all three - by a long shot. It's the most fun I've ever had driving a vehicle - it has great power - 260 HP w/ turbo- and a smooth, quiet ride. Better ride than my wife's Mercedes- Benz ML 340. Long live SAAB !"
saab,9-5,2007,Mourer, 05/05/2007,Never been more disappointed,2,"It's my 39th new car.  I've owned most all types.  This car is my biggest disappointment since purchasing GM's & Fords in the 80's.  Owned 2 days and the side ""memory seat"" lower seat wrap around and buttons have broken off the drivers seat and just hanging, parts on order.  Low gas mileage for such a tiny tiny engine...if 2.3L were in a Honda it would get 45 MPG, not 18.  So with what's happened in day 2 of owning it, I look forward each morning to what will break next.  Other cars offer greater value, quality, at lower costs.  Don't buy a SAAB!!!  Big mistake."
saab,9-5,2007,stvakr, 04/20/2007,Saab Air Gulper,5,"Brisk acceleration and very fun to drive especially on the highway.  Spacious midsize sedan that seats four adults comfortably with a huge trunk, sporty design and feel, and thumping sounding stereo system.  When the transmission is shifted to the ""sport"" mode, the fun meter goes up.  With the large oversized gripping Pirelli's, the front end steering torque is definitely noticeable. "
saab,9-5,2007,Denver Aero, 05/01/2007,Value sport,4,"Great highway cruiser and the new suspension is very adept in corners. Compares in price to the 300 bmw series, but is larger. I've enjoyed the sport-tuned suspension. Saab owners are used to the higher power band, so no biggie that first gear isn't much. It's a thriller to drive and own. I've enjoyed it and it's surprisingly practical. I have lots of warranty protection, but this build quality is much better than my 96 900SE. No hint of any probs yet. Realistically to get a car 4 people could fit in would cost me $45,000- 50,000 after options."
saab,9-5,2007,JC, 06/05/2007,A surprisingly good car,4,"People who drive a BMW, Audi, or Mercedes will probably not be amazed by the Saab 9-5. No, it doesn't have a high-tech computer in it that merely complicates simple tasks, and no it doesn't have ""active steering"" or anything like that. But it's a hugely comfortable and powerful car that will haul a ton of stuff in the wagon model. It is actually comfortable for five people, and is well built and attractive in an odd way. Most importantly, it's far cheaper than the German and Japanese opposition. It's a car you'll want to keep in the family for years. Think of it as an old Volvo wagon, but far more stylish and cool. "
saab,9-5,2007,saab driver, 08/15/2007,Sleeper car,4,"This car is a Q ship. It has more power than a lot of other cars in the same price range, handles like a dream, and is very reliable. Who cares if it hasn't had a major restyling in nine years? They got it right then. Very solid, quiet, great stereo, and pretty good on gas too, not to mention crashworthier than a lot of coveted Japanese cars. "
saab,9-5,2007,Esconced, 09/24/2007,Love the Saab!,5,Haven't had the car long but it sure is impressive so far. I am so tired of the heavy feeling in many vehicles and I love the way this car combines power with a light feeling. This car doesn't need a long runway. It is difficult to find a vehicle that is fun to drive around town but also is a pleasure as a touring sedan. This car appears to be good at both. I will have a better idea when I take a 1600 mile road trip in a couple of weeks.
saab,9-5,2008,MD, 07/16/2009,Hopefully the SECRET will live on...,5,"I purchased my Saab after needing a sedan to mate with my Suburban that achieves a more corporate style, without going over the top. I have had my eye on the 9-5 for years.  This is the best SECRET car buy out there.  Like other reviewers, I was able to get mine at a great price and although it lacks some refinement, this is a great car.  Highway driving I get 30mpg and in the curves it is a fun car to drive.  My wife drives a Volvo XC70, which we love for its utility and space with two children and a dog, but the Saab has it beat!  The Suburban is a living room on wheels with 4WD; great for trips and the outdoors.  The Saab is just plain FUN and I get compliments all the time."
saab,9-5,2008,Dan Sim, 10/22/2010,An outstanding Swede,4,"I have had 17 Saabs of all variants since 1966. The Aero is the fastest safest and the most attractive of all. It has all the useful gadgets with out too much trendy clutter. audio is outstanding. The 235x17 tires, P6, are a bit noisy is a compromise for great performance. I am happy to get the final version of the 9000-95 evolution.I have had 2 of each. The orig. 86 9000T, a 91 9000T, a 01 95t Arc and now the 98 Aero. The 2.3 turbo remains a great motor, better than most 50% above its size. The Aero joins my 07 93, 74 Sonnett,73 96 v-4 and 68 96 v-4 in the driveway."
saab,9-5,2008,Adrian, 10/08/2008,"Fast, spacious, classy",4,"After driving several fleet Saab 9-5s in Norway, we bought one when moving to Canada. It's roomy, has great pace on the highway and (from the Norway experience) good dynamics on hard pack snow, despite not being 4WD.   Comes with lots of great gadgets (for the price) which fortunately do not lead to a profusion of switches and clutter.   Only gripe is the easily marked interior plastic surfaces."
saab,9-5,2008,Lindsey, 02/08/2016,Money Pit,3,"We purchased the car used at 85,000 miles (only 1 previous owner listed on the car facts, and all maintenance up to date.) We thought the car would be a good value for the price ($8999 before taxes.) The dealer told us up front that SAAB went under and that any new parts would have to be purchased out of the country, and he also told us of a couple of SAAB dealerships that were still operating in our area. Great! 
We test drove it, and fell in love with the luxury of the seats, the sun roof, the Boise surround sound system (super awesome sound system,) and the Turbo pick up and go. We loved it! 
After our purchase, things started falling apart. The headlights started going out, the circuit to the headlights started separating from the circuit board and had to be re-soldered on. By 98,000 miles, the car started idling rough. No sooner did that occur, then the car completely died while my husband was driving on the freeway!! He was able to eventually get the car to start again and drive off of the freeway, only to have it die again on the street. We called AAA, and by the time the tow truck arrived, the battery completely died out. 
We got it to a mechanic, who recommended a new transmission. Our dealer was able to locate a refurbished transmission with a 6 month warranty, and $1600 later, the car's check engine light pops back on. 
Oh, and the loaner car that our awesome dealer let us borrow during the transmission fix was a 2007 Saab 9-5  which also had check lights flashing on it's display. ""Check Headlights,"" ""Check oil,"" ""Check Tire Pressure."" 
Needless to say, we aren't very impressed with the durability of the SAAB engine, transmission or electronics.

GM should leverage this company for more of its designs in this fuel conscious age.  After incentives, etc., this car is nearly $17,000 less than a BMW or Audi!  Plus it has a GREAT warranty and nice options.  If you want a nameplate, look elsewhere, but anyone that wants a solid and practical car should look at SAAB.  I just wish GM would market them better!!"
saab,9-5,2008,Artic White , 02/16/2008,Underrated,4,"Had the car for 2 months now. Live in a snowy area, and there's just something about solid driving in snow while rear-wheel drive BMWs are sliding all around you. To me, there's something about a saab where it can be a driver's car and a passenger's car at the same time. I think that's a unique quality. A blast to drive, but doesn't make my passengers get headaches like in cars with really stiff suspensions. "

Something about no rear legroom. My new 9-5 is a gem and as rare as can be equipped with a smooth shifting five speed manual transmission. It's the perfect combination with the powerful 2.3L turbo. I love to drive this vehicle!  I test drove a BMW 5 series and was very unhappy with the feel of the manual transmission and the amount of room inside. For the price I paid, I could not have done better. I smile every time I open the door. If you are looking at a near luxury vehicle - do yourself a favor and test drive the Saab 9-5 sedan or wagon.

With all of the rebates that GM is currently offering on new 2008's and a little negotiation, I was able to snag mine for under $24k, which is a STEAL for a car like this.  After driving this car for a month, I couldn't be happier. The 260hp turbo engine makes highway driving a blast, and the car handles very nicely in town.  I can understand the harsh reviews given a $40k msrp and the quality of interior materials for a car in this price range, but for $24k I think you'd be hard-pressed to find fault."

Thanks for going bankrupt SAAB, now our car is near worthless and we're upside down on the loan! There are no replacement parts, there are no authorized service dealerships in the USA anymore, and there's nobody who is willing to buy this car off us at a reasonable price (because it's unreasonable to want a car that you won't be able to fix when something breaks). 

It drove fine, has quite a few features but it's become an antique in just 4 years. All the new cars out now have nice touchscreens and bluetooth and backup cameras."

I have been fortunate to own several high end Audi, BMW, and Mercedes automobiles. When shopping for a car this time I wanted something different from those (excellent) German vehicles.
The 2011 9-5 is beautifully made and a very tasteful exercise in restraint. Having recently traded in my A8L it is nice to have a break from chrome and wood. The 9-5 feels very secure on the road and the 2.8L provides more than adequate performance.
The pot holed B roads in New England do not break the cars composure even with the optional 19"" wheels."

This is not my daily driver, that is a 2010 Saab 9-3 sport-combi manual (yes manual) wagon. Both of these have been flawless.  I bought the 9-5 Aero new for $33,000 with an extended warranty that was never used. The only expense was a $65 sensor, which was readily available from GM.

I use this car primarily for road trips and do enjoy driving it. I like the aggressive stance, and enjoy the comfort of the car.

I figure if I sold it now for even 15k it would still have cost me less than many other cars in terms of depreciation.

Not for everyone, but I like that I don't have to turn a knob or click an icon to change a radio station. My wife's Audi is a pain to operate. The Saab is simple to operate, maybe primitive in today's world, but perfectly fine for me.

And, unlike the A6, 9-5 can be had with a 6 speed manual.
It's a big, rock-solid car with lots of sport: firm suspension, good steering.
It drives much smaller than it is.
On the highway the car is buttoned down and whisper quiet.
Saab offers a factory authorized power upgrade that brings torque to 300 ft/lbs.


Also, car has tons of tech in cabin and engine has the fancy upgrades: direct injection and twin scroll turbo, so 33 mpg HWY so far.

Still under 100k but virtually zero change in mechanics. Sunroof shade doesn't close reliably, the rubberized paint is coming off of the radio volume knob, and that's about it. Leather is in fantastic condition. 


Updated 11/25/2019:
Now approaching 90K miles, we've not had another repair. The car still looks modern and with a set of snow tires on we're ready for another season. We took an Infiniti QX80 to Chicago and back (about 700 miles) and welcomed the Saab's features and comfort upon return. I wish I could have more pride in the four cylinder's mileage but that aside, it does what we ask of it. 
Updated 5/25/2018:
Ironically, since the last post which was at 50000 miles (approximately two years ago), I haven't had any repairs done but a couple more things failed. That said, I still loathe driving this car even if it is to reposition it for replacing the summers with winters and again in the Spring. It's my wife's car and she loves it so there's your spectrum.

The memory seat is senile and I'm nearly certain this vehicle is trying to kill me. I enter and 50% of the time the key fab is recognized as mine and the seat adjusts, the mirrors adjust, but to a completely arbitrary position. The passenger mirror has an auto-down option for reverse to view the curbs, it continually tries to deflect downward past the limiter and clicks incessantly so I disabled it. The steering still feels like it has sand in it below 45F and now the sunshade fails to close or open or both. 

Merging onto a 35mph roadway from a ramp during construction with a temporary Yield and a friendly allowance by another motorist reminded me of how alarming an indecisive transmission can be. At 15mph waiting my turn and then being motioned ahead, I accelerated or at least, I moved my foot, nothing. I put my foot down further and total deceleration as the electronics took over and it deliberated over which gear would be appropriate. This is a Lexus 6spd transaxle and I believe the word the dealer used was ""bulletproof."" I don't want my tranny to be ballistically sound, I want it to shift gears. 

From earlier:
Having been a former Saab 9-5 Linear Wagon owner, I though this last ditch effort based on an Opel/Buick La Crosse platform would be relatively safe, particularly at a hefty discount due to the company's dissolved relationship with GM. Absolutely the most buyer's remorse I have experienced in 20 years and 15 vehicles including an Audi, and a Jeep. The seats are strangely difficult to configure to a contour that matches a human's spine, making even a short commute uncomfortable. Each day I'm reminded how even a respected extended warranty program faces challenges when working with a dealership who services Saab. The parts are ridiculously expensive and parts fail routinely. When all is working, a rare and short-lived period of time, the vehicle still gets 24mpg mixed and has terrible road manners in terms of wind noise, the inability to absorb bumps in the road, and performance. The six speed auto is indecisive where a second can lapse, mid-intersection, before it gets the hint you are in a hurry when your foot is buried in the floor board on the accelerator. I'm reminded of Jeremy Clarkson...""I'm a gearbox, I should be doing something...building a cake? Noooo, I know, SHIFT!"" Disappointing to say the least. 
After 50K miles, I look forward to offloading this vehicle as it has removed all of the joy of driving and ownership. I replaced my Audi with a Subaru and while I knowingly traded fun for function, at least I'm rewarded with relatively low maintenance and repair costs. With the Saab, it is just a chain of repairs with no end in sight and no benefit when the machine is fully functional. The NAV is joke and the infotainment lacks details you would expect from the cheapest of offerings. 

Stay as far away from it as possible. It
 hasn't been a Saab for some time but at least my Linear had more influence than picking through GM's used parts' bin.

saab,9-5,2011,Peter, 05/28/2018,Fantastic unicorn,5,"If considering this car, it may be one of the best cars Saab produced in its last 30 years. Few were produced and fewer still were exported to the US. It’s not for everyone, there are very limited parts, no dealers left, and certain features only a true Saab-phile will appreciate. Probably not a car for a first time Saab owner, but a GREAT one for a Saab devotee.

saab,9-5,2011,euro53, 01/24/2011,Change this seat,3,"I've been waiting 10 years for this car. I drove 3 premiums and 2 Aeros. I've been Saab owner of 4 cars since 1982. I love them especially for the best seat ever in any automobile.GM managed to stick this car with a Buick Lacrosse seat. There was no comfortable position to get the lumbar out of my back. I've spent 2 hours total in this car. The fan and instrument controls are tiny, and could be hard to see while driving.Rear view is not good.Trunk opening ala GM, huge lip in back, hard to put in bags. The 2 liter 4 cylinder is quick enough, and should save gas, while the Aero AWD seems heavy. If they fix the seat, I would buy one
Dealer said TOO BAD, as I stuck the check back in my pocket."
saab,9-7x,2005,CMD, 05/19/2010,Awesome Vehicle,4,"Bought after my TrailBlazer was totaled in an accident, it held up so well I knew I wanted another vehicle on this platform.  The 9-7X may look a lot like the TrailBlazer but it drives completely different.  The handling is absolutely fabulous for a truck based SUV.  The 4.2 L inline six is an excellent engine, I looked at the V8 but I feel that the six is just as good.  Fuel economy may be bad for a car but it is an SUV so I find my averages of 17.3 city and 22.8 highway (about 72-74 mph) to be acceptable."
saab,9-7x,2005,globaby, 04/13/2006,Don't buy one,2,"Had numerous problems. New heater core, rattling in dash and severe wind noise they can't/won't fix. People keep telling me it looks like a trailblazer. I won't be buying another GM product."
saab,9-7x,2005,Toyota Family, 12/15/2006,Pretty Good so Far,4,"The 9-7 has been great so far, the car is more comfortable than the living room and stereo/ air/ features are great. Friends compliment it a lot, and I never see them on the road, although they do look like a lot of cheaper GM cars. Only complaints are wind noise (not sure if it's side mirrors draft or sealing) and gas mileage (15 mpg avg over 15k miles). I don't commute so not such a big deal. Overall, I am very happy to be in the car."
saab,9-7x,2005,spencerhartman, 07/03/2005,9-7x,4,"The styling is a head turner when out on the town. The throaty V8 sound and associated 300 horse power realing make driving this SUV fun. I am also impressed with the tight turning radias and parking ease which my wife loves. Saab/GM has really made the total package SUV. Saab was smart to make a real five seat vehicle and not a so so third row seven seater which most SUV try to be but fall short. Lastly it is nice not to have to pay the extra $15,000.00 other SUVs makers make you pay for loading up the vehicle with options."
saab,9-7x,2005,Trish, 12/20/2006,FUN TO DRIVE,4,"I love my Saab SUV Arc .  It's safe, fun to drive and FAST! The V8 engine and horsepower are faster then most sport sedans which leaves the other drivers on the road with a surprised look on their faces. The only improvement I can see is the cup holders need to be improved.  They are weak and they wobble.  Also a navigation system would be nice!  I plan on purchasing another in 2008."
saab,9-7x,2005,James, 11/07/2006,The Princess Mobile,4,"My Princess is my wife. The Saab 97X is her chariot. We were looking for a road worthy and safe vehicle with some class. Also, made in America was a key issue. With a GM drive train and frame we knew it was a solid investment. The standard features would have cost $7-9,000 more on comparable vehicles. Its a dream to drive... when she lets me."
saab,9-7x,2005,L8R, 01/09/2009,Good SUV,4,"Bought it cert pre-owned w 36k miles on it. Drove it from Florida to Alaska through Yukon without one hitch. V8 is sharp, powerful, easily passes 18 wheelers on 2 lane roads. Steering is very nimble for an SUV, but a little numb (prob GM-based). Makes u-turns as well as my sport car (in 2 and half lanes). Interior provides nearly every feature a Mercedes SUV does. Good interior size and rear seats fold down for carrying bigger stuff. Performs better than most cars in the snow and ice (use studded snow tires!) due to its immense weight, but the engine doesn't make it feel heavy. 1 and 2 gear perform very well without over revving. Heated seats burn my back! (Good thing w -25 F temp)."
saab,9-7x,2005,Jerry Clemens, 01/22/2006,9-7X Poor Handling in Snow/Ice,2,"Now having driven this 9-7x in two mild snow falls here in Reno I can say that the awd is not suitable for winter driving. The awd will not engage until over 20 mph and when driving 0-20mph you have No awd active and this suv goes where it wants when cornering or trying to start up and incline from a dead start. The 9-7X bucks and fishtails and ends up in about a 60 degree angle before if any help comes from the front wheels pulling.  Stay with a true 4x4 with 4high, 4low on the fly option.  I am returning mine under the ""lemon law"". Having spun out 6 times in a 14 mile loop to work.  Not Safe At Any Speed in Winter. Also, No Tire Chains allowed per Saab,Usa/GM."
saab,9-7x,2005,DM, 08/31/2005,Saab 9-7X Linear,4,I am very pleased with the purchase of my Saab 9-7X Linear. It rides real smooth and has the safety I am looking for.  The seating is very comfortable and offers a lot of room.  I do find everything too compact.  There are not enough areas to store little things.  The gas mileage is not very efficient for todays gas problems.  I average 15.6 miles to the gallon.  That is including both Highway and City driving.  This is a luxury SUV in my opinion.  They offer onStar and satellite radio free for 3 months.  
saab,9-7x,2005,RP, 03/13/2006,People still turn their heads...,3,I am enjoying my 9-7x even though the prices at the pump make me question my decision sometimes.  People are constantly looking to see what I am driving and honestly I like that.  The styling is unique and the V8 is fun too.  I haven't had any problems to date and the SUV has been a pleasure to drive.  I only wish that the 2005 model had the fuel economy of the newer V8s with displacement on demand (or whatever GM calls it).
saab,9-7x,2005,Mike, 08/03/2005,"WOW, this is great",5,"This is the best car I have ever had. I have had BMW's, Range Rover's, Mercedes,and an Acura MDX. Nothing is as impressive as the Saab 9-7x. It handles like it's on rails and the 5.3 liter V-8 unleashes amazing amounts of thrust to my rear wheels. I pretty much live in my car because I have to drive all over New England for bussiness. Trust me you will love it!"
saab,9-7x,2005,Viggen23, 09/15/2005,Unique enough to be a SAAB,4,"This was a great first attempt by Saab to enter the SUV market. It is basically like a mini-Cadillac Escalade. Great unique styling sets it apart. On a 1000 mile road trip from OR to CA I didn't see another one on the road. Very plush and comfortable on the inside. As a true Saab afficionado, the ignition location in the center makes me feel like this is the real deal and not just a re-badge. Plenty of power, but acceleration up hills is a bit lackluster, I wish it had a turbo like my old 9-5. Fuel economy on the road trip was the as- advertised 21 mpg, luckily it runs on regular unleaded. All in all, great car with plenty of comfort and room to haul your stuff, plus the ability to tow. "
saab,9-7x,2005,Jeff, 09/22/2019,Quite possibly the worst car I've owned,2,"The 2005 had the transmission go at 40k miles. Transmission lines rusted through at 80k. Multiple other issues, Gm reliability is terrible.

The terrible suspension, the inability to seal sound of air from inside car,the front bumper which popped off due to cheap plastic pins (bumpers cost min $1,250). The pulling out of alingment and told it's normal. Blindspots, backing up you can't see a thing! Needs sensors. My Saab had water leak inside of it from rain. The dealer found out why in a release from one of many Saab does not give to owners. I waited for this car. What a waste!"
saab,9-7x,2005,yntny, 07/08/2006,Aircraft engineers.. give me a break,1,"I bought my Saab after waiting for a year. I thought it would be a great car. Was I wrong!. This car has been a bomb from the beginning. First my father was the project engineer on the F-14 from its inception So much for born from aircraft engineers.. he hates it. You should hear his comments. I bought it for its supposed sportiness, but I can get my 77 merc 280 sl convert to 80 without a glance and feel safe. This thing can barely hit 65 without me feeling like I'm pushing a tank... and all at an avg. 11.5 a gallon. Oh and 14.3 mpg on a long haul hwy drive."
saab,9-7x,2005,Maverick, 06/23/2005,Chevy in disguise,2,"Nice SUV and fully loaded with only the sunroof/rear dvd player option (must choose between the two for no additional charge).  Basically a Chevy Trailblazer in disguise here until the 9-6X arrives next year.  Lots of GM parts in the interior, makes you wonder about the long term reliablity.  The positive is that you usually won't see yourself coming and going while driving down the street."
saab,9-7x,2005,jjones, 05/14/2005,Excellent performance,5,The driving experience this car provides is awesome. I was surprised by the tremendous amount of power generated by the lineup of engines.
saab,9-7x,2005,inpdx, 06/29/2005,Not my father's SAAB,3,"Having owned 8 SAABs I bought the 9-7 because I needed the towing capacity of a larger vehicle. It's comfortable and can tow over 5000lbs but the drive train is truly dissapointing.  MPG only averages 15 in mixed driving (approx half city/half highway).  There is a noticable lag on acceleration from a stop, then it comes on all at once (are they trying to copy SAAB turbo lag??).  The transmission shifts nervously in city driving, constantly fishing and clunking between gears.  The engine and tranny combo remind me of a 60's Chevy pickup - completely unrefined.  Wish I had bought the XC-90 instead."
saab,9-7x,2005,Jeff, 07/08/2005,"9-7X definitely a ""sport"" utility.",4,"This car handles like you would expect a european car to handle, tight and responsive, doesn't feel like a truck at all. The inline six provides plenty of power and the four wheel disc brakes stop it effortlessly without a bit of fade. The interior is neat and clean without excess. The exterior styling is very clean also, the signature Saab front grille and headlight treatments distance it from its GM brethren. Overall great vehicle."
saab,9-7x,2005,JC, 07/26/2005,New Saab SUV,3,"I need a 4 wheel drive vehicle and wanted something towards the top of the line within my price range. With the employee discount deal, the Saab met those requirements. Also liked the all- inclusive deal...You only can choose between a sunroof or a DVD player. I took the sunroof. The ride is OK, but a bit you do feel the road quite a bit. Bottom Line: good deal for the price. "
saab,9-7x,2005,DC51, 07/26/2005,very nice.,4,"Recently purchased the Linear 97x. I've owned 5 SUV's since 1990 and this is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned. The Saab looks great and after 1 month of ownership I have yet to see another one on the road. Handles like a european sedan and comes fully loaded ! XM, On-Star, premium leather, DVD, side impact air bags, all standard. Rides great, looks great and comes loaded. Look forward to next 100,000 miles.  "
saab,9-7x,2005,Chris, 07/27/2005,Luxury for a Great Price,4,"With the GM discount, this Saab was delivered with every option for just over 34k.

Rides great, handles great for an SUV, rough on gas! The V6 has plenty of power, but go with the V8 if you are going to tow."
saab,9-7x,2005,Moldavian, 08/18/2005,It's a Steal!,4,"Without the GM discount, this SUV is still a great bargain; in fact, at $39K it beats most other luxury SUV's in price. With the GM discount this vehicle is an absolute steal at $33,800 (Linear V6). What a gorgeous interior! Saab did a wonderful job with this GMC/Chevy hybrid. It has a definite Saab feel inside and out.  This SUV comes with all of the bells and whistles that you can imagine - standard! "

saab,9-7x,2005,Mike, 06/19/2005,Great Value,5,"Driving between 35,000 & 45,000 per year, I am in & out of vehicles more often. I've been searching for several months, but nothing struck me. Even though it is on a GM platform, the 9-7X is nothing like one. Perfect vehicle for one  who is on the road for a living. Very confortable, user friendly, and suprisingly fuel efficient. The 9-7Xis priced right in comparision to its competitors....The 3 year (36,000 mi) free scheduled maintenance sweetens the deal. Highly reccomend this vehicle.. "
saab,9-7x,2005,will, 07/12/2005,Best Saab I've Owned,4,"This is my fouth Saab (I also own a 2001 9-3 convertible) and this is the best one yet. While it may have more than its share of GM truck infused in it, Saab has made a very creative take on it, and you really don't know you're driving a truck. It rides higher than a car, but it's much easier to get into than the Volvo, Mercedes, or Land Rover SUVs. It also rides better and has more cargo room than the BMW. And it's thousands less than all of those. Even if you're considering an American SUV, check the Saab out and you'll be pleasantly surprised with its quality, impressive handling and performance, and individuality. The interior is worlds better than the Chevy and on par with luxury SUVs."
saab,9-7x,2005,Sam Fruia, 07/20/2005,like riding in a cloud,4,"Fun, attractive, solid. I love this car, the car may not be the most fuel efficient but I do not mind the milage cost I just love driving and being in it, p.s. the xm radio does not hut the confort eather."
saab,9-7x,2005,Kev, 08/09/2005,Sweet Vehicle,4,"We are very happy with our new Saab 9-7X. It drives like a car and has an elegant look to it.  We think Saab has done a great job on the design.  When we are out enjoying our Saab, we always get second looks."
saab,9-7x,2005,Phillip, 10/18/2005,Impressed for Now,4,"Very pleased with the purchase so far.  You can really notice the change made to the handling by GM.  However, a close family memeber has a GMC Envoy and you really see a lot of the same characteristics in the Saab.  With GM's history I can only guess that how durable the 9-7 will be.  Although, you can't go wrong with the factory offered 4 year bumper to bumper warranty and 3 year service warranty.  These were very appealing at purchase.  In all, I would recommend the Saab, because I do not beleive you will find anything better for your money."
saab,9-7x,2006,Eugene, 09/15/2016,SAAB-Y!!!,5,"What a great vehicle! First let me say, do not worry about what KBB, NADA, Black Book, and Edmund’s say about price. These are fetching $2-5k over book value due to rarity and style. For my location it stated $5500-7500, of course since my state gets tons of snow for 6-8 months out of the year, 4x4 / AWD vehicles carry an extra premium beyond that, and these sites / books never take location and needs / demands into account
– The initial asking price was $12000, got it for $7500. As stated my state (Alaska) has a huge premium on 4x4 / AWD, especially as winter approaches.  
Currently on EBay these vehicles are listed around $6500 to $12000. Mine only had 84400 when purchased this summer, which is low for a 10 year old vehicle. 
-The other reason for purchasing - my last car was a 2014 Cruze with 23k miles. It was horrible!!! Worst clutch ever, and had no power, and took a $1500 hit because the front seat was killing my lower back, my wife and kids hated it, and was tired of being kicked on trips, plus my wife is unable to drive a manual due to spinal fusion.  Hate to step into an older vehicle with more miles, but it has been well worth it, and stepping up from a car with a mere 138hp and 128tq into something over double the power was also well worth it. My Cruze weighed over 3200 pounds with 138hp and poorly a placed torque curve
-The 9-7X’s power feels tremendous since 90% torque is available at 1700rpm and continues this path through majority of its power band. Having owned a few sub 7 and 6 second cars over the years, this one feels a bit quicker than the 7.6 quoted in Car&Driver. Reason for this? If you read their articles, most long term testers lose anywhere from 3-7/10th after 40-60k miles. Engine tolerance has been so tight this last 20 years, many vehicles actually feel stronger after a couple years of ownership. However, this is ‘butt’ of the seat feel from experience. My guess would 7.2 seconds to 60 with a good launch. Only did this once for test drive.  Either way, it has plenty of power for most people and will easily walk people from a light if you’re not careful. Most often I only need 1700-1900rpm to maintain a slight lead at stop lights. The 4.2i pulls nicely with a unique, but similar straight-6 sound. 
-Okay, parts are hard to find, and would purchase an extra set of vents and safely store them because eventually the originals will break while detailing. Same with the radio and climate control, these have paint wear, and there are few options to restore these. 
-Some articles say this vehicle is not worth it, but if they’re actually to drive a regular Trailblazer, Envoy, etc, it is a night and day difference. The 9-7X has airbags in the rear for starters, and the general suspension geometry was completely re-calibrated with components. Having driven my uncles Trailblazer with new struts, my 9-7X with original parts easily out shines it with handling. The SAAB feels like a different vehicle all together since the interior fit and finish is superior, plus the handling is just so much better.
-Basically, do not read those articles. Trust me, go drive a Trailblazer and then drive a 9-7X. The best part is Trailblazer are everywhere and this should not be a problem. Also, Trailblazer are typically priced similarly to a 9-7X and the SAAB has far more features.
-Gas mileage is great considering weight and power. I average 18 in mixed driving, but one trip was 23 mpg for over 200 miles. Besides, my wife has a 2016 Escape and she gets 28 combined with 33-34 on the highway – so this is not our long distance hauler. 
Basically this is a very personal feeling vehicle. Hopefully this review conveys that.

-----Updated mileage from 85500 to 89500-----my feelings have not changed since writing this review-----AWD system is not the best compared to my wife's Escape or my old Subaru. However it does well enough and since this
 vehicle is nice, I may install a transfer case from an Envoy with the Envoy's locking rear end. The AWD is one that engages when slip is detected. This can be abrupt and brutal at time depending on how much throttle is used, or if your rear is on a slippery surface, but your front tires are not.

It has been a good vehicle, but I recently have had several complications with it. When it turned about 65,000 miles, I noticed that there was a lot of wind noise on the highway. It sounded like the windows were not shut. I had the doors bent and seals replaced, and that fixed that. Then while gassing it up one day, I started it to find that the gas gauge read that it was empty and I had just filled it full. This was quite a spendy procedure to fix, as the gas tank had to be dropped from underneath. Also, the ride tends to be rough and bouncy. My biggest complaint is the poor MPG (I average 13 in town, 17 on highway). "
saab,9-7x,2006,T & C, 01/22/2006,What a ride!,4,"This vehicle is amazing to drive, smooth, good feel of the road, with a feeling of complete control thanks to the AWD feature.

saab,9-7x,2006,saabwonkka, 12/22/2008,So what if it's not built in Sweden,4,"I've been a Saab fanatic and have had numerous Saabs from classic 900s to a Saab 9-5 Aero wagon. I was skeptical to even consider a ""Saab"" built in Ohio.  So let's get a few things straight, yes it's based on a trailblazer/envoy and built in the USA, it's a great all around SUV for everyday use. It has just enough ground clearance to get through those plow piles at the end of your driveway. The all wheel drive system works great when you need it (no you 4wd people, it doesn't have locking diffs or low range 4wd) but how often do you really need that stuff. The 9-7x has been reliable and comfortable. It won't take you across the Sahara but it will take you anywhere you ""really"" must go!"
saab,9-7x,2006,mt_man, 02/09/2015,Wonderful SUV,4,This car has been great and I wouldn't trade it for anything. The car looks great inside and out (from the front). The ride it terrific and the handling is great for an SUV.
saab,9-7x,2006,Saab Fan, 10/31/2016,"Just Hit 32,000 - I will drive this forever.......",5,"The MPG  are horrible 15-19 max, with that said this suv with full time awd handles the road like nothing else I have driven.  It cuts through horrible Florida rainstorms like a knife through butter while everyone else is pulled off on the side of the road.  The I6 is not a speed demon, but it has great power on the upper end for freeway driving and will keep up with the 80 - 90 speedsteers on the highway and feels like your doing 50 or 60.  Seats fold down to haul stuff and the power options and heated seats make it a great ride for cross country trips which we have done a few times.  In Tennessee it went up the mountains like no body's business....  My vehicles in the past chugged up the mountain grades, this Saab climbs the summits with no problem.  The only thing I have owned that climbed mountains faster was my Cadillac DTS with a Northstar V8.  The resale has gone way up in the past few years, we are actually looking for another low mile 9-7x to buy because it is VERY reliable and cheap to fix.  People want $6-GRAND for this things going 130k-160k miles on them.  Buy the I6, not as fast but built to last....  The V8's are super quick, but are not making it to the higher mileage marks the I6's are hitting.  This SUV will go 300K if properly serviced and taken care of.  
11/07/2019 - 42,200 miles.  Waterpump Replaced this Spring, Ride Height Sensors Replaced, Idler Pulley Replaced.  Overall still very good.

Last week, the fan for heat stopped blowing @ $340 (I live in Iowa); to the most recent problem--the fuel connector quoted at $700+ (fuel shows on ""empty"").  And now, I have concerns with performance.  All this at 68,000 miles!  I change the oil every 3,000 miles, align wheels regularly and do the regular checks on all fluids.  Sound system gets hot when on for too long. I'm fearful of what's next"
saab,9-7x,2006,Paul, 12/11/2008,Run,2,"Best thing about my Saab is the extra 100,000 mile warrenty I purchased. Car has 48,000 miles on it. Without that extra warrenty I would easily be out about 5k by now. New accelerator, two new starters, two new windshield wiper pumps, new computer....there might be more...the past year is a bit of a blur to me at this point. Anyone want to buy a car?"
saab,9-7x,2006,Steve, 04/16/2009,Get one if you can,4,"Our 97-x replaced a leased Honda Pilot.  We weren't sure at that time whether we had made a good decision... but after a few weeks it was apparent that we got a lot of SUV for the money.  Three kids (two in booster seats) fit easily into the rear seat, and there is at least as much storage room behind the seat as the Pilot (maybe even more). The front seats are very comfortable and we really like the dual climate control, since my wife is always cold and I'm always warm!  The 18 inch tires provide a very smooth ride. We bought is used at a great saving from the original price and so far it has been worth every cent.  I would recommend this SUV."
saab,9-7x,2006,3saabmike, 04/26/2009,I see another one about once a month...,4,"I love this SUV. I needed an SUV for work as I demonstrate medical equipment and have to carry around equipment that weighs 300 pounds and is about the size of a small dresser, so I looked at the SAAB and was impressed. I had driven a Trailblazer for 100k miles before this and there is no comparison. I like the sophisticated looks and the fact that when it breaks I can take advantage of lower priced GM parts bin stuff. This is the main reason I didn't buy the Cayenne. I am at 40,000 miles right now and nothing has gone wrong. The only thing that wore prematurely were the brake rotors at 22,000 miles, which wasn't bad as it only cost a few hundred bucks to fix."
saab,9-7x,2006,AK Driver, 05/22/2009,Good Vehicle for Price,4,"I purchased this vehicle for my wife to transport the kids around.  It is very comfortable and roomy for a smaller SUV.  The engine does very well for an I6, but fuel mileage could be better (I guess you can have one or the other more power less mileage or more mileage less power).  Bought it used and a good investment so far.  Had a slight alignment issue, once fixed have had no problems.  One frustrating thing is it is very hard to get accessories for this vehicle.  Overall good vehicle for the price."
saab,9-7x,2006,Dave, 09/12/2009,Great buy,4,I love my 06 9-7x 5.3 I have owned many SUVs and this is the best one.  300 hp and I can get 24 mpg on a trip.  The interior feels strong and solid unlike my old Nissan.
saab,9-7x,2006,kevin squibb, 01/22/2006,2006 97x,5,"You get a lot for your money with this vehicle. The vehicle is extremely quite, has good acceleration and handles and rides a lot like car.   "
saab,9-7x,2006,dawgpound55, 11/15/2006,"Saab 9-7X, much better than you think...",4,"I was anxious about trading in my 2000 9-5 Aero for the 9-7X because of my perception of it's lack of refinement. It truly has been a better vehicle than I expected, and I'm glad to have stuck to the Saab brand for this purchase. It has decent acceleration, handling and breaking and appears to have good fit and finish. I wish that it had a six speed auto (or even a 5 speed) but the transmission is smooth and seems to keep the engine well within it's broad powerband. Although it has a solid rear axel, it doesn't hop over rough pavement as I expected. Styling is personal, but I believe that Saab did a nice job putting their touches on this vehicle. I have gotten many compliments on its looks."
saab,9-7x,2006,BCR, 01/12/2007,Great value but expect some issues,4,"If you can get this vehicle for under $35k you would have a tough time beating the value in the higher-end SUV market.  It looks great (inside and out), is roomy, and the ride is OUTSTANDING.  Saab-GM have done a great job improving the suspension, lowering the floor one inch (makes for easy in and out), and soundproofing the vehicle. If you have small ones, you'll love the latch points for car seats - they are extremely easy to get to.  4.2 has plenty of power. We live at high altitude and it takes climbs well.  Disappointments - low beams and lumbar support did not work on delivery.  Battery went dead after having the radio on for 10 minutes (battery power only).  More storage please!"
saab,9-7x,2006,Tom A, 01/28/2007,Solid SUV regardless of origins,4,"Yes, it's a pretty mundane GM truck underneath the Saab-designed exterior. But it's got a great engine that gives fairly good fuel economy for the class, and the ability to tow more than its competitors. Plus it's more refined and better to drive than an Explorer, Grand Cherokee, 4Runner, and the like. And it's got great value. But more importantly, it's not like I'll lose it in a parking lot."
saab,9-7x,2006,NUBULLY, 01/08/2008,My car is in the shop while I'm typing!,2,"Run away from this SUV. When we leased this SUV, GM had a promo: give us 27 months. Well, this morning when I tried to start the engine it turned over but did not start (for the 5th time). I have 4 more months until the 27 months are up. I gave them 27 months and I know to stay away!!!!  THIS is why you lease autos, if I purchased this SUV I would be out my mind right now. The car drives nice but it gets horrid gas mileage and its been in the shop a lot. The interior fit and finish are still good. The XM/Radio antenna wasn't installed properly as well as the R/S mirror was 1/2 installed when we took delivery.  NYBULLY"
saab,9-7x,2006,T, 09/26/2008,Good for $? Yes it could be.,4,"Just got a 2-year old certified one.  Can't  beat the value for what they go for nowadays.  (with the heavy incentives, the 08 new models would be an attractive option too.)  Understand that one of the biggest complaints on this vehicle is the fuel efficiency, but when you do the side-by-side comparisons AND THEN calculate it into additional costs for the duration of your planned ownership, well it made the financial sense for us and we were happy to get into this semi-luxury SUV in a heavy snow prone area that we live in."
saab,9-7x,2006,DDW, 11/26/2008,Can't Go Wrong,4,"Very happy with this luxury SUV.  Bought it used. Added Techron fuel system cleaner and got 2 MPG better than before.  To connect my iPod, I had an iSimple installed to the existing Bose system.  Works and sounds great!  Stock tires don't work well in snow, so I put on Hancook Icebears and now can go thru anything and do not give up much on dry roads.  Fuel economy suffers from the 3.73 differentials versus the 3.45 on GM cousins, but low gears do improve the get up and go.  With 277 lb-ft of torque, they could have made the down shift from 4th to 3rd later. This thing spends more time in 3rd gear than our Pontiac Vibe."
saab,9-7x,2006,richard, 06/29/2009,Converted to SAAB,4,"I purchased my 9-7 for $14,000 with 35,000 miles. I recently hit 52,000 and the only thing I have replaced are the original tires and standard oil changes.  Sweet ride with adequate power and great looks. I have three kids who play sports and the 9-7x has been a great animal and kid hauler. I average 18-19 mpg in Atlanta city and hwy traffic.  Best value on the road!"
saab,9-7x,2006,Terribly disappointe, 07/22/2009,Terribly disappointed,3,"I have been a Saab fan for years and have really never heard anything bad said about them. I bought mine used in June, 2009. It only had 38,000 miles on it. I had it in the service repair shop 4 times in the first month of ownership. Twice for suspension problems and twice for door seals. The suspension seems to be ok now but the seals obviously are not. It still sounds like the windows are down when riding above 45mph. The MPG is HORRIBLE! It gets 12, sometimes 13 MPG around town (not heavy traffic either). It has only gotten 16 on the highway. I will not fault Saab. I fault GM for trying to tweak a normal American SUV into a Saab. Maybe I just got a bad one."
saab,9-7x,2006,MangoOTK, 02/08/2006,Happy Driver of this 6000 lb'er,4,"The primary motivation for this end of year purchase was that it met certain tax write-off requirements of 6000lbs. We were considering the RX330 from Lexus pretty seriously, but it wasn't heavy enough.  We're more than satisfied with the power and ruggedness of the drivetrain. We haven't had it in the mud yet, but hope to see some late-season (calif) skiing.  The vehicle turns a lot of heads and generates much interest in a sea of BMW X5's, Lexus and Navigators from people who are amazed that it is a Saab.  The cons: Gas mileage is below average at about 14MPG. But hey, we can tow a boat or trailor. Fit and finish were a little rough on the interior, but I'm a detail guy. "
saab,9-7x,2006,sprint, 03/01/2006,Maybe a little too much GM influenece,4,"Having owned a number of Saabs, you appreciate the quality that goes into the design characteristics of their autos. Overall the 9-7 a nice SUV, but having driven the vehicle for a few weeks, you notice the subtle GM influences through out both the interior & exterior. Kind of cheapens the SAAB name in my opinion. Many components have GM written all over it, but SAAB was able to enhance the vehicle just enough to make it enjoyable to drive."
saab,9-7x,2006,TIM in Miami, 03/12/2006,TRULY WONDERFUL VALUE,4,"Saab really made a great SUV.  I feel it compares favorably to the XC 90, the X5, and the Touareg (all fine SUVs).  The 9-7X offers the same features, with 18 inch wheels and more horsepower for at least $5K less than the others similarly equipped. "
saab,9-7x,2006,Fred, 04/10/2006,Sweet Ride,4,"Beautiful SUV inside and out.  Saab did an outstanding job of ""Saabifiying"" this vehicle.  I had a Trailblazer as a rental for a week before I bought my 97x and the difference between the way the two drive is quite remarkable.  It really does have more responsive handling and a very european feel."
saab,9-7x,2006,demetri, 04/25/2006,It won't let you down!,4,"Ok, so it's a GM deep down ... once you get over that you'll see how fun it is to drive.  The suspension is tight (I used to drive a G35 - hard - and I honestly don't miss it).  The AWD is a treat.  It has every bell and whistle you can ask for.  I used to own an '01 Aurora and I must say this is not far from it.  The fuel (in)efficiency is a total drag but it wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the ridiculously high cost of gas.  Acceleration is great but with a 4-speed transmission you can't wait till the last minute (the computer does predictive shifting for the overdrive).  Only a couple of fit/finish issues."
saab,9-7x,2006,dtrotter, 06/19/2006,The 9-7X Saab Story,4,"While looking for a replacement lease vehicle I was interested in the value proposition of getting an SUV with the most luxury and perfomance possible for the price.  The Saab 9-7X absolutely delivered.  Admittedly, it's not the best luxury SUV available, but with a full option list and V8 performance it beat comparably equipped competitors by $10,000.  And while the Saab faithful might not embrace it, it made someone who never would have considered a Saab a convert.   The 9-7X provides a solid integration of performance, luxury, ride, braking, handling, and ergonomics, and does so while looking great as well."
saab,9-7x,2006,Jack&Karen, 07/22/2006,Excellent All Around SUV,4,"Leased a 9-7X for my wife and she absolutely adores it.  We don't have kids so it's just the right size.  Everything is extremely smooth operating, fit and finish are great and the structure is very rigid.  It's hard to believe it's based on the Envoy chassis... it really handles great (the Envoy is a great truck but it handles like a truck when you hit the corners).  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone that would enjoy a mechanically sophisticated luxury SUV."
saab,9-7x,2006,kevinps, 07/25/2006,Saab 9-7X (8 Cyl.),5,"The car rides smoothly and quietly, and the gas consumption isn't that much more than the 9-3."
saab,9-7x,2006,casey, 07/24/2006,The Non-Swedish Saab,4,"Being one of the first driving this Saab in the Netherlands it is a pleasure driving it. Saab tried to keep the sales price low compared to its european competitors. Giving some success so far. As hardly anybody knows the car, you get a lot of attentions from others. It is a pity that  the gearbox has only 4 and not 5 gears. Let's see if this Saab will meet the elk-test in Schweden. A small pity is that the specific US-features do not work in Europe."
saab,9-7x,2006,nj driver, 08/21/2006,new owner,4,I was not happy with the whistle coming from my tires  but came to find out it is a defect which will be fixed this week. A left axle problem  I miss space for items around the front seat but love the easy access to everything.  Back seat passengers complain about stiff back seat backs.  Drove my daughter out to college with 4 x 8 uhaul trailer and it averaged 16 miles per gallon and handled well.  I enjoy my suv but would like better mpg.  Enjoy yours!
saab,9-7x,2006,Tierney, 01/27/2006,Worth a look -,4,"A really superb re-work of the GMC Envoy with much more up-market look and feel. Saab's efforts to stylize the vehicle differently from it's cousins was beautifully executed. In the end, having owned a BMW X5, an ML-320 and various mid to high end cars, I'm entirely pleased with the 97x. "
saab,9-7x,2006,william mitchell, 02/12/2006,2006 SAAB SUV REVIEW,4,The car handles great. At 70 miles an hour you're doing over 2500rpm. I like the stiff ride but not shocking. 
saab,9-7x,2006,JC, 02/22/2006,9-7x is a great luxury SUV,4,"I was looking for something to replace my troublesome Volvo XC90, which I liked, but had just way too many issues with. Since I own a 9-3 Sport Sedan, I took the Saab for a drive. I bought it the same day. After driving the X5 and Cayenne, the 9-7x is good competition for both, but provides a slightly more liveable ride while giving good handling response, better than in most SUVs. Cargo room is also better in the Saab, and while it doesn't have a third row, it gives second row passengers more room than those trying to cram in three rows of seats. The interior is also nicely finished, better than any recent GM product I've been in. It's a great buy and I highly recommend it."
saab,9-7x,2006,Hank, 04/14/2006,Saab,4,"An excellent effort on GM's part to build an upscale alternative to the Envoy. My previous vehicle was an Envoy and the Saab is a better SUV in every way. The 9-7X handles more like a sedan the ride is firm but smooth. The 4.3L engine provides good acceleration but fuel economy suffers. The interior is quiet and well appointed with noticable Saab enchancements. The seats are very comfortable and suitable for long trips. The exterior has strong Saab styling influences which give give it an upscale look. The 9-7X competes admirably against its BMW X5, Volvo XC90 and Acura MDX counterparts. Overall the 97-X is great value for the money and I would highly recommend this vehicle."
saab,9-7x,2006,JW, 07/30/2006,Quiet ride/Great SUV,4,I think it is worth paying extra for the Saab version of the GM SUVs.  The ride is as quiet as a lux car.  No rattles or unwanted sounds.  Handling is very good for an SUV.  Forget the V8 unless you are heavy towing.  The V6 is more than ample for day to day driving.  
saab,9-7x,2006,Smitty, 08/28/2006,2nd look at Saab 9-7x,4,"I am happy with my purchase of the 9-7X. I love the ride, handling, power (V8) and the interior and exterior appearance . For the money the 9-7X is the best buy. You get loads of standard equipment that you will really use in your day to day driving and not standard equipment that you will never use like off road package. There were only two options (Nav and DVD entertainment) for the 5.3i which i got and just love. Also, the optional 18 inch Brightly Polished split 6 spoke rims are beautiful. these rims make the vehicle look even sexier. Saab did an excellent job on these rims. Good job to the Saab engineers for really making an enjoyable SUV!"
saab,9-7x,2006,kayvan, 09/07/2006,Good Car for the Price,3,"It has good acceleration, handles well on corners, fuel economy could be better, it's hard not to push the gas pedal. It comes loaded with a lot of features, overall a satisfied customer. Looking forward to driving it in the snow."
saab,9-7x,2006,Mary Ann, 09/09/2006,Great Luxurious SUV,4,The car has a smooth ride.  I have not seen anyone down here in the Rio Grande Valley with one.  So it's fun to see people stare at it when I drive.  The car is perfect for my son and I.  I've really enjoyed it.
saab,9-7x,2006,ghack, 03/24/2008,Entertaining Platformed Vehicle,5,"Considerable sportier handling than its other shared platform vehicles.  Any issues that have occurred, dealership has the utmost professionalism in correcting the problem with few questions asked"
saab,9-7x,2006,huggio, 08/26/2020,Love my (GM) Saab!,4,"Overall, this is a good, reliable, study vehicle. I bought it used and had all the recommended repairs done, but since (8 years and counting) have only done routine maintenance - and several recalls. 

It has a minor electrical issue (static sometimes when I play the radio), but I realized when shopping for a replacement that my main annoyance with it are the cup holders. One is flimsy and worthless, and the other is poorly located so larger cups get trapped by the gear shift. After 122,000 miles, that's the worst I have. ;-)"
saab,9-7x,2007,gmt360, 09/06/2014,Least ownership costs ever,4,"I've had this car for 85,000 miles and drive it every day.  I have not had a single issue or problem of any kind in all of these years.  To date the exhaustive list of repairs includes rear brake pads and rotors and new tires.  That's it.  Not a single penny out of pocket.  I am astounded as I've never in all of my years experienced anything like this.  I live in the harshest climate and still no issues. I have every single option offered except the 6.0liter v8. At the same time I purchased the 9-7, I purchased the identical Rainier.  The Rainier has had a dozen expensive issues while the 9-7 is some sort of anomaly at this point.  "
saab,9-7x,2007,SDalton, 01/03/2007,Great Car,4,"We just bought the 9-7X last week and absolutely love it. We test drove the Lexus 350, Volvo X90 and while they were great cars themselves, it was hard to pass up all the standard features the Saab had that we'd end up having to add on with the others. Great car!"
saab,9-7x,2007,Carl Sanders, 08/24/2010,Minor issues but love it!,4,"When I first bought the truck I had to replace all of the brakes and rotors as they had rusted out from being driven in the north with all of the salt they put out for the snow. I also had to replace the factory tires at 30,000 miles but other than those minor maintenance issues it has been a great vehicle. People are always impressed by the way it looks and say they never knew Saab made an SUV. I like that it is a unique model and I never see anyone else driving my truck. I would probably not recommend it to anyone though because of the horrible gas mileage as they can probably find something that looks just as good but with better gas mileage. "
saab,9-7x,2007,Bob, 09/06/2008,great car,4,I just love driving this car. I get great comments about the beauty of the car from strangers. It handles great with great passing ability and smooth acceleration entering the highway. My two golden retrievers sleep or rest comfortably on long drives. I just can't say enough about what a lovely car this 97x is to own and drive!
saab,9-7x,2007,RJETER, 10/28/2006,I love this SUV,4,"You have to drive this SUV to appreciate its ability. It's big, but hugs the road. A powerful engine that can run with just about any SUV out there.  Fun to drive and if you close your eyes you might think your in a car. The 18 inch tires give it the strong masculine look. It's loaded with more standards then most vehicles.  "
saab,9-7x,2007,jerry thomas, 11/08/2006,Great SUV - heavy and secure,4,"The car not only looks hot, but is hot. Great ride, handles great and turns on a dime. I love it!"
saab,9-7x,2007,EstateAttorney, 01/30/2009,Great SUV for the price,4,"We currently have 20,000 trouble free miles on our Saab 9-7X.  I bought this SUV because it looks & feels as good as the Porsche SUV but for far less money.  The handling is excellent for an SUV, the acceleration is more than adequate considering we did not opt for the V8.  It feels like you are driving a more expensive car.  "
saab,9-7x,2007,SS, 10/24/2010,Liked it enough to get another 4 wife,4,"Many have already said that the 9-7x is a great value.  I agree, an undervalued SUV that delivers a great driving experience.  And for you who think it is just a re-badged Trailblazer, you have to drive one to experience the difference.  Tighter suspension, smoother ride, much quieter.  Yes, I bought a 2008 a year after getting mine.  "

saab,9-7x,2007,NNovesky, 05/22/2007,Too many Saab snobs,4,"For once we have a vehicle that is what it is supposed to be: an unpretentious upscale SUV.  As an owner of four Saabs over the years, each met my expectation of what I thought it was supposed to be. This is one of Saab's strengths. I have loved each for what they were: sporty in some cases, practical in others.  The 9-7x is a little of both. I truly enjoy the 9-7x for the space it provides, the smooth pleasant ride, great comfort,  and a sense of size without being overwhelming to the driver. I test drove most other SUV types in this class (from a well equipped Honda Pilot to the Volvo, Acura, Mercedes, Mazda models) and found sometimes small, sometimes large disappointments with each. Try it."
saab,9-7x,2007,Ray, 02/01/2010,GREAT so far!,4,"I bought this car almost a year ago used at a great deal. I love it! It has all the luxury one could want, heated seats, navi, dvd, sunroof etc... It handles nicely and so far (with 41,000 miles) I have had no issues at all. "
saab,9-7x,2007,jrubel, 02/24/2007,Love It,5,"This car is better than I imagined. Great performance, styling, and comfort.  I get a ton of compliments on the car and I am surprised not to see more on the road."

saab,9-7x,2007,chris even, 08/28/2016,A GM with a touch of Saab,4,"It's good, not great. Lacking in some of the finer points that most near luxury SUVs have. Power lift gate would have been nice. Even a stereo that looks like it didn't come out of a Mack truck would be good. And no aux jack, how?
"
saab,9-7x,2007,Scott, 01/30/2009,What a dream!,4,"My Saab SUV is incredibly comfortable, sporty, and fun to drive, and I find myself looking forward to using it everyday.  The GM SUV platform may actually give this car greater reliability over its Swedish born sedan cousins, but I suppose time will tell.  Furthermore, I really enjoy having an unusual SUV, one that you don't see everyday.  My summary impression of this Saab is that it is underrated and represents a terrific bargain in the used car market.  "
saab,9-7x,2007,lycklig, 06/29/2011,"""Garage Queen""",2,"I have owned, and loved, 3 previous SAABs, but this one is a major disappointment. I purchased this so that the tall men in my life would no longer have to leave their knees at home when we go on a trip. The space is great and comfy, DVD and multi-CD players are sweet, and the on-board air-compressor is a great asset. BUT, it is sluggish when going uphill (diesel-pushers cruise past us), has had multiple major issues, and spends more time in the dealership garage than on the road with me. Gas mileage is about the same as my Suburban. This 9-7X has cost me so much time and money. I can hardly wait to trade it in!"

saab,9-7x,2007,susan, 10/02/2007,9-7x,5,"I am over 6 ft and this car fits my style perfectly, head room, leg room great.  I had considered the Mercedes SUV but glad I changed my mind and thought about the Saab ingenuity.  Love the way it drives and handles.  It is a statement SUV despite the connection with GM."
saab,9-7x,2007,Jen, 08/21/2016,"After a while, pure disappointment",2,"We purchased this vehicle used in 2011 with about 35000 miles on it.  In the years we've owned it, the transmission went out (in less than two years), the fuel sensor broke (which we fixed under the recall), the oil pressure sensor broke (we fixed on our own), the led brake light in the back went out and we had to replace it for $150, the cup holder that pops out near the radio broke...plus it was the worst cup holder that was every designed because you can only hold a small can of soda or a small fountain drink in there, other wise the drink constantly spills over on the floor, the check tire pressure comes on every now and then when the tires are perfectly fine, the service tire monitor comes on a few times a month and that's annoying, especially when there's nothing wrong with it, and sometimes the traction control will take affect in the middle of summer.  Also with the power seats, sometimes the seat fails to move back or forward....we finally figured out that if you hit the front of the seat hard, it will start working again.  Then back to the cup holders, there are two in the front and two in the back.  I already talked about the one, but the other in the front is in a horrible spot.  You can only put a small soda can there and that's it.  As soon as you put the vehicle in park, the gear shifter covers the spot of the cup holder.  So a larger drink, you have to take out of the cup holder in order to put the car into park.  The cup holders in the back were also poorly designed (they are near the floor in the middle).  Any type of vibration or turn makes the drinks fall over from the holders and spill all over the floor.   Don't even get me started on fuel economy.  They also designed it that the jack is located underneath the middle seats....which if you have a car seat back there, you have to take the car seat out first then fold it up to get to it.  should have built it in the back cargo area.  The only pros about this vehicle was the power of the engine, memory seats, great cargo area, built in air compressor, and the towing.  We still have this vehicle even though we are switching over to a van, but we do feel like the transmission is about to go out again.

saab,9-7x,2007,cmadams219, 05/30/2014,"Greaf car, but poor gas mileage",4,"This car drives and handles well.
When I bought it, it was my 4th SUV.
It has been the best.
I hate to part with it, just time for newer vehicle. SAAB let us down when they went out of business."
saab,9-7x,2007,Chicago 9-7, 01/30/2007,New Saab owner,3,"I looked the the GMC Envoy Denalli and SLT with the 4.2.  In the Envoy there was a huge difference between the Denalli and the SLT with the 4.2.  The 9-7x falls right in between as far a comfort and ride.  You get much more luxury with the 9-7 than with the Envoy SLT.  The 9-7's ride and handling with the lower profile and larger wheels makes a dramatic difference.  Unless you actually want to drive somewhere off road, I would choose the 9-7 vs its GM brothers.  The downside is the quality and fit and finish are still GM.  You're not buying a lexus.  "
saab,9-7x,2008,R.K. Bush, 09/29/2010,Best In Class,4,"Although built on the same platform as the Chevy Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Olds Bravada, Buick Rainier and Isuzu Ascender, this vehicle tops them all. The superior suspension alone (unique to the Saab) sets it apart in terms of ride. It is quieter, handles better and is nicer inside than the others (I've test-driven both the Envoy Denali and the Rainier). It looks better, too. Saab got it right!"
saab,9-7x,2008,JT from NC, 02/06/2008,Mercedes to Saab,4,Drove 9-7X from FL to NC and it handled beautifully. Not quite the E320 Mercedes ride but more than adequate. Great interior comfort and distinctive exterior.  The Bose sound and the add ons to basic vehicle make for a nice package. Pricey and wish mileage was better 15-18/gal. Certainly didn't see many on the road so a unique. So far so good.
saab,9-7x,2008,Jen Phi Sig, 03/18/2009,A soon to be classic SUV,4,"Purchased this car to replace a Volvo XC 90.  This SUV is a real head turner, even when sitting still.  Have only seen one other like ours in the area. A ride like a plush SUV but hang when the right pedal is mashed, this really moves with the 6.0 liter V-8. Yes the MPG is low but hey its an all wheel drive full frame SUV, not like the cookie cutter uni body SUVS that are everywhere today. Bought it for $26,000 with 12,000 miles on it. Loaded with every option. Would do it over again in a heartbeat. No complaints as of yet. "
saab,9-7x,2008,M. Fanelli, 03/15/2008,From Car to SUV,4,This is my first SUV. I was driving an 05 Saab 9-3 and we wanted more space when we travel so we went to the 9-7x. So its not a purebred Saab but it sure turns heads. Very comfortable compared to its GM cousins. Don't always believe the expert reviews. You need to drive a car to appreciate it. 
saab,9-7x,2008,D & D, 06/22/2010,The un-SAAB SUV,4,"we had test drove an 08 4.2 before leasing a cx-7 as wife wanted a saab but 9-4x wasn't out (and still isn't) Now we need to replace the lease (still no 9-4x). As disappointing as the 4.2 was the Aero is incredible. great suspension & acceleration.  The glove soft leather &french stitched door trim combined w/ the 9-5 cup holder & corvette engine & buick ranier laminated glass, olds bravada d- pillar & envoy interior door trim w/blazer bits & pieces make this the best of the ladder-on-frame suv rebadges. Like a tuxedo clad rugged SUV. Coming off lease the SAAB is less than a trailblazer SS w items you can't get on the Chevy. GREAT VALUE, reminds wife of the GMC Typhoon/cyclone when we were kids"
saab,9-7x,2008,Happy customer, 04/15/2008,Good Package for money,4,"SUV is appointed very nicely, good value for the money. Don't listen to experts GM makes nice cars, the Saab is in line with GM's Cadillac vehicles. As far as mpg the crossovers don't do much better but the Saab has lots of room. We pay $1.50 for bottled water but complain about 14mpg. Buy a Prius if that is your concern. Overall great vehicle."
saab,9-7x,2008,B. Page, 04/18/2008,Acura TL to Saab 97-X,4,Having a baby requires more room than your typical sedan; hence my need to upgrade to an SUV. With the current gas prices what they are I was concerned with the size engine I would get (a V-6 versus a V-8) and how it would accelerate; this one proved to be a winner.  It is quite zippy and hugs the road where I need it to.  It had all of the bells and whistles that I was accustomed to and more.  As a short woman I can easily get in and out and getting the baby in and out is also a breeze. There is plenty of cargo space for us even after a heavy day of shopping!  So far the only downside that I can find is that there could be a few  cubby's for things like cell phones and other misc. items.
saab,9-7x,2008,SvenBanginshea, 09/02/2008,A Sexy Beast!,4,"What a sexy beast! The 9-7x Aero is a rare classic that was doomed by the poor timing of >$3.50/g gas. Their loss in sales is my gain in rarity. I have owned many exclusive, classic and modern sports cars, but never have I received so many admiring second- looks and seen so much drool from jaw dropping performance envy. Blows away all other SUVs except for fools that paid well over 2x as much for the turbo pepper S. And did I mention that the exterior is second to none!  I have never stated this but, ""Good Work, GM""!  "
saab,9-7x,2008,bIll, 06/03/2010,SAAB 9-7x Aero (SS-Package),4,"This is a Trailblazer SS in SAAB Suit!  The Performance and ability to hide in a crowd is Great!  Push down on the GO PEDAL and life changes in 5.5 sec's flat. Gas Mileage is 13-15 at best, but this isn't for the faint of heart.  The Seats don't hold you in the corners like an SS and that would have been an EASY fix (JCI-GM)  The Cup holder in the dash was totally a waste of time and money, but SAAB Wanted that. (I wonder why)  The Auto AC is a TOTAL JOKE! No feed back loop to confirm real air temp in cabin.  (Duh, I guess they didn't have enough engineer's that day at GM-HVAC)"
saab,9-7x,2008,J. Johnson, 03/03/2008,Love My Saab 9-7x,4,"Home run, it's a great SUV! The interior is very quiet and the Bose system is excellent.  The ride is smooth and the vehicle hugs the road/curves with stability and comfort.  I love the styling - understated but elegant!  The seats are very comfortable and I really enjoy driving this vehicle.  "
saab,9-7x,2008,Joseph, 07/19/2010,If You are Looking for A Different SUV,3,You will not see many SAAB 9-7X on the road. That can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your point of view. With two weeks I have had my vehicle in the shop twice. Hmm. I have a wait and see attitude. What will be the next thing that have me back at the shop.
saab,9-7x,2008,vern in indy, 05/07/2008,It's a car,2,My overall impression is that Saab did their best to turn a small/mid sized SUV into a car.  Im counting the days until my 27 month lease expires.  
saab,9-7x,2008,Sleeper SUV, 08/29/2008,Sleeper SUV,4,"This is a beast in a tux, punch the right pedal and hold on.  We needed a larger vehicle and the wanted something that looked good but, we demand performance.  This vehicle corners, accelerates and stops better than most sedans, a great addition to our 9-2X.  If you want good fuel economy this is not the SUV for you.  Cannot wait until we get another Michigan winter and can see how well it does in the snow."
saab,9-7x,2008,Happy Customer, 03/28/2008,Perfect Combination of Lux and Fun,4,"This is our second Saab and it has proven to be as much fun as the 9-3 it's parked next to.  An excellent combination of luxury (OnStar, XM radio, leather, high-intensity headlamps, Bose sound, sun roof, heated seats, rear climate control, dual-zone climate control - all standard), fun, capability (V8, easy cruising in the mountains, up to 6500 lbs towing), and support (free 1 yr. OnStar, free 36 mo. scheduled maintenance, 100,000 mile power train warranty).  Don't listen to the 'expert' reviewers - some of them have not even driven it. You have to drive it to appreciate that it is performance tuned by Saab and outfitted with more luxury than it's GM cousins. "
saab,9-7x,2008,greg c, 05/22/2016,Midlife Crisis Averted,5,"What a great SUV for dad. Incredible power from the low end and a smooth ride on the highway.  I spend a lot of time in the mountains around Asheville working and this Saab has made the drive so fun.  This reminds me of driving a hot rod as a kid.  Great acceleration, incredible handling and a thrill to drive.  The Aero is the cream of the crop, lots of fun and lots of power.
"
saab,9-7x,2008,Nick Resetar, 05/16/2008,Great SUV,4,"Awesome SUV. If you need a real SUV like I do for towing, you can't beat the 9-7x. The standard features blow away the competition. The handling is great. This is no more an exercise in badge engineering than Lexus it to Toyota or Honda to Acura etc. You really need to drive it and look at the standard features. 15k at least under the competition similarity equipped. Leased for .9% here in Canada. Great deal."
saab,9-7x,2009,dukeu, 05/22/2010,Great Luxury SUV,4,"This SUV is fun to drive, and handles superbly in the snow. The price for a used one is incredibly low. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone that wants luxury, and all the equipment.  Everyone compliments the exterior design and appearance. And those who ride in it want to know where to buy one."
saab,9-7x,2009,NewSaabist, 03/03/2009,Can't beat the value!,4,"I just recently purchased a new 9-7x.  I have to say that I would not have looked at this vehicle if I had to pay the sticker price of $43,000, but with $17,000 in rebates and other incentives this vehicle is a great value.  I already have a Trailblazer so I am familiar with the platform.  As you might expect the Saab is much nicer on the inside and has much better handling.  The only knock is the fuel economy but I knew this from the Trailblazer.  If you can get the rebates and incentives and you're in the SUV market, I think this SUV is worth a look.  "
saab,9-7x,2009,just right, 04/12/2009,Good SUV value,4,"Due to the incentives and rebates I was able to purchase a 9-7X brand new for 25,000. For the price this is an outstanding value for this vehicle considering it comes with a 50,000 mile warranty. Comfortable, fun to drive and the interior is better than the other SUV's I tested costing much more. The six cylinder has ample power and it handles the road better than the 4-Runner I owned.  I know people like to point out that this is not a ""true"" SAAB.  However, this is not a a typical GM offering either. For the price I did not find a better mid-sized SUV."
saab,9-7x,2009,Thomas Coffeepa, 02/14/2010,9 7x - 5.3,4,"Great SUV.  Performance and handling are like no other SUV I have driven.  We test drove both the 6 and 8 cylinder, and opted for the 8.  Fuel economy was not much different between 6 or 8 so we went for the power.  Wise choice.  The V-8 power together with all wheel drive is fantastic."
saab,9-7x,2009,cruzebabuze, 09/14/2018,9-7x aero is the way to go,5,"ok so we had 2 Saab before, regular saloon cars. I daily drive a new corvette C7 and my wife daily drive range rover. we got tired of range rover as it is always having some weird stuff happening to it and my wife wanted something sportier. So we decided to buy a Saab 9-7s aero, because of the LS2 corvette motor. Let me put it in just one phrase: When I can not be in my C7 because I need to tow or get something big, I drive gladly my Saab 9-7x aero, because it feels like corvette made an suv. I kid you not, if you are a gear head/track guy like me, and you dont want to spend 130k in a pepper super turbo bla bla bla Porsche and want a more comfortable ride in a super fast suv, then you need to get yourself one of these Saab 9-7x aero, you will not regret it. it is super fast if you know how to squeeze throttle properly, it brakes fine and yes the pedal does not have that much travel or exotic car feeling, but it should not as it is a race suv, it just be less travel and more foot pressure. yes it is stiff like a sport car, so unless you have a gear head wife like me, your wife wont like it as it does not drive like a clumsy suv. interior is exactly what I was looking for, spacious, incredible leather and we own a range rover so we can compare and it is has good  as range rover. the console as a touch screen more responsive than in my C7, cargo is great and gauges is just what I needed. again it is very stiff for a SUV, so if you are buying it for your wife, make sure she drives it first. the outside looks good but could be a little better, but paint with sprinkles is just great. And what can I say it has an LS2 motor, so when you push throttle things happened. obviously gas consumption is has bad as a range rover, almost as bad.  Overall I would say, if you have the cash and find a Saab 9-7x Aero, buy it, dont think about it buy it.
"
saab,9-7x,2009,Wayneg, 07/23/2019,A disappointment,3,"Bought used with 22k in 2012. Just traded in on new truck (NOT GM). Very fun to drive, great suspension, great A/C, brakes last until 110k, rare (saw 5 others in 7 years), nice seats, drives like a truck. The bad- 15.7 mpg, lots of repairs (motor for AWD, exhaust manifold, full of electrical gremlins), depreciation. "

subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Candy Larsen, 06/11/2019,Best Car Ever!,5,"Bought my 2006 used from a dealer.  I drive up to 800 miles a week.  This SUV has NEVER had a single issue.  With time, I have replaced the life gate support which I popped in myself and I do the wipers myself.   Contrary to other comments regarding oil changes and service needed to be done at a dealer is bogus.  I now have over 200K on this SUV and recently had my cats replaced and the bushings replaced, all at a cost of under $800.  That is the most expensive repair to date and is to be expected with that much mileage.  I will be buying another Subaru, but not for awhile.  With regular maintenance and assurance from my mechanic, I know this SUV is good for another 200K.  The acceleration and MPG is fantastic.  Thanks Subaru!

subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,ob108, 06/20/2013,Timing Chains break - No support from Subaru,3,"This comment is dated, but I was looking for a recall notice. While your story is not a good one, here is one better. Less than 84000 miles on it when the timing chain fails. That cause the cam gear to fail and the dealer says they don't replace timing chains they replace motrs if they fail Scary I thought. I fix it and $2400 lighter it was running again only to find out that the main bearing was damaged and cannot be fixed. That's why the replace motors. You would think that Subaru would stand behind one of their most expensive models. Nope I am on my own. To them I thank them for eduacating me that I will never trust them again. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,pbfoot, 04/29/2015,Our Experience After 6 Years & 70k Miles,3,"True and unbiased. Picked up our B9 Tribeca in 2009 with 30k miles as a family car for a young, active family. Drawn in by its AWD, NAV, DVD and 7-Passenger seating. Drove until 2015 with 100k miles. Car was mostly reliable until recently when the problems forced us to unload. It originally felt solid, well built, safe, with a quiet interior. Over time, its weaknesses became apparent, and shakes and rattles piled up. I agree with others' headlight complaint. So poor it was dangerous to drive at night. Service is expensive. The car is so rare that dealer service and oil changes are a must. Suspension and drivetrain components started needing replacement by 100k. 100% would not buy again."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Bianca, 02/27/2018,Great...for a while.,3,"Bought this car used in 2013 with about 78k. This was the first car I bought on my own! Previously had a 1998 Chevy cavalier (my first car I got in high school)! The subaru was a 7 passenger, limited, grey interior, with navigation. I LOVED this car when I first bought it. It was comfy, roomy, and had everything I needed and more! In 2015 my check engine light came on, the car would shake horribly, and completely struggled to accelerate...uh oh! But, problems are to be expected in a 9 year old car! Took it to a local shop to see what the problem was. Store owner claimed to love this vehicle and knows all about them...yeah...! Told me it was the battery connection and changed the battery for me. Great! Check engine light turned off, shaking stopped, accelerating went back to normal.  I’m good to go, or so I thought. Nope! I live in Nebraska and the weather can change at the drop of a hat. Began raining one day, about two weeks later, and all the problems came back. Took it back to the shop twice before they decided to shut down their store without notice and without actually fixing the problem. Cool, what a waste of $500. Whatever, problem came and went as the weather changed for over a year. Weird, but apparently this vehicle is notorious for that, according to other reviews and subaru forums. Fast forward to 2017. The problem continued to come and go, but now the car was over heating and air conditioning wasn’t working (in the awesome heat of the summer - had upper 90’s this summer). Yay! Took it to multiple Subaru mechanics and NO ONE I mean NO ONE could figure out the problems. Kept driving, probably dumb, but oh well. Finally the power steering went out...while I was getting onto the highway. Let it sit for two weeks or more while I looked at buying a car. Well, as I was taking it in to be traded in it literally shut off, like the entire thing. Wouldn’t drive, lights turned off, compass on rear view mirror had all the lines flashing with it making no actual letter, wouldn’t accelerate, and lord knows what else was happening (I was in panic mode because I was on a main road). Finally had it towed to a local Subaru specialty shop and a NON-Subaru mechanic figured it out! Turns out the previous shaking was caused by a bad spark plug, like the wiring inside. The rest of the problems were caused by the serpentine belt going out (just under $300 for parts and labor). Car was back up and running, until about a month later when the check engine light came on again. Took it to autozone to check the code...it was the 3rd spark plug again which was causing me to drive on five cylinders instead of six. Light never turned off (since about November 2017), then started over heating again and the inside of the car was not warming up...aka, my windows wouldn’t defrost...in the middle of winter, cool, literally! Anyways, decided to go with a Honda CR-V this time around due to the massive headaches this thing was causing me. I turned in the keys with about 151k. Overall, it’s a good car, but left me with massive headaches when no one could figure out how to fix the problems. Last note, the car does not get 18/23 mpg. It’s more like 12/15. I was averaging 13 mpg since I drive highway (which bottlenecks during rush hour) and city. Will I buy a Subaru in the future, I don’t know. If I do, it’ll be a legacy or Forester or a more “popular” car because parts are VERY LIMITED in the States for this vehicle. Hope this was helpful for someone looking into this vehicle!

subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Unhappy, 04/29/2009,Huge Disappointment!,1,"Boy, am I disappointed and angry.  This B9 started breaking down at approximately 40,000 miles and has not run properly since, despite four trips to the dealership.  I lost all compression and had to have 2 Valve intakes, 2 valve exchanges, 13 o rings, and several gaskets replaced.  It took two breakdowns to get this fixed.  Now, one cylinder is not functioning.  The dealership is not wanting to admit that this is a lemon and replace it as they should.  I have contacted the national Subaru corporation for all the good it will do me.  Be careful if you buy this auto.  You too could get stuck with a lemon. "

subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,DaveD, 01/26/2006,Love it!,5,"We bought it to replace our Pontiac minivan.  We we're looking for 4WD/AWD, 7 usable seats and better gas mileage than Sequoias and Tahoes. We were torn between the Tribeca and the Pathfinder.  These were the only midsize SUVs in our opinion with usable 3rd row seats other than the Pilot.  The Honda Pilot's interior seems too plain, like a work car.  The Pathfinder drives like a truck.  We bought the Tribeca and love it! We've already been on a 400 mile trip in the Tribeca and the kids had no problem in the 3rd row.  Great car!  Fun to drive and we have all the room we need. Decent gas mileage for a AWD SUV and it drives more like a car.  We just wish it had automatic lights like GM cars."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,parrotfinalia, 06/02/2009,Having Second Thoughts,3,"Bought this to replace a Blazer with 112K. This has been in the shop more and for ""unknown issues"" than the Chevy ever was. Fell in love with the styling and the kick, but the electrical system is a joke. Mileage is better then the 99 Chevy and took a 3600 mile trip that was fun the entire way. This is my first Subaru but due to the ""unidentifiable"" mechanical issues, I doubt I will purchase Subaru again if the company does not stand behind their product. My love for the safety, quick response and original styling is being overshadowed by the maintenance issues that should not be happening in a car that is under the 50,000 mile warranty."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Roger, 05/23/2016,Becca is Best,4,"update: I still love my Tribeca B9. Still looks great, had the transmission flushed and shifting is fine once again. and Yes, I still get asked if it is new car - I think because people are not used to it and it is in great shape - green metallic with light tan leather interior. All of the safety warnings have been resolved in a positive way.
old review: I love my Tribeca, one of the best designed SUV's. Subaru was not bright to dump the designer of this set of 2006 cars - Jaguar picked him up. Car is not a fast off of the line car, but it does well otherwise. I have about 112000 miles on her and bought Becca used from a dealer when she had just under 60000. It had factory tow set up and we tow small trailers and once in a while a boat. it does well with both. The trans has been doing some odd down shifting waiting a bit too long before the shift and then needing to shift down two gears rather than one. I am often asked if it is a brand new car - a lot to say for a car that is 10 years old. I just was given a recall for hood latch - they do not have the part but ask me to wait until they come in - just hope the hood does not blow off (ha ha I think) It had another recall for puddle lights that also took a long time to come in, I got a new loaner from the dealer and drove that one fro several months. Dealer has been great about service - always washing the car after and doing very small things for free (example a plastic clip fell off, they just replaced it, no charge. My grandson stuck a CD in and jammed the entire player so it will not work, the dealer took it out but could ot get the cd out - said a new one was going to be $1000 so we just do not use the CD. Overall, I love the car.

subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Mari, 03/06/2009,Boring,2,"I enjoyed my SUV at first, but I've experienced numerous quirks the past year. My tire pressure light flashes off and on, regardless of the actual tire pressure. I've gotten to feel like every drive I make will end up with a flat tire, I'm getting paranoid. Even if the AC/Heat is off, I still feel air coming in from the outside. The radio volume goes up and down when it wants to. The seatbelt buzz is annoying, especially when I have to ""buckle up"" library books and the such.The door locks have been repaired and replaced 3 times. Any one else out there having these same problems or is it just my car???"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,rich, 10/11/2015,2006 tribecca,4,"just found headlights online and replaced ....installation was a snap as subaru put an access panel under car to get to the 3 screws....drive axils are a pain though
"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Hope Stewart, 03/28/2009,"Love the car, HATE the headlights!",4,"This is a great car. Very comfortable, great ease in getting in and out of car. Smooth ride, fun to drive except at night. Low beam headlights are horrible, especially in rural Montana with not streetlights, just a lot of deer. Extremely dangerous! I have to drive with high beams to see, but this is not always possible with oncoming traffic and weather conditions. We have taken it to Subaru shop several times and another mechanic, and nothing can be done. If I had test driven this car at night, I wouldn't have bought it. The lights take away from all of the great things that I love about this car. I am afraid to drive it at in the dark, but I have to in the winter. Car is dangerous at night!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,DLS, 05/21/2005,Final pick,4,"Sorry, will pick up Tribeca in 2 days. Just arrived on showroom floor today - but did take a 1 hour test drive. For 2 months have looked at Mercedes C & E, BMW 5, Audi A4&6, MDX, RX330, and Volvo XC70. MDX getting mixed reviews and low mileage for 45K. RX330 is plush with nice features but again 45K with Navigation. Mercedes, BMW and Audi getting mediocre marks from CR on reliability. FINALLY found a car with the right features and performance for the right price. This car is as quiet as the RX330. Zero road noise and a whisper of wind noise at 70 mph. Hwy MPG = mid-20's. Excellent radio, Nav, AWD, loaded with safety features and (hopefully) Subaru's good rep. Car is tight, responsive and solid."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Janice, 07/22/2010,Headlights are horrible,2,I am having a horrible time with headlights. Very little light and hard to see about 12 to 15 feet in front of car. Had headlights adjusted multiple times. So frustrating. Anyone have this problem?
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,OM, 04/17/2010,Satisfied,4,"Bought this car in 2005. Handles the Michigan snow great. One of the best handling cars out there. The engine is a little weak for the size of the car and the gas mileage is poor for a 3.0 liter. Interior is nice and comfortable, and quality is good. If maintained properly the car will be in great mechanical condition.    "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,jcp6, 03/05/2014,best car i ever owened,4,never had a issue with this vehicle. as long you keep up with regular oil changes etc... good family vehicle extra seats come in handy. handles really well especially in snow. 
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,marianne7214, 03/02/2012,Disappointed in Subaru,3,"I like my Tribeca overall, however, I am extremely disappointed to find out that I need new bushings (like many other owners with a low mileage car).
This would appear to be something that should be recalled, however, SOA has yet to do so.
Dealer cost to replace bushings is over $1000.
I was also disappointed to find out how hard it is to get/install anything for the car (windshield wipers, replace light bulb).
Windshield wipers aren't available at auto parts stores and light bulb took dealership mechanic over 30 mins to install."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Door Locks, 04/07/2009,Door Locks,4,"It's fun vehicle to drive, but I have door locks.  First it was the driver side front door lock that is not working.  After few months I found out now it's the front passenger side door lock is not working and recently I found that rear passenger side door lock is not working also.  I tried dealership to repair it, but due to mileage on it I have to pay $350 for each lock.  NO OTHER ISSUES.  Does anyone has this problem?  Can this be a defective locks from the manufacturer?"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,FirstSubie, 05/31/2005,Wow...from Subaru?,5,"This vehicle is truly a refreshing drive considering all the other SUVs I have owned.  I think the thing that will blow you away is the interior.  The fit and finish and design is on par with our Teutonic friends from Germany.  It almost has a ""cockpit"" like feel from a fighter jet and the electroluminescent gauges are awesome.  Also, get the ""puddle"" lights.  They really finish the vehicle off nicely!  The Boxer motor is amazingly smooth as is the tranny.  Shifts are seamless and road/wind noise is non-existent.  The driving experience is very pleasing.  The Boxer motor provides a low center of gravity so you have sharp/precise handling, not ""tippy"".  Sports car handling with SUV clearance!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,drjochen, 10/13/2005,We like it a lot,4,We have has the car for 2 months now and we like it a lot. It is very solid and doesn't drive as bad as your standard SUV/minivan. It drives more like a passenger car. It also roomy inside without having the monster size of some SUVs.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,The Davis', 02/23/2020,My 06 B9 Tribeca all wheel drive 7 passenger,5,"Well my wife and I are extremely happy with our tribeca. It has 300k miles on it it still has massive power. Rides great .all wheel drive is a monster and come rain, snow, or mud. It doesn't matter. The subaru B9 tribeca is going places that other's won't. ....only thing we lost remote to DVD player and it is a little pricy. All N all we love it .we trust it's safety and durable. 
"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,chris, 04/13/2010,Bushings replaced 2x,2,"Well we have 70,000 miles on our B9 Tribeca. We have had to replace the stabilizer bar bushings (under warranty) and today control bar bushings. We are not under warranty any more so it wasn't covered. The repair helped but there is still a knocking underneath where my feet are. Not as bad as it was thou.  I like the car but these issues SOA should do a recall on them and the headlight issue. You can not see at night. Its like a shade is pulled over your headlights half way and the only way to see far is with them put on high beams. Its a comfortable car. Gas mileage could be better. This expensive of a car these issues should of been taken care of. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,E, 01/21/2010,So-So,3,"We have owned this for a year now and I somewhat wish we had something else.  We have two kids and were used to a 4Runner which has A LOT more room than the B9.  Fuel economy is horrible, and it really only likes 89 or higher.  The heated seats are nice as well as the DVD.  The interior is also pretty cool, however, that is about it.  We are running into some mechanical problems now.  The engine is making some sort of loud rattle every time you throttle from a stop.  All in all, just so-so."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,MJ, 08/11/2010,Disappointed,2,"Interior is so comfortable and it has all the bells and whistles.  However, the performance is horrible.  When attempting acceleration at any speed including highway entering the engine revs to almost 7000 rpm before it kicks in and sometimes I can have the pedal floored and it still doesn't accelerate. Like others mentioned there is a problem with the headlights and poor visibility. Also, blind spots are very dangerous, almost hit 2 cars. And tire pressure light has been an issue since day 1.  Goes off for a day after filling tires and then starts flashing again.  Had a 2005 Ford Escape with 170K miles, should have stuck with Ford."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,sewel, 12/18/2010,Good vehicle but poor dealer service,4,"My Tribeca has been a great car but factory dealer service was terrible- On my way home from their shop the dashboard lit up like a xmas tree- with only 40k miles it needed some regular service. They reported to me that the electic wire harness was faulty-critters had chewed it and it need to be replaced at more than $1000- was told it was a common occurance on Tribecas???? This one is parked inside athome so wtf- Since that visit the car has had many new problems my advise is to keep away from the Subaru dealer in Plano, TX when times are hard some people go beyond to create more business "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Cracked Knuckles, 04/19/2019,Subaru 3.0 H6 engine.,2,"A common problem of the 3.0 engine:  Passenger side cylinder head cracks in the middle cylinder.  (Try to find a used, right cylinder head anywhere in the country.  Very hard to find.  Left side heads are easy to find.)

Watch, and clean your MAF often to avoid lean running, and elevated temps.  High temps will crack your head!

subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Paul, 11/29/2008,2006 Subaru B9 Tribeca Ltd.,4,"Good ride, sturdy, comfortable (important for me as I drive 2 hours a day)."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,MeMe, 06/13/2009,Perfect Vehicle,5,"This vehicle has met everyone of my needs and then some.  I went from a Mountaineer which I liked for space but hated for gas. The Tribeca surprised me in how much room was in the back for loading and hauling.  It is quiet (I drive interstate for work), smooth, and looks great.  I have had minor wear and tear problems (what car doesn't) but everything has been covered by the warranty and been fixed immediately. I also get great gas mileage (have never seen it under 18 in town) and I am not overly-cautious or a slow driver! I plan on owning this car for many many years!!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,T Jenks, 09/28/2005,Great car for the money,5,"My other car is a newer Cadillac, and I have only driven it once since I got my Tribeca 8 weeks ago.  If you don't want a speeding ticket, you need to use the cruise control.  This is a very well engineered car, that you know as soon as you close the door and take it for a test drive.  I was looking at the Outback just for winter driving and skiing.  Test drove the Tribeca, and was sold immediately.  Test drove the Murano, and RX330, and I believe the Tribeca has much more bang for the buck."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Luis, 07/25/2006,Great crossover,4,"The lease of the Tribeca is one of the best secrets in the market. This vehicle gives you everything you want in a crossover. Great performance and handling, I would just make the engine a bit bigger than the 3.0, everything else is an absolute 10."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,ROB, 06/20/2005,A great addition!,4,"Let me begin by saying I finally found the sport version of mom's soccer van.  From the moment you enter the the well thought out cabin and take a seat behind the whee, the ergonomically correct dashboard and steering wheel seem to wrap themselves around you but still let you know you are in control."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Diana Dunn, 07/17/2005,Tribecta Review,4,"I fell in love with looks of this SUV the minute I saw it. The car is real comfortable and looks great.  I love the moon roof.  It has the navigation system but I haven't had time to really learn it yet.  However, I bought it because I haul around 4 grandkids all the time as well as I am a realtor and I wanted room for passengers.  However, it is a tight squeeze to put more than four people in this vehicle.  Three is really more comfortable.  The worst part of this car is the extremely poor gas mileage.  I thought being it was a 6 cyl. that I would get much better gas mileage than the Lincoln Towncar I traded in to lease this.However I get only 15.6 miles per gal.  Also you must use 91% oct."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Adrian Rivera, 08/09/2005,And I thought my Outback wagon was fun!,4,"This  is a great car. I was initially put off by the price tag until we did our comparison research & test drives. All of the comparably equipped competitors came in over the price I ultimately negotiated my dealer. It handles great and has much more power than my 4 cylinder Outback wagon.  It has an excellent turning radius and is very easy to park . My only complaint is the gas mileage but we expected this moving up to a 6 cylinder SUV. We love both the interior and exterior styling of the car. It is definitely a head turner and I, only having it for short time, have been asked about it numerous times."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Drake, 08/20/2005,Love it!,4,"This has been a great few weeks, drives with comfort and luxury. Handles Pennsylvania bumpy roads well, no more backache!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Karen in AZ, 10/18/2005,I love it more every day!,4,"This is a major upgrade from my previous vehicles ('05 Outback, '99 Forester, '92 Legacy). I looked at various other mid-sized SUVs, including the more expensive luxury makes, but this was an easy choice. The legroom, ride comfort, seat height, quietness, rear AC fan/vents, acceleration, and low entry/exit are the main reasons I bought this vehicle. After owning it for over 4 months, and 8400 miles, I can honestly say I love it! I have taken it on everything from extended interstate miles to various back roads and forest services roads, and it has performed beyond my expectations. If it proves as reliable as the other Subies I've owned, I'll be keeping this one for a very long time!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Don Morris, 12/02/2005,Wow...what a Subie,4,Subaru has done it again.  What a class act the B9 Tribeca is.  We drove it on a vacation to the OBX of North Carolina and the car performed like champ.  The NAV system worked flawlessly.  Note: Drivers using SpeedPass should not keep it on your keyring.  It interferes with the ignition sequence and causes the engine to lock up for 10 minutes.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Dr. Dave, 08/25/2006,AWD nice - short on details,4,"We had driven the Lexus RX 330 and Acura RXD and found both superior in ride and quality. However the price on those 2007 models was prohibitive, and Subaru was promoting a nice finance incentive for the 2006 B9s. I thought the B9 was overpriced at $37K, but at $30K with the navigation system, we thought it was fair. It's a beautiful body design and the power train is efficient. Those wide tires will grip anything, especially nice for the wife's winter Michigan drives. Driving it is noisy as it's not as baffled as our Lincoln LS sedan. The sound system sounds a little hollow too, but it is adequate. The ride was bumpy, and we now found out that all 4 tires are out of balance, needing 2 new."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,dsmyers, 01/13/2007,A complete Ride?,4,"This ride met all criteria when we purchased. At least we thought so. It was advertised and listed on the sticker to get 18 city 23 MPG highway. The highest we have seen is 16.9 MPG. Bums me out that I didn't verify this before we purchased. We have to set aside some extra $$ in budget for gas. Also, we can't be the only ones. There is something very different with the low beams. It displays a broken line in front of you. The Subaru factory said that's the way it is. Subaru dealer said we were not first the TB9 owners to make this claim. It is a flaw I tell you. Subaru (everyday is a winding road). A dark winding road can be dangerous one.  During the day it is a very sturdy, safe ride."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,aok, 03/14/2007,hazardous headlights,3,"Nice look and ride in daylight.  Very dangerous low beam headlights.  We had it checked out and service said that's the normal operating characteristic.  Can't see 10 feet in front going down a hill at night.  Flawed design-needs safety recall.  Another Tribeca owner said it's like a horizon line right across your vision.  It's a notched line, pitch dark on top.  Need to drive with high beams on-creates another safety issue for oncoming cars.  Poor, hazardous headlight design.  Service has heard it lots-why don't more bring it up?"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Deep, 05/15/2007,"Fun to drive, premium gas a problem",4,"After driving a 1990 Legacy, I switched to 2006 Tribeca. Now that I think of it, I have both Subies in their 1st year of mfg. It is fun to drive. So far driven 6000 miles. Pretty comfortable in long drive. Although not suitable for off-road driving, it is very nice ride on rough roads. Took it on a 500 mile drive recently. Only concern is its use of premium gas and also the pick up of the engine. It takes some time and the engine revs up with a lot of noise. But they are changing it in 08 models with a better engine."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Chris V, 07/05/2009,"Subaru Tribeca, great car, under-rated",4,"I love my B9 Tribeca, great SUV overall. The only problem it seems is the color of my SUV, I have the 2006 Gold, it's a light color gold, and it seems to have some kind of damage to the color, like it's lighter in some areas. I don't know what this is... BAD PAINT or SUN DAMAGE? Hmm. :/"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,A. Grupp, 05/16/2010,Underwhelmed,3,"Overall, while I like the car and feel very safe driving it, I have been disappointed with a few issues. First, I agree with others citing the headlights as an issue. Not only is the low beam ineffectual, but I have had to replace the bulbs numerous times. Second, the heating has failed so I will need to spend $1K+ to fix it. And,now,the A/C is an issue. Third, there is a blind spot on the passenger side due to the small rear window. Fourth, the electrical system has been causing problems. I am sold on Subarus, just not on the Tribeca. I own a Forester and have owned the Outback. Love/loved both. Will revert to one of them moving forward."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,zoomer, 09/08/2010,Stylish 7-seater,4,"Purchased new in '05. Reliability has been good, none of the issues reported by others. Performance is fine for an SUV. Third row comes in handy now and then for our small children and others. Weren't many 7 seat options back then (not MDX, Highlander, etc.) and we didn't want the mega SUV or minivan. Overall, happy with the experience."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Jackson W., 10/21/2005,Tribeca is the best,5,"Subaru is a very unusual brand for me but after taking the new Tribeca for 24 hours test drive I could not stop my self and bought one. Unbelievably stylish, great performance, nice features, great fuel economy. It is so luxurious, and comfortable. It changes the everything about the SUV we know."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Indiogoa, 07/30/2006,Tribeca B9 is a winner!,4,"We checked out several SUVs in this size class before buying, including the Murano, Highlander, RX300 and Pilot. This SUV outclassed all of them for interior and exterior styling, performance and overall value. We are impressed with the handling and ride of the Tribeca; it is fun to drive and handles tight curves with little or no body lean. Our Tribeca gets about 22MPG highway with four passengers and camping gear, about 17.5MPG around city. It cruises well on the highway. The third row is cramped, fine for very small kids. But for our family of four, the third row serves as a cargo hold. The sound system and DVD are outstanding as our all the extras, heated seats etc. Overall, this is a great SUV."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Marilyn H, 12/07/2006,It's ok---nothing fancy tho!,3,"The gas mileage is over-estimated, as is the quietness inside. I wonder because I see so few Tribecas around if I should have bought something more common."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Paul, 01/31/2016,awesome snow machine,4,"I like it. This is my first run with Subie. I am very nervous only because I've always drive VW or Audi. First day tire pressure light, and most there after. We baught an unlimited mileage warranty due to the fact that is is used. Washer reservoir froze. It doesnt shift worth a damn durring acceleration, but thats ok because i like the sport shifting anyway, not really an auto tranny fan. Gas mileage sucks, tank is tiny. No bluetooth, unless i want to pay someone to install aftermarket. But my kids love the room. I took my 6'4"" neighbor for a ride in the back seat and he loved it. To be honest ive never been in a car where if the seat was all the way back i couldnt reach the pedals, pretty awesome if u ask me ive got really long legs short upper body. It is as solid in snow as any of my Audi's if not stronger. I think it actually handles better in snow than on dry ground. Had to do headlight about a week after i baught it. But i knew it was going when i baught it, and to be perfectly clear is easier to change Subie bulb than a chevy trailblazer's. I think that the so called handy men posting are not so handy. All in all it has kwerks. But it is used, thats why we got warranty. We baught it for upstate NY snow and it does its job... WELL! Now for the kicker. My wife went to pick up dinner. Was in the restaurant maybe 5 min. Came out car clicks but wont start. I went up to parts store grabbed a battery thinkin our winter has killed old one...... Still clicking. Never fear our warranty is here. But i am worried about this being a Subie thing. I wanted this to be my daughters first car. Hope i didnt make the wrong choice by switching for Wolfburg
"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,PEB, 07/04/2009,Nice Family Vehicle,4,"This s.u.v. is as close to my dream vehicle as I will get for a while. Beautifully designed in and out and comfortable. The only 2 things that is a very small minus is that the wipers have to be bought from Subaru unless you change the whole arm...can't fit flex or other types of wipers. Second, the power in the first generation tribeca, the B9, is a bit low for hwy passing, but still does the job. Overall...would recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a four dour. We love it...beats a tiburon when you have kids!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Donna, 10/31/2009,"Oh, my Tribeca!",4,"I bought this SUV used and I was kind of wary about buying used, but this SUV makes all that worry go away. I love that I can warm myself with the heated seats. That my kids have tons of space in the back. My husband loves driving it and changing from automatic to manual. Great family vehicle. Excellent trunk space. Not to mention you don't see them much here in Long Beach, California since I bought it I've only seen 3 on the road."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Erik, 11/22/2009,Amazing,4,"I love this vehicle, it has given me zero problems and I've owned it since new, Just took an 8K mile trip to colorado (from mn) without any issues, the 3.0 climbed pikes peak without breaking a sweat, what a treat it is to own this vehicle.  I work at a subaru dealer and see these vehicles come in from time to time, but not for any types of problems, only for routine maint. I would buy another in a heartbeat. This is currently my 2nd subaru, my other is an impreza (1996) with 250K miles, and has been turboed since 100K miles. These cars are indestructible!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Jaap, 12/23/2009,Great Car!!,4,Just bought a Tribeca after test driving several SUV's. The final choice was between a Murano and the Tribeca. I was able to get a great deal on the Tri (maybe due to the bad reviews on looks). This car is great!  Moved from Texas to Massachusetts and needed a car that would be safe in the snow . Just survived my first snow storm and this car handles suburb. Especially the guided traction control helped me out in some slippery situations. 3rd row is a joke but it is made up for by the double sliding middle seats. I'm 6'3'' and the legroom in the back seat is great. Power is at higher RPM (by design) so don't be afraid to rev it up when needed. I found the 250 hp to be sufficient. 
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Michele, 08/15/2005,Power Steering gone after 300 miles,3,"Three days after I bought my Tribeca, the power steering went out. I had to have it flat bedded back to the dealer. The fluid reservoir is full, no leaks, the belts are fine. I guess I will find out how good this dealer is in how they treat me through this. I just hope it is not something that will happen again and that they fix it right. I LOVED the car before this happened and will probably love it again when it is fixed and I feel confident it will not happen again."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,John Giambalvo, 08/29/2005,To drive a B9 is to want a B9!,4,"I happened upon the B9 while out driving other vehicles in its class.  It was the fifth drive in less than a week.  After about twenty seconds, I knew this was a superior ride to all of the previous ones. In the three weeks since taking it home, it has only reinforced my decision. I wait for the chances to drive it. I can't wait for snow to come. It's obvious that Subaru knows AWD given the incredible popularity of the Outback. The B9 is an utterly new level of Subaru. The cockpit is even fun to just be sitting in. I warn you, if you take for a test drive, you will want to take it home."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,HJD, 07/17/2005,Love our new car!,4,"First new car we've bought in twelve years, so it was a big decision.  My husband is a car nut, and swore he was not going to buy a Subaru.  But this won us both over.  We love it.  Very convenient, great interior design, very comfortable PLUS we are averaging 21 MPG (we live in a large city, so this is amazing to us).  Test drive it and you just might buy it."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Laura, 11/02/2008,I Hate To Give It Up,4,"Love my Tribeca, my lease is over and I am getting an Acura MDX the acceleration on the Subaru wasn't enough for me very safe vehicle and great paint, the car looks and drives like brand new after 3 yrs. of ownership. I wish they would build a bigger Subaru that was more roomy I have 2 boys and the 4 of us just grew out of this truck. If you travel a lot get the luggage rack because it is a tight squeeze in the back. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Lisa Mulen, 05/27/2005,Exciting and Fun New Vehicle,5,I just purchased my new Subaru and I absolutely love it.  It is fun to drive and comes with great features.  Great set up on the dash.  This is my first Subaru and I was impressed with the dealership.  For the past ten years I have had various Suburbans and I am very excited and pleased with this change.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,seer, 06/02/2005,Just off the lot,4,"We were floored when we saw the car on the dealer's lot. We were there to have our previous Outback serviced and knew the Tribeca was coming soon but seeing one in person cemented the deal. The car has everything you could want in a mid-size SUV. The power is excellent. The looks are terrific. We have the 5 seat version and the interior is excellent. There is plenty of room with an especially spacious back seat area. We have the 5 speed auto and I like to drive in the sport mode which gives you a little more torque between shifts. All in all, a home run for Subaru. If you can find one, go get one now!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Lisa Mullen, 06/14/2005,Love this Vehicle,5,I purchased my Tribeca three weeks ago after driving a Suburban for the past 8 years and I love it!  It is very comfortable and easy to get in and out of.  It has plenty of power for the mountain roads.  I especially love the DVD Player for our kids.  The trip to our cabin this past weekend was the quietest trip we have ever had.  Since purchasing my Tribeca I have had four people stop me and ask what it was and just the other day found a doctor peaking into the windows while I had it parked in the parking lot.  He liked it so much I ended up opening the doors to let him take a look at it.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Ron, 06/25/2005,Excellent Value,4,"Subaru has hit a home run with the Tribeca.  The build quality is excellent.  It has all the features one could ask for in this type of SUV.  Good performance.  Low interior noise.  It has 18"" wheels and is very responsive.  Since it's a brand new model just delivered, I can't rate reliability, but my experience with Subarus has been excellent. Thus far performance and fun-to-drive factors for the Tribeca exceed my expectations. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,John, 06/26/2005,A fun ride!,4,"I have been looking for just the right vehicle that will fit my 6'6"" body, be comfortable, get reasonable gas mileage for a small SUV and be fun to drive at a reasonable price.  The Subaru B9 is just that car.  I look forward to driving this vehicle each day as it truly is comfortable for a tall person. Although it is a bit lacking in 0-60 acceleration it has more than enough power to make the driving experience fun.  Both the interior and exterior are refined and stylish.  Some have complained about the front end being ugly but I will bet it will grow on people the longer it is out.  I love it!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Chris, 06/28/2005,Great car,4,"It is a wonderful vehicle which floats down the road.  Takes bumps with no apparent shaking or noise.  Very quiet.  Inside the front seat is like an airplane cockpit.  Heated mirrors, side windows and wipers make it perfect for the colder climates. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Emma, 06/28/2005,Excellent Choice,5,Amazingly a good value with extra features and good performance. Safety rated and safety features make this an outstanding value. Comfortable interior with the luxury of a car and the space of a midsize SUV...very happy.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,junochoe, 07/10/2005,Drove it and I was sold,4,"I have owned the Tribeca for about three weeks and I am continuously amazed. When we first test drove it, I noticed how smooth this SUV's boxer engine revs and how much willingness it has on acceleration. I also did some crazy turns in a parking lot and I noticed minimum body roll and solid grip during acceleration from the Tribeca's AWD. Recently, I took my Tribeca on slick and wet winding roads at about 45 mph, and the Tribeca kept its composure. At no time did I feel excessive body roll or loss of traction. This is one fun car to drive!  The exterior is a bit funky, but I've learned to love it. Also, the interior is pretty space-age but very comfortable."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,L. Frank, 07/27/2005,"Goodbye Old ML, Hello B9 Tribeca Ltd 7",4,"So impressed by test driving B9 Tribeca Ltd. 7 passenger we bought it 2 days later; our first non German make in 25 years.  Went from ML to B9 - after comparing every detail interior, performance and fact that almost every option is included in 7 passenger Ltd price were options on others sold us.  Especially comfort, handling ease, safety feats.  Not as tall as ML, Lexus GX470, Z3 we tested but what we got for price -- impressive.  Hope to embrace B9 unusual exterior styling. Interior superb- driver's ""cockpit"" design, ease in reading well positioned dash instruments.  Good mileage, great cornering & handling, smooth ride, A+ rear seat comfort  & A/C controls & 20k less than ML with equal options. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,weglit_mh, 08/13/2005,Superior SUV,4,"a dream to drive!! Subaru has outdone themselves. I can hardly wait to find an excuse to take the car out on  a drive.  Even driving in traffic is ""fun"".  distinctive and appealing exterior design."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,J Lu, 08/16/2005,Who Knew Suburu,4,"Suburu wasn't even on my carbuying radar until this SUV came along. Fell in love immediately after the test drive: great looks, lots of power, smooth ride, great handling. Easy transition for me from a '93 Toyo4Runner. Packed with features - this is the best SUV to get in the market for its value. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,CWhyte, 08/17/2005,Tribeca Wins with Fun Ride,4,"August 2005: We compared and test drove new Subaru B9 Tribeca, Highlander LDT, Honda Pilot, Acura MDX, Nissan Murano, Infinity FX3,and used Lexus RX300.   Final Round was between MDX & Tribeca. Tribeca won for us. Here's why:  Better handling, especially in sudden high speed manuvers. Slight lean never gets worse than slight. Quick, accurate steering and shifting response. 255/55/18 Tires w/ 18"" wheels contribute.  Fun to Drive: Std auto trans adds ""sport"" mode AND "" Manual mode"". Zoom. (But Murono 'shiftless' trans is cool!)  Ground clearance: 8.4"" allows a some off road adventure confidence.  Features & doo-dads: All the rest being about equal or better than the competitors."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Andrea, 08/28/2005,Tribeca,4,Please test drive on the freeway before you purchase if a lot of road noise or wind noise is bothersome to you.  You have to turn up the radio loudly and speak loudly if you drive more than 50 mph because of wind and road noise.  Also don't count on this car to get out of the way of a speeding truck coming towards you.  NAV system not that reliable.  Don't bother paying extra for it.  Drives more like a truck than expected.  A big truck.  Gas mileage is so so for a truck.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,anframm, 08/31/2005,Subaru Tribeca,4,"Averaging slightly over 20 miles to the gallon in combo driving, brakes a little mushy, handling and ride exemplary (better than any others I have been in), good dealer experience, power is good (engine is adequate and power delivery is smooth) though another 25 to 30 lb/ft torque would not hurt."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,DannyD, 08/31/2005,This vehicle ROCKS!,4,"I have owned my Tribeca for 3 weeks now.  It rocks!  I just absolutely love it!  It has such a unique exterior, and the interior could not be better.  My commute is 1 hour each way, and the time flies by now.  (I hope that feeling never wears off.)  The radio reception is incredible. The ability to play data CDs made with MP3 files is awesome.  I can put 13 CDs on 1 disk.  Who needs a CD changer if you can do that?  The ride is incredible.  I have never felt so connected to the road before.  This car is worth every penny.  If only gas prices didn't stink so bad."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Dave, 09/11/2005,Great Ride,4,I traded in my Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. I've only owned the Tribeca for a couple of weeks but so far I really enjoy driving it.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Bill, 09/29/2005,Sure thing,4,"I have been buying Subarus for years and find this one the cream of the crop. Handing is a bit soft, but the comfort, the small turning radius, the ""interesting"" styling, and the power to spare all combine to make it a first rate buy, even at a top Subaru price."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,cptplt, 10/08/2005,Why did it take Subaru so long?,5,"Surprisingly smooth and road holding tenacious in wet. If you need lots of room for a 5 seater but occasionally need 7 seats, this beats any minivan I have had before. Pickup more than adequate. Best build quality of any Subaru I have had and this is the 5th."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Paul Browne, 10/20/2005,Subaru Rocks,4,"I have owned this car for about four months now. This is my second Subaru. It's a great car, handles as good or better than many sports cars I have owned, is fairly quiet on the road, and yes, it can get good gas mileage (you have to drive gently). Commuting to and from work I get 20 to 22 mpg, with mostly highway driving. At high speed on the Interstates (75+) I get 19-21 mpg. The manual shift feature I use a lot when I'm driving in the mountains (NM), it saves the transmission from countless up and down shifts. The other vehicle I considered buying was a Cadillac SRX 7 pass. One test drive told me the B9 Tribeca was the best buy."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Sol Hornberger, 10/26/2005,"Tribeca, As Close To Perfect.....",4,The Tribeca is as close to perfect a car can get. It drives like a car. It has the room of an suv. It has the interior of a luxury car. The Tribeca has everything you want in a car and left out everything that you don't want in a car. I have to drive 1 hour each way to work and it is really comfortable. I did have a Cherokee Sport. My back hurt everyday and now it doesn't. This car is SWEEEEEEET!
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,DDillman, 11/01/2005,"Fun ""Car"" to Drive",4,"We have driven 6000 miles to date in the last 5 months.  This is a very fun ""car"" to drive.  My wife is 5'1"" and loves it. We looked at ALL of the other options out there.  Until this we could not look at Subaru due to the fact we use the 6+ passenger seating often. I still don't know how my 10 year old fits in the 3rd seat.  She says it's very comfortable.  As long as the family is happy so am I! What a fun car to drive, very sporty. I am looking forward to ski season to see how this vehicle does in the snow!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Randy M., 11/04/2005,Great Vehicle,5,"Had narrowed our choice to BMW X3 vs Subaru for safety reasons.  Was looking at LL Bean Outback when my wife saw the Tribeca.  Wow!  The driving performance is slightly below the BMW; however, it surpasses it in the overall package. Subaru does a tremendous job of equipping the vehicle with so many standard options.  Dealer experience was the best we have EVER had.  I had no idea Subaru made vehicles like this. Very impressed with the build quality, performance and luxury of the vehicle. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Ann Marie, 11/04/2005,So far lovin it,4,This is my first SUV purchase. After driving my husband's Ford Explorer around I knew I had to finally get rid of my old '99 Honda Accord. The Subaru Tribeca looks very modern and that is one of the reasons why I really like it. Inside the dash is amazing - simply beautiful. It is quite easy to drive and park (and I am not the best parallel parker). I love the solid feeling the Tribeca gives me. I feel very safe driving it.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,baddad303, 10/31/2005,Early Impressions,4,"Love the vehicle but....  Resonance vibrations when holding ~30 mph.  BAD buffeting when the rear windows only are down  and I do mean discomfort to the eardrums type buffeting!  CD player has already failed  mechanical failure message displays (mechanical error) not noted in the manual!  Dealer told us not to slam the back gate - it would break a cheap plastic latch - this was told to us after the purchase as we were leaving . :-/  Note that all the doors do shut with grace, very easily with little noise, just a little thing but another example of the inconsistent quality of components.  Weak radio of Wal-Mart quality - not a boomer by no stretch of the imagination."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,G.J. Pence, 11/09/2005,Rear Lift gate hydraulic jacks weak,4,"Purchased B9 in July/05 for an extra auto. Found the B9 great to drive, roomy, and very comfortable. After the past 120 days have found the rear lift gate hydraulic lifts are weakening and not performing well. Mileage is getting much better than when first purchased. Larger gas tank would be helpful to go further than just 300 miles on a tank of gas."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,jd4real, 11/10/2005,Blind Spots,3,"Design flaw that needs reviewing is blind spots. Bigger mirrors may help however there is a definite blind spot in the rear window area. Nice ride, great features but safety concerns."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Joe, 12/09/2005,B9 Divine,4,Traded a Tahoe for the B9. Runs well. Shifting is substandard since I live in hilly area.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Manoug Beurekjian, 12/14/2005,Awesome SUV from Subaru,4,"Overall the Subaru B9 Tribeca is a joy to ride and is quite amazing with a number of features standard. My wife was going to trade in her '99 Mercedes E320 and was looking to replace with an SUV. After looking at a number of SUV's, primarily German and Asian, I chose the all new B9 Tribeca because of the number of features that were standard and of higher quality materials than Nissan and other Asian manufactures. Being a loyal Volkswagen fan I was looking for something with a German look and feel without the price tag and problems of German. After the B9 Tribeca came out I was quite impressed with the press pictures and after driving it didn't even think twice, I bought it."

subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,b9 A+, 01/19/2006,B9 IS THE WAY TO GO!,5,"Vehicle is awesome inside and out. Handles awesome in bad weather, although scary on ice, but what vehicle isn't. IMO it's the best deal in its class. Some say it has a face that only a mother could love. Well call me Mommy, because I think this Subaru is one of the best looking SUV's out there."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Tom K, 01/23/2006,"Fun car to drive,",4,"I researched heavily against more expensive models: BMW X5, MDX and RX330.  The Tribeca beat them all for less and my first 1000 miles have been fun. The car is more comfortable than my 1999 Mercedes ML430 and handles better. The Tribeca also has more horsepower than the X5 and top safety ratings from safercar.gov.  In its first weather test for me it flew up an ice covered hill that other cars were stuck on."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,rc, 01/24/2006,Liking it more than I thought I would,4,"We tested everything on the market, from the RAV4 all the way up to the XC90, and chose the 7 passenger Ltd Tribeca, feeling it offered more for the money. We are new to the Subaru brand and enjoying the experience so far.  After a bad start, on purchase day, the car we originally leased broke down, but the dealership quickly replaced it. After 4 months of use, this car has really grown on me. Useless third row for anyone over 4 feet, but the fit, finish, ride and comfort are excellent. It fits two adults, two car seats and everything we need to pack easily without feeling overly large.  The handling is sharp and the all wheel drive and traction control systems are great"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,alpesh patel, 01/24/2006,good car for the money,4,"I had Volvo s40 2005. I had to give that car away and get the B9.  This car is very well put together and runs great. Yea one minor issue,  the gas.  It seems like it is giving me a 16 to 17 not 18 or 19 mpg.  But on the highway this car runs and is very quite.  Inside they have done their homework.  I love the boxer 3.0l engine.  Best so far."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Matthew, 02/02/2006,Best SUV Value for the Dollar,4,"I just leased a new '06 Tribeca Limited w/ Navigation.  I am in love with this car so far. This car is so much fun to drive, and the interior is one of the coolest I have ever seen in an SUV.  A great bonus is there aren't that many on the road yet, so it won't be like driving a Honda Pilot along with everyone else on the road.  For the money (Subaru is offering great deals on the Tribecas), you can't beat this SUV.  It has everything: Nav, leather, heated seats, sunroof, 6 CD changer, tons of airbags, etc.  Plus the car has plenty of power, and doesn't feel too ""big"" behind the wheel.  Add to all of this Subaru legendary build quality, and you MUST look at this SUV if in the market!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,John, 02/04/2006,B9 Tribeca,4,"After six months, am still very impressed with this vehicle.  Came out of an X5 and feel the Tribeca is closer to the drive feel of the X5 than the price difference suggests.  Extremely nice interior and nav system."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,taj, 02/06/2006,My Subaru,4,I leased this SUV in October. The interior is something from a spaceship. All my friends are in awe of my Subaru. When I first drove the car home no one knew what it was and people were honking at me amazed it was a Subaru. Needless to say I've seen many since that day and I don't blame them. This is a fun car with great handling and control. Snow? What snow? The radio pumps good sound and the touch screen navigation is the easiest I've ever used. My wife loves the heated seats and my daughter is kept under control with her favorite movies playing from the built in 9 inch screen. And I can listen to my music because of the wireless earphones. Bottom line is I love this car and you would to.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,RJBLUM, 02/06/2006,Tribeca,4,"My first Subaru and a great looking, fun to drive car. Lots of features and perfect for a smaller type of SUV. Gas mileage is so-so, comfort and roominess is great. Sound system in this model is excellent. All in all a very nice vehicle."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Nancy Jo, 02/28/2006,Love the Tribeca,4,I am thrilled with my Tribeca.  The interior and exterior are well designed.  It doesn't look like every other SUV on the road.  It handles well and has good power.  
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,cdubois1@, 03/26/2006,Beautiful Car!,4,The car is a genuine winner. It's my 10th Subaru and easily the best.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Carl Tordonato, 03/28/2006,Car Performance,4,"The engine is very sluggish, with slight acceleration of the gas pedal the engine hesitates then the transmission shifts down as if the engine loses power. I am very disappointed with the performance. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Cal Ramage, 04/08/2006,Repeat Subaru owner,4,"The driving experience has been excellent. Turning rate is a lot better than my previous Lexus LX 300. The little extras like lights in the cup holders, step lights, 4wd for confidence in slick conditions, adequate hp and seat arrangement to accommodate hauling things in the back are nice. Our dealership bends over backwards to make sure you come back to them with great service and free washes anytime."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Slonna, 04/09/2006,Best Deal for the Money,5,"Just bought Limited Tribeca with Nav/DVD ... and more. Rides great, in my opinion the best looking SUV currently out there, very well appointed-in/out. Came from a 800 mile trip and never got tired or boring driving it."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Daniel, 04/10/2006,Very nice!,4,"All I can say is this thing is great. We had a lot of rain here in Hawaii over the past few weeks and I never felt safer, and after the rain stopped I took it to the dealer to get washed they told me how people flocked in for a little AWD safety."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Shirley, 05/18/2006,Best Car On the Road,5,"I wanted a SUV like vehicle which allowed me to sit up higher and gave me good visibility.  Needless to say I found these qualities as well as many others it in the Tribeca.  It handles like a dream; comfortable/quiet ride; superior sound system, great adjustable seats."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Jim, 05/20/2006,owner,4,"Rated as being one of the safest vehicles on the road.  All wheel drive is beneficial in snow and wet conditions also.  Speed and performance is good for this type of vehicle.  Mileage is low - we get approx. 21 miles per gallon since owning the vehicle.   Wife is driving vehicle.  I'm not too pleased with the appearance of vehicle, but is handy with hatch and seats that go completely down.  Very reliable and no issues whatsoever with the vehicle.  GPS system is a great option if you travel frequently.  We use it quite frequently.   Kids enjoy seeing movies and makes the longer trips bearable for us also.  We simply run to the library and have them pick out a few cds to watch."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Joe Lopez, 06/04/2006,Best SUV Ever,5,"I love my Tribeca. it's great that its not everywhere. People say ""wow thats so beautiful, what is it?"" I love it. First Subaru. Forever Subaru."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,B9er, 06/15/2006,Love the B9,4,"Nearly 1000 miles on the Tribeca.  Plenty of room for baby car seat and cargo.  Everyone loves the interior styling, the Nav is great and easy to use. Everything is laid out intuitively.  Comfortable to drive and decent fuel economy for an SUV, ~20- 21mpg mixed. Gas tank is on the small side, which requires more frequent stops at the gas station.  "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Joanne, 06/17/2006,B9 Tribeca,5,"Picked up my Tribeca  today.  Very comfortable car and ride.  I was looking at this car for a while, even compared it to Murano, Tribeca has a smoother ride and the seats are more comfy. The inside is very impressive. Beautifully designed. Happy I choose the Tribeca. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,FuzzyJohn, 07/03/2006,Solid performer,4,"I live on a dirt road and the B9 Tribeca handles washboarding like a champ, feeling little vibration in the body or steering. On paved roads, the ride is smooth and gives minimal feeling of sway at moderate speeds. The look takes getting used to but it grows on you quickly. I enjoy the fact the controls and readouts are simple and easy to use. The seats are comfortable and I don't feel cramped with the amount of room in the front seat area. The rear leg room leaves something to be desired but the seats are deep and can be adjusted to give adequate room for knees. Overall, I believe it is equal to most luxury cars and a big improvement on every SUV and off-road vehicle I have driven."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Robert Brand, 07/25/2006,Beautiful B9 Tribeca,5,This vehicle is extremely pleasant to drive as it feels like you are in complete control at all times.  It is the most sure-footed car I have ever had.  So far most of the driving has been inside the city but the times outside on longer trips I found the navigation system to be very helpful.  After driving Cadillacs it took a bit of getting used to a high revving (7000rpm redline) engine.  To date absolutely no problems have showed up. I have the five passenger version.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Amber, 07/27/2006,"Great drive, bad mileage",4,"Love the car, hate the gas mileage. The nav system is awesome!  I love the feel of the drive.  Love the payout.  It feels safe and I don't find any issues with the acceleration.  Lots of room. Easy to load two big doggies in the back.   Anyone have ideas on how to improve MPG?  I have been using the premium gas."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,jb, 07/27/2006,my Tribeca,4,Really handles well on dirt roads.  Has plenty of pick up and go!  Love the extra leg room.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Dean, 07/27/2006,Brief Review,4,Nice vehicle so far.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Max, 08/07/2006,2006 Subaru B9 Tribeca Review,4,My first Subaru. Fun ride. Comfortable as it can get. Strong body. Streamlined design. Bad fuel efficiency.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,AM, 08/09/2006,Luv it so far,4,"Only 1800 miles so far and besides the gas mileage, I love the SUV.  Have the Nav system and never knew how helpful it would be.  Like sitting up high. Like the secure feel of the airbags and cage."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Dave, 08/09/2006,Nice Car,4,I have had the Tribeca for almost 1 year.  I have really enjoyed driving the car and have had no problems with the car.  The only reason to go back to the dealership was for regularly scheduled maintenance.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Dev Dawg 4 Life, 08/22/2006,Awesome Crossover SUV,5,"Have been driving SUV for almost 10 years and hit the jack-pot when I bought my Tribeca.  Drives like a car with a SUV feel.  Took weekend trip to Lake George, NY with 3 adults and 2 kids without a problem.  Third row turned into a play area for kids and a extended bed for my 4 year old.  I am 6'4 and and have plenty of leg/head room.  Bought car for my wife.  Like Subaru so much the following week a bought a Legacy GT Turbo wagon.  Love both cars.  "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,CBrunner, 06/21/2005,B-9 is Beautiful!,4,"Wow, I have waited 2 and a half years for this car and all I can say is WOW!  I love the way the B-9 drives; it is hard to believe that you are that high off the ground!  All I can say is drive one and you will own one; perfect size, love the extra two seats and the rear heat and air is great for guests.  It isn't the most powerful 'ute out there but it sure does great with what it's got.  I love the engine sound and the exhaust note, it just screams sporty!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Ronald L. Jordan, 06/19/2005,Owner,5,We have owned this vehicle for two weeks and have found the experience very delightful.  We took one long trip in it thus far and found the car to perform beautifully and the ride was most comfortable.  There is plenty of leg room both front and rear and the quietness of the ride was the best we ever experienced.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Janet, 06/22/2005,B9 Tribeca,4,This is the sixth Subaru that I've owned.  I was very interested in buying an SUV and the timing of this vehicle was perfect.  It is beautiful inside and out and drives and handles like a car.  I am very pleased.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Ronzzo, 06/30/2005,Concept SUV in Production,5,"I first saw the Tribeca in March at a special invitation by Subaru. The styling of the vehicle, especially the interior had me sold, but I wanted to wait until I was able to test drive it. I finally did drive it and purchased it two weeks ago.I absolutely love driving it. The ride is quiet and it handles very well in turns. The instrumentation controls are at close reach and the brightly lighted gauges are easy to view. The five passenger vehicle is roomy and the adjustable rear seat supplies plenty of leg room."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,PapaHawk, 06/30/2005,Ode to an AWD Alfa Romeo....,5,"Capable, confident, and charismatic! The  Subaru B9 Tribeca is the complete 7-passenger AWD package.  With its Italian styling, Japanese engineering, and 100% Subaru core, this vehicle is destined to enjoy a long ride along the American road, and one of these beauties will always be parked in my garage! This is an amazing vehicle.  It is a pleasure to own and a joy to drive.  It has my unqualified support as the best automotive value in the SUV world."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Robert Brody, 07/02/2005,SUV With Personality!,4,"Complements from everyone on the looks of this car! The B9 is a great looking SUV to my eyes. Its both modern and retro all at once. It's far better looking than the still unattractive WRX or clunky Forester; cars that my eye never really adapted to. Good power and handling. Awesome interior and comfort.  Nothing but silky smoothness. I read one owner complaining about gear hunting, but my car exhibits none of that. Switching to manual mode is done on the fly and shifts are both smooth and useful. This is nicer than any SUV under 40K. There are some compromises, but the B9 has most of it right. I'm very impressed thus far."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Subienewbie, 07/03/2005,Best Of The Bunch,4,"This is my first Subaru. I did my homework before making up my mind and choosing the Tribeca.  My decision to buy a Tribeca may not seem surprising until you realize that the last 4 cars I have owned were a 1999 Jaguar XK8, a 2000 BMW 540si, a 2001 BMW M5 and a 2002 Infiniti Q45.  I mention this so you understand that I know what quality automobiles are.  I am not saying that a Tribeca is the equal of those cars but in comparing it to the likes of BMW X5, Lexus 330, Volvo, MDX etc, there are none that come close to the Tribeca and all cost thousands of dollars more."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,J CHAMBERS, 07/03/2005,CANT BEAT THE VALUE,4,"I traded in a 2004 VW Touareg with v6 engine which gave me more problems than I car to report. Electrical, transmission and no power. I purchased a B9 Tribeca a few days ago and comparing the two vehicles, the Subaru in my opinion the Subaru is a better value dollar to dollar on both base models."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,MikeJL, 07/05/2005,This is an awesome car,5,"This car is a knockout!  It is a winner in every category - interior comfort, available options, exterior styling, performance and fun factor.  I still can't believe it's a Subaru.  I've just returned from an 1800-mile vacation jaunt and I am more impressed than ever with the car.  It is very comfortable during long days on the road and has plenty of power to handle any driving situation with ease.  The DVD and NAV options really enhanced the enjoyment of the trip.  The car competes very well with the 'luxury' brands in its size class but at a substantially lower price.  Anyone looking for a car in this class should definitely take a close look at the Tribeca."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,bodpa, 07/12/2005,Fun to drive,5,I have had it for about a week and already have about 1100 miles. The handling is amazing and interior is wonderful. We use the full seven passengers (kids in the back) and is very comfortable.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Trace & Mike Francis, 07/14/2005,Very Classy Car,4,"My husband and I were originally looking to purchase the Murano, and as I was conducting research, I came across the Tribeca.  After going to the dealer and seeing it in person, we had to have it.  We absolutely love this car. We have the Atlantic Blue with grey interior. It's like a cross between the BMW X3, Infiniti, the Lexus and the Murano.  A lot of features to have fun with including the rear DVD, and it drives like a dream.  We haven't had the chance to test out the sports/manual transmission drive yet, but maybe when we go on vacation, we'll be able to test it.  Several people have already stopped to ask us what the car is, and we have gotten many curious looks when driving this car."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Len Barta, 07/15/2005,the Tribeca crossover,5,"After owning the Tribeca for about three weeks, I must say we are very pleased with the car. We find the vehicle has an ample amount of leg room  both front and back. We like the fact that the rear seats have fore and aft movement. The car handles beautifully. So far its been a pleasure to own."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,lisa, 07/16/2005,Finally found the SUV of my dreams,4,"I love it!  I tested all the others and found this to be the most stylish, comfortable, fun SUV there is out there. I have the back up system that beeps if you get to close and a premuim sound package.  It all just adds to my total enjoyment.  I,m short and have no problems seeing out windows.  Love that the backseat headrests are not in my view.  I also got a great deal so Im happy."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Claire, 07/29/2005,Love My New Subaru,5,I've had my new B9 Tribeca just over a month now and I love it.  It's stylish and eye catching.  I've had several people comment and ask about it.  It has great speed pick up and does an awesome job in the mountains.  I chose the Mahogany color with Beige interior and it looks great.  This is the nicest driving vehicle I've ever had and I highly recommend that anyone test drive it.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,JOHN, 07/29/2005,Great Car--Major Collision-Were Alive,4,A great car for the money.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,GYRFALCON, 07/30/2005,I LOVE this thing!,4,"Once I went out on a test drive, I was doomed!  This car floats over the road, and is as quiet as an electric vehicle, yet still has plenty of muscle and handles beautifully.  The reviewer who said it drives like ""a big, heavy truck"" had to be following one with his windows open and OD'ing on the fumes.  The nose does take some getting used to, but the interior and other angles of the exterior are design marvels.  So - if you love the feel of being pulled laboriously down the road by a noisy, vibrating engine placed at your knee level, and really enjoy the look of fake burled wood all around, then by all means stay away.  Otherwise, you may just get 'Beca'd."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Ken, 08/03/2005,Better than the BMW or Lexus,4,"I previously owned a Subaru, and wanted to again buy such a reliable automobile.  I test drove Lexus, BMW, Mercedes and a number of other SUV's.  Then I read about, and immediately test drove and purchased the new Subaru Tribeca.  For the money, the luxury and quality of this vehicle can not be beat.  My average mileage is about 21; less than expected but okay.  The comfort and style of the vehicle is first rate.  Now that I have the navigation system, I can not imagine being without one (it is like a cell phone, it becomes a necessity). The interior is extremely attractive and roomy, also great headroom for a tall guy. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Mary J, 08/08/2005,Best Yet!,4,"The Tribeca is the fourth Subaru I have owned and it is truly the ""best yet""! At 15 years and 250,000 miles, I gave my 1990 Legacy to my mother-in-law and prepared to buy an Outback wagon--until I saw the ""coming soon"" promotion on the Subaru website.  I am not sorry that I waited 4 months for the Tribeca. The styling outside and in is very sleek and eye-catching. The controls for AC/stereo are very convenient. The Tribeca handles very well and is as fun to drive as my Legacy.  I have taken several trips to mountainous areas.  The Tribeca holds the road in the curves extremely well and I have plenty of power climbing. It handled wet roads perfectly. Comfort, style, performance -- best yet!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Larry Schultz, 08/23/2005,Disappointment,3,"In mountains you cannot use cruise per manual and experience. Foot drive results in shifting under load between 3 & 4 gears. Have to rev engine to 5000+ rpm to maintain freeway speed. Engine screams and high rpm bad for engine. Won't pull hills in 4th. Sport shift helps but is not responsive enough and will shift gears without driver knowing.  Any call for power even on level road results in high rpm in 3rd with engine howling. Didn't pay all this money for automatic & cruise and not be able to use it. In general, lack of power causes behavior like my pickup towing a heavy camper. Driver seating is designed for small people. It's either stretch arms for wheel or knees ""against chest"" for 6 footer."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,shawn t, 08/21/2005,Love it,4,"After having our 2005 Outback stolen we bought the Tribeca and have been very happy with it.  After owning a Lexus RX 300, I find this car as comfortable and even more fun to drive.  It has taken a bit to get used to the outside look, but I am very happy with the inside.  I am very happy with this car and would recommend it to anyone."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,ChicagoSteve, 09/04/2005,Awesome! But Missing a Few Touches,4,"This is an incredible car. I am in the advertising business for auto dealerships and had my pick of cars. I looked at several but for the money for the B9 nothing comes close. I have the NAV system and the information this car provides is just scary, above and beyond the the actual Nav system. Every car detail from current MPG to service intervals and a calculator are only a touch away. As for what the car is missing, one thing would have to be seat memory. My wife and friends have tried my car and it takes me forever to get it back. Also a coin holder. These thing sound minor and they are, but every model above $30k has them."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Lanie, 09/06/2005,Tribeca's great! (exc. gas mileage!),3,"I love my new Tribeca. I also own an '03 Honda Pilot. Both had the NAV system, the 'becca has the DVD too. The Tribeca is much more posh inside, but I think its NAV is worst than the Pilot. The driver shouldn't have to figure out which ""zone"" she is looking up an address in, and living in Pa/NJ, I have to switch between zones! The Honda NAV is much nicer, easier to work, and thus quicker. Subaru should send out discs that cover all the USA! This zone stuff is from years ago. Another downfall on the Subaru is the lack of the radio station and time being featured alongside the map. Press map, then feature, then back to map. Not cool. And the gas mileage, well, I'm doing 18mpg at best on the highway."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Johnny Kay, 09/09/2005,Works for Me,4,"I owned a Baja for the last two years but the innovative design just didn't meet my needs for family/pets.  The B9 allowed me to stay with Subaru and get the cargo space that I needed.  I find the B9 much more fun to drive than my Jeep Grand Cherokee -- better handling, better road grip, and feels more like a car than a truck.  Easy access all the way around including in/out of the driver's seat (bad back). The gold is gorgeous, and I don't mind the front styling though I can see that it won't please everybody.  As with the Baja, the B9 gets a lot of eye interest from others on the road.  Could use a little more oomph at times, and I'd like a slightly larger fuel tank. Good mpg. Drive one."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,MR. POTTS, 09/19/2005,TRULY A MONSTER,5,"Simply a well built machine.  From its initial design, structural stability, solid stance, and car-like maneuverability ... this machine is a monster.  My only peeve is that the premium sound system needs a real wake up call.  My 2005 Outback premium sound blows the B9 sound package out of the water.  Otherwise ... A+"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,marta, 09/18/2005,B9 bmine,4,"I'm tickled by the reaction my B9 receives when I drive by.  It truly is unusual without being ""weird"".  It is a luxury ride and makes me smile each time I look at it or drive it."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,mw1, 10/07/2005,Subaru B9 Tribeca Ltd. 5 pass. Gold/Beige,5,"This is my third Subaru. '98 Legacy Outback, '03 Forester XS. Added features: crossbar aero, luggage compartment cover, auto-dimming mirror/compass, cargo net rear & back seat, all weather floor mats, rear bumper cover, cargo tray, & puddle lights.  The Tribeca so far is the BEST. Very comfortable and lots of room for back seat passengers. The V6 engine gives good power for highway acceleration. The control panel is easy to reach. Rides like a car and takes bumps pretty good. Did have a problem with the steering wheel clicking. Brought it in for service and they repaired a loose steering knuckle bolt. Had in back within 1 hour. I'm hoping the B9 will be as reliable as my other Subaru's. I LOVE IT."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Tad Bratten, 10/16/2005,Great Vehicle No Compromises,4,"We finally purchased the Tribeca a week ago and took it on about a 700 mile road trip through freeway (fast and nearly stopped heavy traffic), city (LA), desert and mountains and the vehicle performed superbly. Great looking and still rare here in So. California so the vehicle got lots of looks. The seats are great and we are coming from a Volvo. Interior is top quality and the dash and switchgear are perfect.  Nav is brilliant. The car drives like a smaller vehicle than it is and responds very well to inputs for acceleration, turning and braking -- everything feels tight and capable.  Quiet. You feel safe up a bit higher but will out handle any SUV out there. Avg 21 mpg so far -- just fine."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,jmw14, 10/18/2005,A True Winner,4,"An amazing vehicle for the price.  Refined, and crisp styling that turns the eyes.  The ride is amazingly smooth and quiet.  Subaru's best family vehicle in its line-up."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,dtielbur, 10/18/2005,Quality SUV,4,"What an awesome driving experience!  Subaru has put everything they could think of in this vehicle.  This SUV packs quality with comfort at an affordable price compared to other luxury SUV's. The dashboard wraps around the front seat passengers and puts all controls at their fingertips.  Dual climate controls makes sure that men and women can coexist in the same car, controlling their own temp. Highly recommend the DVD player if you have children.  The wireless headphones are a nice touch, making sure that the driver can still listen to their own music while backseat passengers are satisfied watching DVD. The 3rd row seat is not intended for long trips or adults and eliminates storage."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Stephanie Allen, 11/03/2005,My 2006 Tribeca,5,After a month of ownership I have found the Tribeca's performance to be excellent.  Its ride comfort is excellent with outside road noise at an acceptable level.  The acceleration both from a start up condition as well as passing is better than average.  Steering response is excellent and breaking is very smooth with minimum fade.  Head room and leg room are is generous. MPG is as advertised. The ride is acceptionally smooth and subtle.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Jinnie, 11/10/2005,Fun car to drive!,4,"After owning for Ford Explorers I changed to the Subaru. What a fun experience. Sure there are minor changes I would like to see but if the position of a knob is my only complaint, look out American car makers! One problem ... the way people stare at your car! Worth a test drive."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,B9chef, 11/11/2005,"Great car, but ...",4,"I was deciding between the Subaru and the Murano  The Murano had *extremely* comfortable seats, but it just didn't have the reputation and trust of Subaru.  The Subaru was a little cheaper than the Murano.  So far, it has been wonderful.  It is very stable on the road, and at fast highway speeds, it handles great.  But mileage has been noticeably worse than the estimates.  Granted, I am driving less than 35 MPH in bumper to bumper traffic in Los Angeles, but I am still only getting 16 MPG ... though freeway speeds get me 22-24 MPG.  I'm bummed that the Nav is now offered in the Ltd 5-Pass. I wanted it in mine.  Overall, quality is good, but many improvements can be made."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,StellaLuna, 11/25/2005,Not The Car For Everyone,3,"So take this with a grain of salt ... I love the style, the ride is awesome, features above and beyond, easy handling, smooth ride. However there are blind spots and if you don't happen to be 5'8"" tall they can be dangerous. This is my opinion and I realize others will disagree. The Tribeca needs a few improvements like bigger mirrors, higher seat adjustment, and redesign that side back window; it can really hide a small car who is static in driving speed. Also mileage is poor at about 15.5 mpg using super gas ... big improvement needed here. So take this for what its worth and if you are 5'4"", take that second and third test drive to be sure you are comfortable."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Michelle A., 12/02/2005,Lovin'it!,4,"I love this car! I traded in an '03 Honda Pilot. I was hoping for better gas mileage, but since I live in the mountains, I was willing to forgo mpg for better dirt road handling in the snow. Tribeca does that very well. I am 6'1"" and have never fit in a Subaru comfortably. The Tribeca is amazingly comfortable, quiet, fun to drive and even fits my 6'1"" and over sons very comfortably in the back seat."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,loki707, 12/02/2005,Tribeca Rocks!,4,So far the Tribeca is more and more fun to drive every day.  I test drove all the rest and the Tribeca I knew wouldn't get boring.  It's not too big and not too small.  It's the easiest to park of all the 7+ seaters.  Enjoy one for yourself.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,B9CT, 12/07/2005,Could be better,3,"I picked up my B9 yesterday and found things that I didn't during test drive. Woefully lacking in the pick up department. Almost seems the car is too big for the engine. SOA should address with factory authorized aftermarket performance upgrades. Loved the look and feel of the interior, dials and gauges well laid out, informative and good non-intrusive coloring (Blue/Orange). Front, middle and cargo areas have great amounts of room. All in all an ok vehicle."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,narotam, 12/06/2005,SUV Subaru at last,4,"Excellent driving experience in snow and tarmac.  Good power, excellent AWD and traction control. Windshield wipers obscure view of nose and headlights."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Anthony, 12/07/2005,B9 BINGO!,4,"This vehicle is awesome! I feel like I'm driving a $55,000 vehicle for close to $20,000 less."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Gary Gleason, 01/12/2006,Good value and performance,4,"First SUV (if you can call it that) I have owned; love the NAV system.  The salesman showed us the dealership owner's demo first that did not have the NAV system.  What a mistake, we almost didn't buy one but went back and took a Limited for a test drive. So far combined mileage about 60% in town and 40% at 70+ mph is 19.8 and at 65 mph the NAV system says we are getting 24 miles per gallon, which is not bad for this size of car."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,timedpolaris, 01/29/2006,I love this Subaru!,4,This car is awesome. It handles winter roads unbelievably well. Power is great. Interior is awesome. Seems complicated at first but has many many useful features. Very nice car.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Stan, 01/30/2006,Was looking for a Subaru,4,"I was looking for a Subaru because of the reliability, AWD, and performance. I saw the Tribeca in the showroom. I have seen one or two on the road before, but did not fancy the front so it did not come to mind when I was shopping for a car. I did not like the Impreza WRX, because it was a little too small, so I asked the dealer if I could test drive the Tribeca. Once I sat in the car, I fell in love. The console design is amazing. It drives and handles like an expensive luxury car. I was impressed by the safety reviews and the standard list of options that came with this car. So I ended up buying it and it's truly a remarkable vehicle."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,calibuyer, 02/01/2006,Some reasons NOT to buy this car.,2,"After test-driving this car twice and much research,  we bought this vehicle off the showroom floor in DEC of '05. After our first weekend it was in the shop after a problem with all the warning light signals. The service dept asked why we had not made an appointment! The problem was not fixed and had to be taken to the dealer 3 more times. It was then we were told our TRIBECA had a FAULTY TRANSMISSION. It stayed in the shop for over 2 weeks plus the previous days in the shop. The TRIBECA has been in the shop now more days then we have been able to drive it. This is the worst NEW car experience we have ever had. Subaru please fix this. We can't recommend buying this car."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,nightspun, 02/09/2006,My favorite car I've ever driven,4,"We were the first people in our state to own a Tribeca. This is the 2nd Subaru we have owned, and are duly impressed with both models (the other was a Forester - owned for just under six years). My husband and I wanted to switch to a slightly larger vehicle to accommodate our needs as we now have a son. The Tribeca met or exceeded all of our expectations on every item other than the gas mileage and some visibility issues while driving. Generally it seems we don't get over 18 per gallon and much of the time it is less. As we don't drive the car as much as some people, it affects our petrol bills less."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,vermonter, 02/16/2006,Nice vehicle,4,"I like the styling.  The fit and finish are fantastic and the interior lights are quite soothing.  Small gas tank and overall MPG of 16 is a modest drawback.  Rear seat is small, good for little children and little else.  Very easy to adjust rear seats.  I got a back up warning signal as option.  Needed given rear design."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Byron Cancelmo, 02/20/2006,Best car on the road,4,"I own a 2005 VW Touareg as well. Each vehicle has its own appeal. Comparing the two vehicles is like comparing Lexus to Mercedes. Lexus being the Subaru. Basically for the money you get everything you need and more. Each vehicle has its own technological features that sets each other apart. Bottom line, I am absolutely thrilled with my new Tribeca. Not only is it one of the nicest cars on the road, there is a sense of independence one feels when driving it around. They are not everywhere. I like it that way, it's my little secret."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,lisa, 02/19/2006,Not so in love anymore,2,I have had my Tribeca for 7 months and the bloom is off the rose.  I have to open the drivers door and put the seat back so I can reach the gas opener which is hid underneath the seat.  This is a problem because I am at the gas station twice a week!  The bells ring for the seat belt if you put a gallon of milk on the seat.  The drive is becoming stiffer (didn't know that was possible).  Had a piece of the dashboard fall off and I dare anyone to find the hood open latch without the manual!  I had much better luck with an Outback.  Good news is it's a lease so the end is in sight.  Just doesn't have the Subaru reliability you look for.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Alex , 02/22/2006,Excellent car so far,4,First Subaru in my household and whole family loves it. No bad things so far.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,P. Clarke, 03/05/2006,My Tribeca -- a good choice!,5,Love it!  Whether zipping around town or settling down for a road trip it is fun to drive.  It has great response to the gas pedal and the steering wheel.  Have been on a trip from Cincinnati to Lawton OK and another to Savannah GA and enjoyed the Tribeca on the road as much as in the city.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,asraghu, 03/16/2006,The most unknown SUV & is the Best,4,"Driving experience is top class, the handling is so different from Murano & RAV4 that I almost decided not to take a serious look at this unknown candidate in my list. I saw a great value in the AWD system after reviewing all available documentation around on Subaru's AWD vs, Audi's AWD,; finally I decided that this is a very special SUV under the hood. The interiors were better than Murano and to some extent RX330. There are few problems with this SUV like the power lock switch does not light up, parking brake has issues etc. but just ignore all these for what you get under the hood & the handling. Once the engine warms up it's almost silent there after. Acceleration is moderate/average."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,douglasdubois, 03/17/2006,Buy It - Lease It - GET IT TODAY,4,"I got my Tribeca Saturday. Monday drove it to FL, phenomenal, my 4th Subaru, somewhat biased? Maybe, but have Audi's as well. I leased no money down, taxes rolled in etc. and pay $498.00. Now this does include some excess from my previous VDC which I owned but still owed on! I have the 15,000 miles allowance and a $20,995 buyout. I cannot recommend this car enough. I also test drove everything comparable; the only other serious contenders for me: the hybrid twins from Toyota; the Lexus was too much and the Highlander just not visually exciting. On I-95, it tracked true, it's quick enough and 21 mpg! Nav and MP3 are standouts; how did i live without these before? NO disappointments here - recommended."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Shopper, 03/17/2006,WAY TO GO SUBARU,5,"Safety, comfort, reliability and it looks good too! It moves out performance wise.  The nav system is a very helpful feature and sometimes funny with its voice out of nowhere and bing bings.  Backing up takes practice due to narrow limited vision in rear. No vehicle is perfect but this one comes close for me."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,bob barich, 03/20/2006,Best car Ever,5,My wife and I are journalists and work from home offices. She suggested looking at the Tribeca in the hope it would get me out of the house more often. Previously we averaged 5500 miles per year; now 9000. I guess it worked! We have owned everything from a Dino to a Q45; nothing garners more attention than the B9; which is especially amazing in a car-jaded town like West Los Angeles. Handling and breaking is on a par with a sports sedan and fit and finish is first rate--more than several rungs above its price point. Absolutely wonderful! 
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,apkjczb, 03/22/2006,beautiful car,4,"I bought this car because I needed a car that has 7 passenger seating but I hate those big trucks with 7 seats, so this was the perfect match for me, I loved the interior design, and the leg room it has since I am a tall guy (6.2) the few things I am missing in the car is the Bluetooth, and rear backup sensor which is important for this car since it has a tiny rear window so its a large blind spot."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Mario, 04/13/2006,Very happy,4,I come from a German brand and I am very impressed with this car. It looks very nice and runs very nice also. Very good finishing and comfortable interior.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Ali, 04/13/2006,Love the Tribeca,4,I have had my Tribeca for almost a month and LOVE the car.  I traded out of a Lexus RX330 and have not compromised at all. I have every available option you would need and the car drives like a dream.  It is heavier than the Lexus but that is due to AWD that is standard on Subarus.  I would definitely recommend this car!
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,West, 05/02/2006,Can't say enough good!,4,"This vehicle has exceeded all of my expectations.  I feel like a walking Subaru commercial as people stop me in parking lots and ask about the car.  It rides smoothly, handles well and has an opulent interior.  "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,SK, 05/02/2006,More car for your buck,5,"I have been a B9 owner for 4 months now and I must say, the more I drive it, the more I love it. I have happened to drive it in a blizzard, therefore, I can say the AWD system is the best I have seen (the second best is Audi). Extremely smooth braking, and you don't feel thrown forward when sudden braking is necessary. Adequate performance, however, more torque for quicker acceleration would be nicer. The interior design is gorgeous, and I catch gas attendants checking it out and giving compliments all the time."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,rwambold, 05/25/2006,Love it!,4,"I'm a picky car guy, and I love this car. I became die-hard loyal to Subaru when I owned an Outback wagon for 4 years. I traded it in hesitantly but boy am I glad I did. The Tribeca is the perfect mean between an obnoxiously large SUV and too-small station wagon. The controls are well thought-out, the engine performs smoothly and beautifully whether you are gunning it in sport or manual mode or just cruising around town, and the interior is perfectly roomy (do bear in mind this is compared to the comparatively small Outback wagon). I read some static about the exterior design when the car first came out, but I love the styling too."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,taris128, 05/26/2006,Great Features and Value!,4,"My wife is a loyal Subaru customer, this B9 is her 3rd Subaru. The interior of this vehicle is superb.  The standard features like power moonroof, AWD, curtain airbags, fog lights make it a great value.   We really like the B9 styling, the exterior is very unique. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,dwnayl, 09/11/2006,2006 B9 Tribeca,4,"I searched for mid-size SUV's for two months.  I drove the Murano, Highlander, and fell in love with the Tribeca.  I got the 7 passenger Limited with the leather seats, gps navigation, and sun roof.  The interior is beautiful although I am worried that the chrome fittings will scratch.  Drives very smooth and very quiet.  I get around 21 mpg in town and 25 on the highway.  I have had a lot of positive comments on the Tribeca.  I love that the 2nd row of seats can be adjusted. I am 6'4"" and I can fit in the back seat.  I couldn't be happier with my decision. Plan on getting rear cargo mat and bumper cover.  Definitely recommend the Tribeca."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Tommy K, 09/28/2006,Great in Snow. Fun to Drive,4,"I bought mine in January and had 2 snow storms to deal with.  It handled the snow better than my previous Mercedes ML350 did or my current Hummer H3.  Great handling, safety ratings, comfortable for all.  Tiptronic steering lets you accelerate very quickly when needed.  "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,New Subie Lover, 10/09/2006,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,5,"Excellent vehicle. Never had a Subaru before, will always consider one now. Fit and finish are excellent, very tight turning radius, AWD is awesome in rain, can really feel a difference. Navigation is a pleasure to use. Only drawback is when on the highway and ascending up a hill, the transmission can't make up its mind where it wants to be, but is easily remedied with a downshift on the sportshifter...take this for a ride before you buy a Murano, you won't be disappointed. Hope this helps you."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Frank, 01/19/2007,Great comfortable ride.,5,"Had this for a couple of months now.  Been up the mountain a couple of times, in three big snow storms and still on the icy roads every day.  It all handle very well.  Gas mileage in the city is not that great, but you can't complain about a 25mpg average from a ski trip, can you?  For more power, you definitely need to know the clutchless gear shift option.  It's easy and fun too.  What more can I say?"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Roy McGrew, 01/19/2007,Nothing but a great ride,4,"Our Tribeca just turned over 12,000 happy miles.  It's truly a great car.  Over the last 2,000 miles we have averaged 20.4 mpg.  The state-of-the-art aluminum boxer engine is powerful and very smooth.  It makes good horsepower, but being only 3.0 L, the torque is rather low for hauling a 4100-lb auto.  This means it downshifts quite a bit under load.  But hey, if you are on a road where it hunts, or you don't like where it shifts, you can hush up and shift it yourself.  The ""Sport shift mode"" works great.  Ride, handling, and braking are very good.  We have the two-seat model and there is loads of room in the second seat.  Styling is also a plus - it doesn't have the truck look."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Jerri, 01/22/2007,Love my Tribeca!,4,"I love this car, recently put the AWD to test. The car handled very nice on the slick snow covered roads. I felt very secure and safe driving it. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,chemgirl9, 02/21/2007,great vehicle! Subaru heritage SUV style,4,"Bought it to drive from TX to NH with a 100lb dog and a cat - no problems, all were comfortable.  Use the DVD all the time for 2 hour trips to see relatives nearby.  We were the first ones in to the dealer with 30K checkup - we drive a LOT!  Handles NH snow/ice excellently and always feels solid.  Easily carries 5 adults, 7 for short trips (the rear seat is small, but okay).  Quiet interior (as good or better than others I drove, including VW, Lexus, BMW, etc.) and good Subaru value (put $ where it counts, not on wood paneling!).  Everything is still solid and we are @~40K.  Tires are still doing well.    Puddle lights are great - I had no idea how useful they would be!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Barnes, 02/27/2007,Wonderful Crossover,4,"I love it.  Takes curves with very little lean.  The unit is extremely quiet. Subaru compares the Tribeca to the Lexus and Infiniti SUV but stopped short of including XM radio, Bluetooth, and Memory Seats.  But the ride and handling of this vehicle make up for the missing items.  I would buy it again."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,sbddmd1, 03/14/2007,Not Bad,4,"Very nice wagon, 250hp. I put a K&G air filter on it, which made it get up and go a little faster.  Very spacious interior, my wife like driving the B9 more than her own SUV."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Eric, 07/15/2007,Not what I expected from a Subaru,3,"30,000 miles replaced struts, sway bar bushing, head pipe cracked and replaced both headlights. The interior has developed rattles all over the place. Just sold it and driving my 14 year old E320 benz until I find something else. Maybe I'm expecting too much.  "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Jeff Moss, 10/11/2007,Awesome ride,4,"This is truly a fabulous vehicle.  I am a true Subaru customer over the years I have owned a Subaru Brat, Legacy, and now the B9 Tribeca and it truly performs. Not only is it fun to drive, it is well made and very reliable. I would recommend and purchase another but I simply do not want to part with mine.  "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,RMB, 05/30/2007,B9 Review,4,"Car drives really well.  The AWD is really stable and the car handles excellent for an SUV.  Car is comfortable, but still communicates a lot of info to the driver.  Navigation is very well implemented and the stereo is top quality."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Tribeca B9, 08/21/2007,2006 Subaru B9 Tribeca Ltd.,4,"With only 6,000 miles on my 2006, I just had to take the car in for a complete/total re-paint! Looked almost like someone had thrown acid ALL over it. I have the champagne pearl opal. Thankfully after 2 months of negotiation, SofA has agreed to pay for a California re-paint. But as I planned to keep this car like I had my old MBZ wagon (200,000+ miles), I fear for the integrity and longevity of a re-paint. Otherwise, have liked it very much. Seems very powerful though a bit too thirsty after the diesel benz!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Sergei, 06/17/2007,Great car,4,"I have 12 months, 12K miles with my B9. Great car. This winter in Colorado was bad and I enjoyed driving. The car did very well on the snow and ice roads with manual shifting. I made a trip to Seattle (almost 3K miles, avg. speed about 75-80) plus there is my every day commute from home to work in Denver.  The average mileage is 21 per gallon.  "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Vancouver, WA,Great Value -- Subaru!!,4,"The car drives very smooth and quiet. Great car for the money that looks good in and out, safe and fun to drive, and good on gas. Good handling and AWD is great in slippery/snowy roads. I drive about 40% city and 60% highway so I get very good gas mileage (average is 20-21) and on all of my highway trips I got 23-24 mpg. So the EPA is accurate for the highway for me. But again I drive very smoothly and try not to drive hard for no reason. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Daycay, 11/09/2007,I love my B-9,4,"I had a 2005 Subaru Outback L.L. Bean Edition. I loved the car but my son had a growth spurt and we kind of outgrew it. I approached the dealer and asked to trade for a B-9 because I love Subaru's and was happy with everything about the ownership experience. I am totally pleased with my B-9. At first,  I thought it a little sluggish upon accelleration but a K&N permanent air filter cleared up that problem. I have the highest degree of happiness about my B-9 and the overall attitude Subaru has toward it's car owners!  "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Steve, 05/05/2008,An opinion,3,"I have enjoyed driving this vehicle. Tight construction, firm seats, sport shift is fun to use. To date I've averaged 18.9 miles p/gal overall driving. We had a recent 300 +/- mile highway trip and we got 22.9 mpg. I would prefer better mileage, especially today, but the vehicle has meet my expectations and I'm very pleased with it. This is my first SUV and it is truly easy in, easy out. I had my first winter with this car and it was fantastic in the snow. I would buy another one. "

I loved the handling and pep of the 3.0 boxer motor!! The transmission would take a second but was pretty much there when you needed it. My brother in law and wife/3year old daughter and mother in law got into a high speed accident (around 75mph). The control the AWD gave them, with the awesome balance of the car ... SAVED THEIR LIVES!!! I know if it wasn't for this car they probably wouldn't have made it!!! The safety in this car was lifesaving!!! I am now looking for a new one. I AM A BELIEVER...

subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Wendy, 02/24/2018,Tribeca Love,5,"I love my Tribeca and have been pretty happy with it overall.  My biggest issues have been with headlights not being bright enough and an ongoing problem with a computer glitch.  Car will be running fine, but the instrumentation just freaks out every so often and we have had to reset everything by disconnecting the battery (per my former Subaru mechanic's instruction) to make it go away.  Thinking it may be a sensor problem, but just have not had money to replace and find out.  My car is 12 years old now and has had few real major issues until the last 2 years, which had us replace a few original parts - something we expected.  This is my fourth Subie, but it will be my last as I am moving away from any nearby Subaru mechanics and will need to find a car that I can have serviced easier as I age more.
"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2006,Bianca, 02/27/2018,Great...for a while.,3,"Bought this car used in 2013 with about 78k. This was the first car I bought on my own! Previously had a 1998 Chevy cavalier (my first car I got in high school)! The subaru was a 7 passenger, limited, grey interior, with navigation. I LOVED this car when I first bought it. It was comfy, roomy, and had everything I needed and more! In 2015 my check engine light came on, the car would shake horribly, and completely struggled to accelerate...uh oh! But, problems are to be expected in a 9 year old car! Took it to a local shop to see what the problem was. Store owner claimed to love this vehicle and knows all about them...yeah...! Told me it was the battery connection and changed the battery for me. Great! Check engine light turned off, shaking stopped, accelerating went back to normal.  I’m good to go, or so I thought. Nope! I live in Nebraska and the weather can change at the drop of a hat. Began raining one day, about two weeks later, and all the problems came back. Took it back to the shop twice before they decided to shut down their store without notice and without actually fixing the problem. Cool, what a waste of $500. Whatever, problem came and went as the weather changed for over a year. Weird, but apparently this vehicle is notorious for that, according to other reviews and subaru forums. Fast forward to 2017. The problem continued to come and go, but now the car was over heating and air conditioning wasn’t working (in the awesome heat of the summer - had upper 90’s this summer). Yay! Took it to multiple Subaru mechanics and NO ONE I mean NO ONE could figure out the problems. Kept driving, probably dumb, but oh well. Finally the power steering went out...while I was getting onto the highway. Let it sit for two weeks or more while I looked at buying a car. Well, as I was taking it in to be traded in it literally shut off, like the entire thing. Wouldn’t drive, lights turned off, compass on rear view mirror had all the lines flashing with it making no actual letter, wouldn’t accelerate, and lord knows what else was happening (I was in panic mode because I was on a main road). Finally had it towed to a local Subaru specialty shop and a NON-Subaru mechanic figured it out! Turns out the previous shaking was caused by a bad spark plug, like the wiring inside. The rest of the problems were caused by the serpentine belt going out (just under $300 for parts and labor). Car was back up and running, until about a month later when the check engine light came on again. Took it to autozone to check the code...it was the 3rd spark plug again which was causing me to drive on five cylinders instead of six. Light never turned off (since about November 2017), then started over heating again and the inside of the car was not warming up...aka, my windows wouldn’t defrost...in the middle of winter, cool, literally! Anyways, decided to go with a Honda CR-V this time around due to the massive headaches this thing was causing me. I turned in the keys with about 151k. Overall, it’s a good car, but left me with massive headaches when no one could figure out how to fix the problems. Last note, the car does not get 18/23 mpg. It’s more like 12/15. I was averaging 13 mpg since I drive highway (which bottlenecks during rush hour) and city. Will I buy a Subaru in the future, I don’t know. If I do, it’ll be a legacy or Forester or a more “popular” car because parts are VERY LIMITED in the States for this vehicle. Hope this was helpful for someone looking into this vehicle!

subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Krista, 09/10/2006,I love this car!,4,"I've had my new '07 Tribeca for a month now, and I absolutely love it. I shopped the Nissan Murano, and Lexus RX330, but ultimately had to go with the Tribeca. It's got a 3rd row (which fits adults comfortably, despite some reviews I read), which neither Nissan nor Lexus even offer. Plus I could get leather, dvd back-up camera and nav for thousands less than the Murano or RX330. This car is fun to drive, it has plenty of power. The only downside is the gas mileage has been awful, I'm averaging 16 mpg, with a mix of highway and around town (with air on, it's been hot!). Plus the tank only holds 16 gallons, so fill-ups are frequent. Overall, this car looks and feels very luxurious."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,wxman475, 12/11/2006,B9 Tribeca w/ Nav,5,"It's certainly the one of a kind SUV - powerful, solid, luxury & fun to drive.  Looking for a premium quality SUV for some time, I was initially interested in ACURA RDX and test drove that many times. RDX, besides pricey, turned out to be too small compared to Tribeca, especially the tight back seat and small cargo area; it's also way too noisy when speeding up from low speed. Tribeca, on the other hand, feels more solid when turning & smoother speeding up. Some people complained about the gas mileage. I'm getting 21.5 to 23.9 mi/gal combined local and highway in the DC area. For an SUV this size with AWD, I'm happy. Sport shift is certainly helpful to gain speedy pass when needed-easy to use."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Justin, 08/17/2015,Bought with 179000 miles!,4,"We bought this with high miles. Yes it needed some maintenance. As do all high mileage cars. Fixed a few things and it runs amazing. So quick and nimble in traffic yet you can go anywhere with the Subaru AWD system. 3rd row is perfect for the tight situations and the interior is ahead of its time. Everything looks bland compared to this car.  Flat six runs for ever if you take care of it.

subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,SubiNewby, 10/24/2006,Great vehicle,5,"This was my first Subaru...got this vehicle for my wife because of the safety aspects, but we both love it. This is a luxury vehicle at an affordable price. I can't recommend it enough.  Good low end torque, with a little less response on the highway.  Corners without leaning, haven't had a chance to put the AWD to test.  Interior is top-notch and very comfortable, including for back seat passengers.  3rd row is a joke, which is why we purchased the 5 passenger version.  We chose this over X3, Murano, Highland, CR-V and CX-7. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,RWP, 09/06/2006,Test drove 17 SUVs and bought the B9,5,"This vehicle was purchased for my wife.  She wanted an SUV that wasn't too big, wasn't too small, wasn't the same as everyone else, and had lots of features. We test drove everything (17 in total) from $25K to over $70K.  We liked the Porsche Cayenne S, but didn't feel like spending that much.  We also liked the Lexus RX350, but everyone has one.  The Subaru B9 Tribeca was the last one we tested and we only tried it because the Porsche and Audi dealer also sold Subaru.  We liked it so much, and the dealer gave us a very good deal on a just off the truck 2007 model, that we bought it that day.  We have taken it on two long road trips and love it."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Maddog, 09/15/2009,Best car I have ever had,5,We got this car with 580000 miles on it.  We have had three other subies and loved them all.  Our son loves it and calls it the spaceship car (he is five years old ); we travel often and love this car.  We had a chevy uplander before and it was JUNK and not four wheel drive.  I highly recommend this car to anyone and know a lot of people that have them and love them.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Tup, 09/27/2006,Very nice plus unique,4,"We previously owned a Forester for 9 years and found it getting a little small for us, esp. in the rear seat.  So we got a great deal on a Tribeca and love it.  We won't use the 3rd row much but it's nice to have the option.  The rear seat is very roomy with the seat moved all the way back (some don't know there is a second lever for sliding back more).  The nav is very good once you figure it out (watch the video it comes with!).   Handles very well for its size and has enough power especially compared to the Forester.  It gets lots of looks and everyone says it looks much better first hand vs seeing pictures. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Dmitry, 07/15/2007,"A little slow, a little ugly, but safe",3,"I suppose I could talk about how slow the car feels, the so-so ride quality, the hard seats, and the subpar audio system (although it does read MP3 discs); but that's been said.  I'd like to talk about how this car saved my life.  While driving in the winter in Minnesota, doing about 55 mph, the road suddenly changed from plowed to about 9 inches of snow.  As the car begins to slide out of control, I give it full left but the steering is unresponsive, as are the brakes.  As I'm about to hit a parked car doing 55, I remember than in an AWD vehicle you must gently apply gas to recover.  Voila.  AWD saved me from what would have been a horrendous accident.  Slow?  Who cares."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Amin, 07/06/2008,Tribeca B9 is an excellent choice,4,"Before I bought this car I read lots of negative things about exterior design in on-line reviews. Honestly, I believe its high tech exterior looks much better than the 2008 model and is totally different from other SUVs. I love it. Interior is  amazing and built of excellent material. Driving is smooth as luxury sedan, compare to many other SUVs such as Murano that gives you the impression of driving a truck rather than a car. Car is stable and powerful. Like other SUVs, It is not good on gas. I enjoy driving it very much so far and everybody loves it. I couldnt find people who hate the design yet and I am still looking for!  "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,xspeedrj, 08/02/2006,Tribeca B9,4,"Best vehicle I have ever owned. Rides smooth and the interior never fails to impress. AWD is superior and the build quality is second to none. For the price the Lexus and Acura can't touch the B9.  So far two friends about to buy Pilots, even had deals together, bought B9s after test driving them at my suggestion. It certainly is worth a look for anyone in the luxury or near luxury SUV market."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,gldylox, 07/27/2012,NIGHTMARE of a Car,1,"I bought this car with 62K miles which is low for a subaru.
Let me preface this saying I have owned 2 subuaru's before.
I have owned this car less than a year and have the following issues...
The car loses power when driving randomly.
It stalls, lurches, and loses power.
It has been in the dealership for 7 weeks off and on to solve this problem.
Well at first they couldn't find anything wrong.
Four check engine lights later and 5 visits to the dealership, 2 oxygen sensors, 1 catalytic converter and an oil leak later the car is still not fixed.
This really has become a safety issue as the problem happens once the car has been driven over 100 miles. Won't buy a subaru again"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,TAS, 06/07/2008,A diamond in the rough,4,"Traded in a late model Nissan and bought a year-old Tribeca with 9,000 miles on it. This vehicle is a ""diamond in the rough"". An unbelievable value for what I got. The Limited trim line with the mesh grille and big chrome wheels really set this vehicle apart from the rest of the pack. Overall fit and finish is sexy and superb. Excellent handling and responsive boxer 6 cyl engine give a sense of confidence. This is the first Subaru I have owned, but have family members who've owned several Outbacks and a Legacy GT and I can see why they rave about this often over- looked brand! I wonder what Subaru's service dept is like -- hopefully better than Nissan's!"
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,rioria, 01/24/2008,"Spiderman, Spiderman",4,"I traded in my 2003 Legacy Outback Limited for the Tribeca as soon as it came off the production line.  It is so much fun to drive.  It is also my very first automatic!  I wasn't sure I would like an automatic, so I decided to lease it.  Well, here it is almost three years later, and I am still smitten.  I was so disappointed when they changed the front in the 2008 model.  That is what made it so unique.  And, that is why I will most likely purchase this at lease end.  I am going to check out the new Forester, and then make my final decision.  I am looking for a  car to own for the next 10 years.  Every time we have to climb a steep hill in the snow, we sing the Spiderman theme.  "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Mtnbiker, 01/09/2007,Great CUV!,5,"Good, safe vehicle for my wife.  Full time AWD, stability control, heated everything...good winter vehicle. Comes with all the bells and whistles for a very reasonable price, maybe because they aren't exactly flying off the lots.  The mileage isn't too miserable either (20ish).  Plus, we LIKE the look of the vehicle."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Virginia, 10/16/2007,Awesome,4,"This is my second Subaru. I had a Ltd Legacy, over 100000 on it and traded it for a fuel efficient Honda Civic. My daughter now owns that with its 109,000 miles and many more to go. The Tribeca is my first sport luxury car. I drove 5 cars that day and once I drove the Tribeca, that was it, I couldn't go back to the others. I never want to rush somewhere, I just want to be in the car and mosey along. Do I mind a stoplight? Not at all. Just turn up the awesome speaker system. I sat in the third row... no problem for me, I'm 5'5""."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Scott, 12/23/2009,Disappointed,3,"We purchased this car with 12,000 miles on it. It doesn't have as much power as other cars on the market, transmission shift terrible. Nav system isn't that great, poor graphics."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,JohnCA, 08/11/2010,Do not buy this car!,2,"Well, this is my experience: We bought our 2007 Tribeca new from the dealer in 2007 - since then? Well it consumes more than a quart of oil a month. Also, for the second time since we've owned it it needed the timing chain serviced (first was under warranty, thank God). This time I had done the oil change in May, in July it was down 4 quarts! Amazing, and this time there was no factory warranty to back it up. Do yourself a favor and get something else."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Joesubaru, 07/27/2006,This is a great small family vehicle,4,"We love this car. This is our 4th Subaru and the biggest they make; we have the WRX and the Baja, and this make a great safe and fun car."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Tom, 12/20/2006,Short on detail,3,"This is my first Subaru, and I bought it based on its safety ratings, the recommendations of friends and on my own long-standing perception of Subaru as an Innovator.  Nice car, nice looking, but Subaru is falling short on the details.  The $2,000 plus 2007 navigation system is shipping with a 2- year old 2005 vintage map CD. The companion audio system doesn't display title/artist/station information from CD player or radio on that big color screen like other cars in its class.  It is also loud in the passenger cabin."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,spokane steeler, 01/21/2008,Unbeatable Value,4,Researched and drove every SUV around (<$35K) and nothing excited me like a Tribeca.  Interior is stunning.  Used price is unbeatable.  Drives just fine despite negative reviews in the media.  Alfa Romero inspired front end will grow on you.  Created an emotional connection for me that was completely lacking in an explorer/edge/highlander/pilot/crv or virtually anthing else.  Also embraced the wisdom of buying used instead of new with 2 young children in the house.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Jonn, 04/02/2007,Satisfied,4,The engine is very responsive. the ride is very soft and comfortable. I can feel the traction cruising at curves.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,franco, 07/30/2007,What a Surprise,4,"We looked and test drove just about every style of SUV. It came down to the new LR2 Land Rover or the Tribeca, the last one we test drove. I've owned Porsche, Corvette, BMW, Acura, Toyota just to name a few. The interior and exterior of the Tribeca have excellent fit and finish. The ride is very stable and secure feeling. The standard and optional features are wonderful. We wanted an SUV that was going to be a keeper for the next 10 years and we found it. The power is satisfying and adequate for normal everday use. The style isn't ugly, its unique and exotic and it didn't take long to grow on us. We wouldn't have been happy with anything else. The new style looks like all the others."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,gmh8er, 01/26/2018,It has always taken me where I need to go,5,"My 07 B9 Tribeca has 140000 miles on it and it still runs great. The only repairs that have been needed is a sway bar bushing and two headlights. The fuel economy is not good but any vehicle this size has that issue. I average 18 in mixed driving but it has gone as low as 12 and as high as 26 on the highway. The AWD is awesome in all weather!  It did excellent on a trip from PA to NC and back at 120000 miles. It is one of the best riding vehicles I have owned, it is very smooth and comfortable. It's very surprising how well the 3.0 H6 can move this hefty vehicle. I am ready for a new vehicle but I still prefer the B9 Tribeca over new models. I have taken care of it and it has returned the favor.

subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Ed G, 09/17/2006,2007 Limited 7 Seater (Diamond Gray),4,"Sleek exterior and diamond gray color is awesome. Front grill is toned down with less chrome. Interior ergo is good and quality is up there with European cars. Ride is comfortable yet firm enough to handle twisties easily. Quiet ride as well. Brakes good. Could use a bit more power but adequate for an SUV. Honda Pilot a bit roomier since it's a box but after test driving both, you'll take the Tribeca for everything else it offers that the Pilot doesn't. "

subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Mike, 04/13/2007,Great !,4,"This was my first Subaru. We got this vehicle because of ist outstanding safety ratings. Only 6k miles so far it's been all good. The front end (exterior) is different, but it grows on you quickly. The interior is just great. Rear seats are on sliders like front seats, it makes for plenty of room even taller people. The AWD and vehicle stability control features make it sure footed in the northern winters. I'd recommend this vehicle to anyone."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Subaru convert from Toyota, 09/12/2019,Surprise I love it.,5,"I remember when it came out, how different looking it was.  I never thought I’d own one.  Just picked up a 2007 B9 and am nothing short of shocked at how much I like the car.   Now it doesn’t look that different and am realizing Subaru was ahead of the curve for mid size SUV.  Love the handling around town, plenty of torque off the line and drives like new with 140,000 miles on it.

It now has roughly 21,000 miles and I'm still very glad I purchased it.  My wife loved driving it in the snow this past winter.  Only minor complaints are 1. I have to stay on top of the service mgr at the dealership when it's in...which fortunately isn't often, and 2. rusty brake calipers."

subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Bill Bates, 05/13/2009,Aceleration,4,The editors review indicated less than good acceleration for the B9 Tribeca and I must say I disagree strongly.  My B9 has great acceleration entering and on the highway.  It will jump out from under you if you require it. Super highway car.

subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,rilbo, 02/25/2007,Underrated,4," B9 Tribeca is not getting the fair review as it should properly be compared to other foreign cars. The exterior and interior designs are fairly comparable to the luxury brands of Toyota, Honda and Nissan. You take a look at the safety features of the car you will be surprise its even better than those big 3 imports. I am enjoying my B9 Tribeca in terms of its luxury appointment and the price that I have paid. Try test driving one and compare it. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,asr, 09/21/2007,So far so good,4,"We bought it about 3 weeks ago, it has been great so far.  I was a little worried about the sluggish pick up, but it really has not been a big deal.  The car runs great, all the extras are awesome. I really love the puddle lights. It's my wife's car and it's the type of car that makes me feel good that she is safe."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,SW, 07/13/2007,Lovin' the Tribeca!,4,"We ended up buying the Tribeca unexpectedly due to another car being totaled. I've never owned a Subaru, and it wasn't even on the radar when we started shopping, but their $2750 incentive couldn't be beat. With about 2000 miles so far, I am very pleased. What sold me most was the wonderful interior - well-appointed with quality materials and a stylish dash design. Very upscale. The engine isn't as bad as some say. Power, while not thrilling, is certainly adequate. Great highway ride - quiet and smooth. The exterior design really grows on you as well. I probably see 50 Highlanders or Muranos for every Tribeca on the road. I like that it stands out from the SUV crowd. Well done, Subaru. "
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Subiedoooo, 07/31/2007,Subiedoooo!,4,Very nice SUV. Well designed; very comfortable interior and ride. Exterior look of '07 is an eyecatcher (disappointed Subaru changed '08 exterior - but I guess makes my '07 all the more special).  Gas mileage no surprise (good or bad). A couple of design/materials issues but dealer fixed with no problem.
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,Subarusud, 04/05/2008,Great car - disappointing build quality,4,"Love the looks and the design the best.  Drive is nice on highway, but bumpy on urban streets.  I have had a lot of rattles and they appear to be with the rear seat and the rear hatch.  Dealer can't seem to get it right.  Otherwise all of the features of the car are great!  Would be very happy but for the bumps and rattles.  Subaru should offer standard features on certain trim levels.  When buying this car it seems like I could never find the same model with the exactly the same features twice. "

Visually styling is distinct and pleasing. Interior cockpit feels young and vibrant. Exterior side and rear view especially is downright cool. No issues thus far in 16K miles except Nav system freeze up, but replaced immediatly. Mechanically sound as Lexus or Acura."
subaru,b9-tribeca,2007,nina, 04/13/2007,Boat on wheels,2,"Not as fun to drive as the manual shift Outback. Slow to get going from a stop and noisy engine rev makes it seem like an effort for the car to get going. Compared to my 11 year old Outback which has zippy pick-up with only four cylinders, this six cylinder car has the perfomance of a dinosaur. Nice interior styling though, but everything is electronic, including odometer. Gas hog."

After 2 Legacies in 17 years I had no doubts about Subaru quality.  Our lifestyle now said more room so I test drove other brands to see what whistles and bells were out there.  It compares very well in that regard. The tight turn radius is a pleasant surprise. The acceleration is there when needed. The ride is a little bit stiffer than our other car (Avalon). I'm getting 21+ MPG in mixed city and freeway driving on regular gas. The instrument panel and controls are easy to get used to. The seats are comfortable. I feel like I'm in a cockpit. "

However, I only have 2200 miles on this car, have had it in the dealer twice replacing the wiper blades and then replaced the whole wiper.  The wipers DO NOT clear during snow.  There is significant build up on the passenger side especially.  To me totally defeats the purpose of having an AWD vehicle if you can't see when you drive the darn thing!!"

I feel that the Subaru competes very well in that crowd.  Some don't like the exterior styling, but I think it sets the Tribeca apart from the crowd.  We get looks from people walking down the street all the time.  "

The design inside and out is so extremely comfortable and breath taking. This vehicle has everything and more than I could have ever wanted. It drives like a champ especially in the Miami, FL rain.

The check engine light came on and the engine was running really rough, so I did what anyone would do and took it to the dealership. They said they couldn't diagnose a problem until i had paid them $1,200. So I did, and then they said that my engine was busted and gave me an option to either pay and ADDITIONAL $12,000 for a new engine or simply buy a new car. I took my allegedly ""busted"" car to a local auto shop where they repaired it for even less than the $1,200 I primarily paid. NEVER BUYING FROM SUBARU AGAIN. THEY'RE CROOKS.

subaru,baja,2003,John V., 08/21/2015,Best Car I've Owned,5,"I dislike reviews of this vehicle/truck hybrid that say it is limited in functionality.  If one needs to haul drywall, then get a truck.  The Baja is an amazing vehicle with no problems after 12 years and 90,000 miles.  It's fun to drive and looks great.  I get offers to buy my car all the time, even though it is not for sale.  My wife encouraged me to treat myself to a new car.  I won't trade this Subaru in for even a Mercedes.  I owned a business for 10+ years and this was the perfect vehicle to take the kids back and forth while hauling boxes and landscaping equipment in the back. The Baja is a collector's car.  I own the yellow, which is sporty and fun.  Oh yeah, other drivers can't miss seeing it."
subaru,baja,2003,Trent, 02/16/2016,Just wouldnt die,4,"I had a 2003 baja which I bought at 100,000 miles. Over the next two years, I added on 60,000 miles using it as a commuter car. I bought the car with few mechanical problems, and over the long commutes and two years on an already dated car, I was rather impressed with its reliability. Over the course of those miles, the only repairs were brake pads, rotors, muffler repair, sealing an oil leak and a lower ball joint. I finally trades it in once an O2 sensor failed at 162,000 miles. All in all, pretty respectable considering it is 13 years old in the rust belt.
The bed was very useful for moving washers, dryers, beds, etcetera. I got my use out of it. I would buy another if they were still making them.

Consistent 1Qt oil consumed per 1k miles driven since got at 60k (and I'm assured by Subaru this is normal and not to worry about it, just fill it up every third gas fill up, no problem).
Both head gaskets just blew, along with failed battery and failed water thermostat.
To repair all problems, we're talking new battery, head gaskets, thermostat, new piston rings or short block replacement=$5500 at dealer (about equal to trade in value), which means good-bye or home rebuild.

subaru,baja,2003,Dave, 01/09/2006,"Great concept, lacking execution",3,"With 40k high speed and around town (yes, Home Depot!) driving, I have fallen out of love with the Baja, but still respect it.  Love the versatility and carrying capacity (quite amazing really, with some creativity). Handling at higher speeds is very good after replacement of the awful OEM tires. Fold down seats, bed extension, poke through door into bed, all great with signature AWD.  With the base 2.5l, acceleration is by appointment only. Tranny seems confused and gets in its own way. Wind noise has been a consistent problem, even after service that helped, some. And at 40k this has had more ""little"" failures and issues than seems characteristic of Subaru."

When we moved to Las Vegas it was in much better company but getting old. While in the dealership for service we watched the Baja's get unloaded, once I saw the yellow one I was hooked! Between the quality and finish I love this car. (No, it's not a truck!) What a blast dashing through the Las Vegas wash in this vehicle, great for off road adventures! I now participate in art festivals and only a minivan will out do this baby. We had a kayak carrier built we love everything about our Baja!"

My Baja gets good gas mileage, it's sharp looking and it's really fun to drive.  Mine is a 5-speed manual, and it will really get up and go.  In the mountains, I lock in the cruise at the speed limit and pass everybody else on the road because they can't make it up the mountain, and I go right up as if it were level ground.

I'm glad I waited, this is better. 22 mpg. 6 mile commute. 98,000 miles runs like a top. My GL-10 could air lift 3 inches for more ground clearance. A great feature for this one. Air noise, yep, it's a truck not a limo. Shift slock between 15 and 20, yep, but it makes up it own mind. AWD yep, but I'm not so sure about reverse. Maybe that why it has the hooks on the back. Michigan snow,no problem. Gawkers, yep,it's a guy thing. Not a babe magnet. I would buy another one in a minute."
subaru,baja,2003,Ben G. Jhump, 12/15/2015,Head gaskets from hell,1,"Bought this 2003 Baja with 105,000 miles on it because of Subaru's supposed reliability. Thought it would be a good car for my college bound kid. Ran fine for 6 months then I got a misfire code that turned out to be scorched exhaust valve (Subaru uses subpar valves according to my regular mechanic, who used to work at a Subaru dealership). $4000 later (at this reputable mechanic) I had new valves, head gaskets, valve cover gaskets, water pump, thermostat, throw out bearing, rear struts (yeah they went bad) and so on and so on. Within 1300 miles after the new head gaskets, started having overheating problem when I had been on the highway about 2 hours. never did it in town. never had overheating problem before all that work. took it to local Subaru dealership and their tests indicated hydrocarbons in the coolant (diagnosis: bad head gaskets), bad turn signal switch assembly. Took it back to original place and they warranted the head gaskets and throw out bearing and flush (including heater core - no blockages and no charge).
Got the car back, replaced the turn signal switch assembly and flasher relay just for kicks and ran it up our local mountain pass (highway) for about 45 minutes. Ran great no problems. 1 day later, after driving on the highway for about 2 hours on relatively flat highway, temp gauge crept up to about 3/4. Pulled off and let it cool down before overheat could occur. 
Time to pull the bandaid off and kick this one to the curb. 
Do yourself a favor. Avoid subarus. Known cooling problem that causes head gasket failure. If I'd only know before I bought it from that guy....

subaru,baja,2003,AnbAnimal2, 05/30/2009,Bought two of them,5,"In 2003 I first drove a Baja, liked it so much my son and I each bought one. This car has been a blast, from driving in a Blizzard in Vermont, to the rains of Hurricane Ivan in VA., to the north woods of Canada, the Beaches of Assateaque Island, and through the Rockies in Yellowstone for 5 months. Last year I got 35 mpg in the Rockies and up to 37 mpg on the way back to PA. It still amazes me that people still stop and look at the car. I have the differential cage added, tow package, an alpine stereo system, and a tonneau rear cover, + off Road light bar. This car is one of my favorites, both my son and I refuse to part with them. Mine is red and silver, his the yellow only produced in 2003."

reported, with every trip to the 
dealer, and I get the same

anything to do about it.  It is the way 
the engine is mounted.""  Sounds like a 
lot of BS to me.
I also have complained about a damp

Car like performance, truck like utility and unique looks combined into one.  We've gotten up to 31 mpg highway and average 23-24 mixed city/suburban driving.  We're looking for a new ""car"" now, but our only option is an 06 Baja (since sadly, Subaru discontinued these in 06).  We love the Subaru AWD and reliability but won't settle for a station wagon or minivan which is all they really offer now.  This was the BEST of all automotive worlds!"
subaru,baja,2003,Diana, 09/20/2009,My little Baja,4,"My little car has averaged 26-28 mph around town and 30-32 traveling.  Today it was rear-ended by a large SUV and may well be a total loss.  Fortunately the passenger cab was safe though the truck bed was left much shorter and I am fine.  The disappointment is that should I have to get another vehicle, it will not be a Baja.  I am very attached to my Baja.  It has been the best car I have ever owned. I bought the Baja new and have driven nearly 90000 miles.  I really have no complaints."
subaru,baja,2003,Mary Colletti, 03/09/2010,Great vehicle to own,4,For the most part I have had a lot of fun with this vehicle.  People stop me and ask if its a car or a truck.

subaru,baja,2003,doug madden, 09/17/2010,2003 Subaru Baja Sport,4,"I am 6'1"" and 225 lbs. I found the vehicle to be above ave. in room, ride and road noise. It performs beautifully at highway speeds and in curves, and has plenty of pep from 0- 60 mph. It hauls the 1/4 ton payload with ease and the bed extender allows for needed space to haul multiple appliances or building materials especially with the pass through design in the crew cab. It seats 4 mature adults with comfort and all controls are easy to reach for the driver. My Baja is a stick shift 5 speed and use it in my home rental business and as a toad for my motor-home. I have never owned a vehicle that I have received some many compliments and requests for information and viewings. I will own another one!"

atrocious piston slap after 2kmi.

Another Subaru dealer mechanic says
engine is not normal it needs further
investigation. Area Rep Ed Luksic
(Georgia Alabama), came drove it and
says that it is normal, not a problem,
they all have the same condition, his
own Baja does the same thing, should
last 130kmi or so.
The area Rep would have some concern if
I can prove that only ONE cyl is causing
the problem. Otherwise NO!"

real truck...one that you can acutally
do something with"".  I ended up looking
at this vehicle by accident.  Once I was
how versitile it was, I fell in love
with it.  The switchback is great to get
lumber and such in the vehicle.  With
the bed extender and the tailgate that
supports 700 lbs., there is little I
can't do with it!
The subaru awd system is incredible. 
the baja hugs all the mountainous
winding roads.  The ride is smooth over
bumpy roads; more so than any domestic
car i have travelled it.  The baja is
well constructed.  No squeaks or rattles.  
I would buy another in a heartbeat."

I have put many miles on it in my 
first year of owning it, due greatly 
to how fun it is to drive. It gets 
good gas mileage. So far the only 
thing I wasn't able to haul in it were 
sheets of 4x8 plywood. This vehicle

so far it has been perfect, no 
problems at all.  I have the non-Turbo 
four cylinder which I am very happy 
with.  The gas mileage is better than 
I expected, acceleration is fine.  The 
best feature of the Baja is it's 
versatility.  True, it doesn't have a 
full-size pick-up bed but with the 
extender I haven't missed that.  I 
really like the fact that I can move 
my kids home from college, have the 
bed packed full, and still have room 
for 4 people.  Intially I didn't like 
the two-tone color scheme (red and 
silver) but now that I have had it for

drive on dry pavement, and easy to
handle on ice and snow.  Everything
inthe truck feels solid - the doors, the

docked my truck a few points for

subaru,baja,2003,jdaniel, 04/24/2005,Excellent Vehicle!,4,"Wanted a crew cab truck. After much research I decided on the Baja because EVERYTHING about it is better than a truck other than the smaller bed.  Like the majority of people who own a truck, the bed is not used for work but rather for weekend purchases, garage sales, and trips to the home improvement stores. The Baja does just fine, gets better gas mileage, and as a used vehicle, it is a superb value.  This vehicle handles like a sports car, came standard with leather, auto, power everything including sunroof; and it comes with an AWD system and engine that have been time tested and proved reliable. "
subaru,baja,2003,yellowblaze, 09/17/2005,Most versatile daily driver yet!,4,"From off road trails to long road trips to trips to the home improvement store, our Baja has proven itself to be the best bang for the buck out there.  In less than 12 months it's gone from 2,800 miles at purchase to over 22,000 miles currently.  It's brought home siding, landscaping, parts for another car.  It took a Mustang hood from NY to FL in March - it fit right into the bed.  It did great on that trip as far as gas mileage, comfort and driveability.  It's gone down countless ""seasonal use highways"" - which range from dirt roads to little more than two ruts in the dirt - and handled them with ease (although more ground clearance would be nice).  All around, this is the best truck out there!"

No need to wait for a Turbo model to come out.  Not a sports car ... not an off road 4x4 ... but I can get from place to place, good roads and bad in remarkable time.  1st set of tires 78,000 miles.  Shocks replaced and clutch.  Carries more then you would think it does.  Smooth highway driver.  Absolutely invisible on the road allowing remarkably low travel time and exceptional mileage ... 25 mpg if I am really moving and can get 30ish within 5 mph of speed limit with cruise control.

We love its styling, it's comfortable, it's certainly not a car you see very often...like the RAV4. The vehicle is on the louder side with the frameless windows and AWD tires. Versatility...great for Home Depot during the day and dinning @ night. We seem to do about 28 hwy/24 city non turbo. Rearward visibility could be better; the c pillars generate a huge blind spot, as well as the rear headrests are non-movable."
subaru,baja,2003,PLP, 03/16/2008,Except for the AWD a poor winter car.,2,As far as winter driving goes: the wells below the wipers collect some serious snow & ice that will hamper the wipers if you don't clear it completely. Opening the door in winter deposits a nice clump of snow on your drivers seat. The passenger side of the front windshield will not clear completely in extreme cold weather. There isn't much space between the tire and mudflaps - the tires rub against the collected snow in winter and you can feel/hear the rubbing when you turn the wheel. The roof is hard to clear of snow but if you don't completely clear it you get an avalanche of snow that almost rips your wipers after it warms up and you put the brakes on. The biggest problem is hesitation.
subaru,baja,2003,CSTS, 08/25/2019,The little cruck that could :),5,"Alright let's keep this brief, because I doubt anyone wants to read a 10 page essay about why the baja is so cool! I've owned my Baja for over 3 years now, I am the third owner and have put just over 50k on the clock. Its sitting at 210k now and still runs strong. I've driven through everything from 6 feet of snow and ice to 100°+ of dry desert. Never once have I had an issue that I can think of. This thing is extremely reliable, if you are willing to take care of it. However that doesn't mean its perfect I have a few complaints with it. Mainly the engine is underpowered, the Auto transmission never knows what gear it wants to be in and the cabin space is cramped if you're over 5'10"" like myself. Other then that the rear squats a lot under heavy load (500+ lbs or so, I installed overload springs to counter that). Overall if you dont need a regular pickup on a daily basis or just want a reliable and versatile vehicle that has good mpg then this is an excellent option. Assuming you can find one for a reasonable price.

So, I decide that I will trade it -nope. I almost passed out when I received my offer. Tried to sell it, nobody wants it.

it means items are within easy reach.  
I test drove both a stick and auto, 
liked the auto better, very smooth and 
it doesn't transfer engine vibration 
through the steering wheel and shifter 
like the manual.  Gas mileage is a bit 
on the low side, but it has a big tank

focus.  After driving one, I was 
hooked.  The Baja was a fun little car 
to drive. After some thought, the trade-
off of a smaller cargo capacity for 
much better fuel mileage was worth it. 
The Baja gets 5-7mpg more than the 4x4 
compact trucks I was looking at.  Even 
on the Sport trim, there is a long list 
of standard features.  Seats are 
comfortable enough and there is decent 
headroom even with the moon roof.  
Could use a bit more in the way of 
power under the hood, but the Boxer-4 
is more than enough for everyday 
driving."
subaru,baja,2003,Nick Senanes, 09/17/2003,First Subaru,4,"Other car is a 99 Corvette and I'd 
rather drive the Baja."
subaru,baja,2003,bruce nole, 09/21/2003,My Double Duty Vehicle-2003 Subaru Baja,4,"Living in a mtn.desert, the Baja proved 
to be just the right combo vehicle I 
needed for daily use with the added 
utility of the versatile extendable 
bed. With the opt. bed extender & bike 
rack, this vehicle has proven to be the 
one I drive everywhere.  Complements 
from strangers started day 1.  Mileage 
with regular fuel at mid to upper 20's 
was a pleasant surprise.  A clutch 
replacement at nearly 18,000 mi should 
have been changed the first month.  The 
hepa air filter is very efficient.    
Backseat passengers are amazed 
by the comfort. Pellagrino bottles in 
any of the cup holders is a 1st.  So 
much better then a Truck."
subaru,baja,2003,kalins1, 09/27/2003,Most versatile vehicle I have driven,5,"Sure it won't haul 2 tons of top soil, 
but considering most truck owners only 
use their full beds 10 percent of the 
time (can't remember where that 
research came from), the Baja has 
plenty of hauling capacity. Plus, if 
you throw a hitch on it, you can haul a 
trailer and basically double the 
capacity. Did I mention that our Baja 
has been getting 26 mpg!!!"
subaru,baja,2003,wfb, 10/21/2003,Nice,4,"For the money, this is a wonderful 
vehicle. My daughter can't determine 
if it's a car or a truck, so it became 
the ""car/truck"". This is the second 
Subaru we've owned and the 
difference between the two is 
amazing. They have made a lot of 
improvements in handling and 
interior sound (the Baja is a lot more 
quiet than our 5 year old Outback). "

intending to buy an Imprezza WRX.  The 
wife convinced me to try a Baja that 
day too, and I went with the Baja.  
What a great ride!  It is stable, grips 
corners, and hauls the lawn clippings 
to the compost.  Yeah, I can't think of 
anything I really dislike about this 
vehicle.  It gives you the features of 
a pickup.  I make 28mpg on long trips.  
It snowed last week, and the thing is a 
TANK in the snow.  Couldn't be happier."
subaru,baja,2003,mddolfan, 11/17/2003,"New ""Brat"" is a blast!",4,"I was intrigued by the Baja from the 
first Subaru ""teasers"" in the Spring of 
2002.  After test driving the Baja next 
to a couple of compact pickups, I took 
it home.  I was a little worried about 
whether it would be practical or even 
useful as a ""truck,"" but after six 
months, I've enjoyed every minute of 
owning it.  Handling is great.  I had 
the rotor vibration problems mentioned 
in another review, but Subaru replaced 
all four and it rides fine now.  It's a 
little underpowered, but still moves 
when needed.  It has a VERY long list 
of standard features.  It's been useful 
for small and medium-sized loads.  
Overall, I couldn't be happier with it."

Child safety; Appearance; Fun; 
Economy; Performance; 4-doors; and 
cargo capacity.  Came down to four 
vehicles: Subaru Baja; Honda Element; 
Toyota 4Runner and RAV4.  Baja came 
out on top for me.  Local Subaru 
dealership beat my credit union on 
financing.  Also got the '03 Baja well 
below invoice.  Driving the 
Baja confirms the right choice: 
AWD, superb handling, tight, solid, 
and quiet.  Fuel economy that is 
good.  Audio upgrade sounds 
great, and more useful features than a 
Swiss Army knife.  Work for a tech

subaru,baja,2003,subguy, 03/10/2003,Listen To The Owners,5,"Went looking on a whim.  Surprised at 
how large and rugged this vehicle was. 
Drives great, tight. Interior reminds 
me of BMW (in a good way). Went with 
the all silver design. Looks sharp. 
Sub. does a disservice by using 
the yellow and silver with those 
mickey mouse  spot lights as 
its ""show"" car.  In monochrome, this 
car would appeal to much wider 
audience.  You'll especially 
love this vehicle if your used to 
driving alone or with only a front 
seat passenger.  That way, you can use 
the folded down rear seat area as 
your ""trunk""  (the tinted rear windows 
serves well to hide valuables)  and 
the flat bed for the occasional cargo 
haul."

While driving you can enjoy excellent handling and very smooth highway driving. On the very next day you can haul and/or tow a reasonable amount of supplies and/or materials for various household projects.  While the Baja is clearly not for everyone, the versatility this car offers is impressive.  Further, the way this vehicle handles different driving conditions (e.g., snow, rain, rough terrain) is amazing.    "

subaru,baja,2003,ObiJuanAK, 02/28/2007,Alaska Baja,4,"The Baja has everything I expected from this vehicle. As long as you don't expect a pickup's hauling ability and volume, it meets my requirements (hauling, commuting and all weather capability) to a T. The frigid Interior Alaska winters have not uncovered any shortcomings, other than the silly thermometer that only records down to -22 ºF. Fuel economy could be better, but not bad for an AWD vehicle. Good long distance comfort, not so fun on tight and twisty roads. The precision of the gearbox leave a lot to be desired. A little tight for two people in full winter gear, but in the summer it is just right. Shame Subaru decided to discontinue the Baja."
subaru,baja,2003,bratissimo, 04/21/2003,Subaru reliability?,3,"The first time it rained the sunroof 
leaked and had to be replaced. I had it 
in 3 times for running rough and dying 
on start up.  The dealer said ""Subaru's 
are quirky"" After 5 months of running 
poorly check engine light came on, and 
it was towed to the nearest dealership 
who found a defective MAP sensor and 
fouled plug wire.  7 days later it was 
back on a tow truck in a different 
state wit the same problem. I spent my 
vacation getting my car fixed and NOT 
skiing.  I have a 23 year old subaru

happened to Subaru's legendary quality?"

subaru,baja,2003,KYLE MARCRUM, 09/27/2007,I'm loving it,4,"I love this car. It's quick, absorbs bumps like crazy and it turns heads. Hauling and payload are minimal but if you want that you'll buy a real truck. I camp and paintball a lot. It's perfect to just throw all the dirty stuff in back and keep your interior clean. Maintenance is simple to do. The versatility is amazing for something that looks so small. I would recommend for anybody."
subaru,baja,2003,HKF, 09/30/2007,03 Baja,4,"Red on silver clad with graphite cloth interior. Optional bed cover and hitch. Great car, sticks to the road like velcro. Upgraded with aftermarket audio to provide handsfree bluetooth, roadnoise inerferes. Transmission has a mind of it's own, upshifts are unpredictable and downshifts let the engine revs hit the red line. The soft bed cover is more work than I expected but keeps the bed clean and mostly dry. Overall, fun to drive and really unique. Defies categorizing."
subaru,baja,2003,GlennH, 05/02/2003,Weird to look at...but I'm on the inside,4,"I have to admit that I haven't quite 
decided whether this car/truck is 
attractive or just goofy looking. But 
driving it is a kick! Sure it could use 
a little more power (but I hear Subaru 
is addressing that in 04 by adding 
turbo.) But this vehicle drives 
well...handling is good, interior 
comfort great and otherwise a well 
thought out, very versatile car/truck 
thing. I don't REALLY need a pickup - I 
learned this lesson from owning a 
Ranger and a Toyota Pickup previously, 
but I can't quite come to terms with 
owning a ""family car."" The Baja walks 
the line. So, if you're anything like 
me, this may be the vehicle for you 
(and god bless you!)"
subaru,baja,2003,Peter Troost, 05/02/2003,Take a chance!,3,"I have been very happy with my Baja, 
but fair warning -- people either love 
it or hate it.  The pickup bed is great 
for hauling garbage to the dump or 
throwing in the hockey bag.  One 
drawback, however, is that you can't 
really drive with the passthrough open 
in the winter because it's cold!  The 
only way to carry long items such as 
skis in the winter is on the roof.  The 
stereo is garbage.  Finally, mine has 
had a squeak in the back seat somewhere 
that has been very hard for the dealer 
to locate and is very annoying.  Be 
sure to test drive the actual car you 
are going to buy."
subaru,baja,2003,jackmanjac, 05/09/2003,Ultimate Compromise,4,"Great compromise.  Fits in my garage.  
Better to commute 30 miles one-way in 
than a truck.  Carries 99.9% of 
everything that I need.  Handles great, 
and rides great too.  It is a little 
low on power at low RPM's, but the 5-
speed makes it liveable.  It is also 
geared a little short.  85 MPH is 
almost 4000 RPM's."
subaru,baja,2003,hazzardwarning, 05/15/2003,Steve's Review,5,"I love to drive this car.  So far I 
have not had any problems with it.  I 
went from a dodge ram with a 360 
engine to this, so I can really tell 
the difference in fuel useage.  It 
does lack a lot of get up and go 
though (though it is not bad for a 4 
cyl).  I would like to see a 6 cyl or 
the higher performance 4 (such as the 
WRX).  Though I know that there is no 
possiblity of this, I would also like 
to see a special edition STI version 
of the BAJA (such as the WRX STI).  If 
I had it to do over again, I would 
have made the same decision in 
purchasing this vehicle."

lots of experience driving in the snow,

deals."
subaru,baja,2003,ndentel, 05/19/2003,Love the Baja!,4,"What a great vehicle! Have had it for 
3 months and love it. The bed is way 
more functional than it appears at 
first, especially with the bed 
extender. We can easily take scuba 
gear, ball gear, bikes, kayaks, and 
skis wherever we want to go without 
using huge amounts of gas. The 
interior is comfortable, feature-rich, 
intuitive, and stylish. There is a 
solid feel that is not apparent in 
many vehicles in its price range. The 
AWD is a dream and it's fun to drive. 
Take it from the ones who actually own 
and drive the Baja every day-it's a 
great value that should bring a smile 
to your face."

that can carry items that are extra 
tall. I looked at otherpick-ups but the 
fuel economy is not that good, 
especially with 4wd. When I 
looked at the Baja and test drove it my 
mind was made up and bought it. If you 
don't really need a truck and use it 
the way it really was intended for and 
a car or station wagon is not as 
versitile. Then the size of the Baja

be what your your looking for."

I didn?t need a whole lotta truck, just 
for the occasional trip to Home Depot, 
etc.  So, other than having some kind of 
truck bed, I was more concerned with the 
day-to-day items (handling, fuel 
mileage, comfort, reliability, safety).  
The Baja is the only truck that excels 
in all of these items.
Yes, I know I can?t haul 4x8 sheets of

subaru,baja,2004,RDC913, 04/05/2010,Super Subaru,4,I just got my BAJA Turbo and I love it. All my friends and even my wife have been against the BAJA because of its looks. Personally I love the way it looks. I have never been one to let anyone influence my decisions. That's why it's parked in my driveway now. So far I am very pleased with it and I'm very glad I got the Turbo. It's very powerful and the functional hood scoop looks awesome!! The interior is simple but I sold my BMW 325 convertible to get one of these so it's a slight adjustment. I snowboard and wanted a vehicle that would do well in the snow. The reviews from other BAJA owners sold me. I can't wait to use it this coming winter. I wish these would come back into production.

all the stability of my wife's Forrester. This is 
not a luxury car, but more of a lad's car -- the 
small pickup bed is going to be useful when 
the snow melts and the weather improves. 
Gets a lot of attention, unusual on the streets

on mine to arrive from the factory, 
but I have driven each version of the 
Baja made since it's intro in '03.  
For those of us who need a small 
truck, but not a buckboard-riding, 
fuel sucking steel can, there's now a 
wagon-based wannabeatruck that handles 
real-life in the best of fashions."
subaru,baja,2004,Bertag, 01/29/2004,This truck is a blast,4,"My Turbo Baja handles like a sedan, 
will haul my bicycles or dirt bike and 
accelerates like a musclecar.  The 
interior is well designed and very 
comfortable.  The five speed was hard 
to find but well worth the effort.  If 
80% of the full size truck drivers 
would admit to themselves that this is 
all they really need for hauling and 
off road operation---they would be a 
lot happier on a daily basis."
subaru,baja,2004,AlliRock, 01/30/2004,Fun Car,4,"I love this vehicle.  It maneuvers 
great.  It is just fun to drive."

very fun
acceleration is great and i weight 270#
all wheel drive is fantastic
reliability will be rated later"
subaru,baja,2004,davescomp, 02/27/2004,Baja Rocks!,4,"This vehicle has just what I wanted, 
and everything I needed. The ride, 
space adn comfort of a car, and the 
ability to throw whatever I need in the 
back. I don't have to worry if I am 
hauling something dirty or smelly, and 
if it is something long, I can open the 
back end. It may seem like a short bed 
at first, but with the conversion of 
teh back seat and the bed extender, it 
is not bad at all. I have brought home 
full sized panneling, lumber, lattice, 
bags of concrete, and hauled many other 
things like plants and muddy yard 
tools. All I had to do was spray out 
the back end!"
subaru,baja,2004,Nick Senanes, 03/07/2004,Other car a Vette &still lovin the Baja!,5,"I have a Magnetic Red Corvette to play 
with, but I gotta tell you the Baja 
gets more looks and compliments.
The car is so easy to drive, the engine 
is smooth and powerful enough to take 
on all but the fastest at stoplights.  
The car can easily top 120 mph if you 
like and the harder you drive it, the 
better it performs.  All wheel drive 
lets the the Subie and you laugh at 
snow and ice.   Rain , Hah! Handles 
like dry ground.   

Gas mileage runs from 22 if driven like 
your in a WRC race and up to 32 on high 
way.     
This is a car I would recommend to 
anybody .  I flat out love it."
subaru,baja,2004,Dr.D., 03/24/2004,The fun truck alternative,4,"Replaced an old trusty Ford Ranger, and
worried about the fact that the Baja is
not a 'truck'.  I can still do almost
everything I need to do, and many things
I couldn't do before.  The Baja is just
plain fun, especially with the 5-speed.
 It really hugs the road and gives you a
feel of control.  There's plenty of
power in the 4-cyl with the 5-speed
(drove the automatic and it felt a
little sluggish), and the mileage beats
most competitors.  The back seat isn't
great, but I sit in the front!  Have not
regretted this purchase."
subaru,baja,2004,pditty97, 04/05/2004,Subaru Baja Turbo (all silver),4,"I have had the baja turbo for a little 
over a week now.  I must say this 
caruck (pronounced car'-uck) is a great 
vehicle.  All reviews that I read 
before buying this truck mentioned the 
lack of space overall when mostly 
compared to a pickup. I bought this 
vehicle for the little home projects 
that i want to do, my active lifestyle 
(biking/hockey, etc) and this vehicle 
suits my needs well.  You get the 
vesatility of being able to go to home 
depot or you get the great feeling of 
leaving everyone in the dust off of the 
start/w/turbo around the neighborhood.  
...steering wheel always hitting my leg 
on the way in and to cumbersome to 
raise and lower.  "
subaru,baja,2004,Schafdog, 04/10/2004,Are you kidding me?,4,"I am sold big time. I bought an all 
silver, manual, turbo and boy can she 
fly- and a real eye catcher.  This car 
is an absolute blast to drive. 
It is a sports car with the ability to 
perform all the functions of a small 
truck. Who knew!? 
It is a four seater but lots of room 
and very comfortable and the sound 
system is excellent. I wanted 
something reliable, fun and versatile 
and this car is all of that. They make 
a cover for the backend so essentially 
you can store stuff like a trunk or 
use it for hauling anything- the 
versatility is insane. Suburu 
reliability, amazingly fun, AWD! and 
overall versatility of the vehicle - 
all at an amazing price."
subaru,baja,2004,Rob Daum, 04/20/2004,You can't beat it,5,"This is our second Subaru this year. My 
wife drives an 04 LLBean Outback. Funny 
she like this almost as much. The ride 
is car like and the seating is 
comfortable ( front ) back seat is fine 
for kids or adults on a short trip. 
Mileage is improving with each fill up. 
Get a lot of comments 
like ..cool..awsome..etc. Get one you 
wont be sorry"

subaru,baja,2004,mikeyboy, 07/22/2004,satisfied with versatile fun vehicle,4,"Bought this vehicles as almost an 
impulse purchase on New Year's eve--
replacing 12 years of minivan loyalty.

It's easy to park, fun in traffic and 
on curvy roads--even just expressway 
ramps.

My only reservation is about 
acceleration into traffic--but, 
meanwhile, responsiveness at highway 
speeds is terrific--witness 2 
expressway speeding citations within 15 
months--for 84 in a 65 mph zone--with 
no traffic around."
subaru,baja,2004,Macster, 07/31/2004,best deal I have had,5,"Very comvertable ride. good pickup on 
inclines. good gas milage, I averaged 
25.6 MPG over a one year period. I 
drive an average of 100 miles aday 7 
days a week. I have had it for 16 months
(480 days) I have 47,762 miles on it 
now. This was the first subaru I have 
owned , certianly not the last.
There are two drawbacks that I have 
found 1)is that there is wind noise 
once you get up over 65 MPH. I have had 
the dealer deal with it on several 
visits, every time they fix it every 
time it comes back. 2) it is hard to 
see when you backing up."
subaru,baja,2004,Mike Wilhelmson, 08/30/2004,ONE of a Kind,5,"I really enjoy driving my baja. Great 
build quality. Many upgrades available

subaru,baja,2004,itsme0729, 05/13/2006,Nightmare..,3,"At miles 6729, the transmission burnt.  Subaru will not install a new one.  Forced me to accept a re-built transmission.  The re-built transmission after 500 miles went bad also.  It started locking up in reverse gear and when driving around the corners.  The service department would not pay attention until I left the car at the dealership and threatened to sue under the Lemon Act.  They finally called in the Subaru technical rep who offered to replace it with a new transmission if I was going to keep the car.  I said, yes, got the new transmission and then traded it for a new 2005 Turbo model in April 2005.  The transmission on Baja is very poorly designed. It's very noisy to drive."
subaru,baja,2004,fyr1, 11/26/2006,Subaru Baja,4,"Great utility truck, only complaint is mileage dives 30% when towing 2000 lbs. It really could have used an extra speed in the automatic which would of made it more economical. At 70mph the engine is revving 3000 rpm. For a daily commuter and utility truck it is great more comfortable and economical than the Ford Ranger I traded in."
subaru,baja,2004,Lucas Martin, 05/25/2016,"Sooby rooby roo, I love you!",5,"This car works great for fun loving people like me and my friends.  It looks amazing on the outside, leathery and comfortable on the inside, and can take all kinds of rough treatment from rough Colorado off roading. One of my favorite features, is the truck bed, where we like to hang out and get fresh air. The only problem is that there is only 4 seats in the back, and the gearsift is wobbly. Still, this car is an amazing car, and I would way rather have this over a lexus or mercedes.
"
subaru,baja,2004,derek, 04/13/2008,So far so good,5,"After doing much research, and based on my needs, I decided to purchase a used Baja.  Finding one in Pittsburgh, it was a 5 speed turbo, and I can say thus far that I am very happy with it.  I do a lot of driving and the Baja is a very enjoyable ride, from the power. The sport like handling and feel, then mix in the versatility of the pick up bed, plus its good and/or unusual look, I am very satisfied so far.  Then add in Subaru safety and reliability, I guess you can say I am now a convert. I picked up a bed cover, a bike hitch carrier, plus a few other accessories, and am good to go."
subaru,baja,2005,SManning, 11/18/2009,JUST got it paid for :( !,3,"I have mixed feeling about my Suby.  I have had a few problems but nothing prepared me for this: at 71K, I'm replacing the turbo!! JOY! To the tune of $1800.  This despite babying it with regular maintenance. I am thoroughly disgusted that the first foreign car I've bought in years is less dependable than my Jeeps and Durangos. I purchased this car for its reliability and planned to drive it 200K. What a rip!"
subaru,baja,2005,Mike Custodio, 08/08/2010,Perfect match for my active lifestyle,4,"Bought my turbo baja with 56k on it, and racked up 10k in 6 months. While there is both positive and negative attitude about it, the turbo baja matches my lifestyle perfectly. It excels in Back country roads, carrying kayak, mtn bikes, and occasional landscaping items. Performance and handling excel that of a true truck. I love trucks, but I love my baja better. Downsides: Get the Bed ext. Turbo lag and reluctant downshifts sap power. But once you get going, your gone. Frequent oil changes: every 3,000 miles for turbos. My ABS unit somehow decided to fail. It will cost $1200 to replace, dealership unsure what caused the failure.  Otherwise, this subie matches my lifestyle and driving habits"
subaru,baja,2005,ellen, 12/16/2008,Bummed about my Baja baby,4,"It was initially love @ 1st site but bloom soon faded. 1st issue, dash panels around A/C controls started peeling upon touch, never replaced. Bad experiences w/dealership caused me to go to another Subaru dlr serv. dept when brake problems began & driver window wouldn't close tightly. Was asked if car had been in accident because bolts were missing on one side @ brake apparatus. While under warranty, brakes were worked on @ least 3 times. No permanent resolution on brakes or ANY other issues I ever presented. Extended wrnty doesn't cover brakes & I'm still having problems. Told my family to have car fully inspected if accident occurs due to brake issue - and sue the pants off of Subaru! "

Minimal maintenance, record of 220,000 miles before 1st belt change. AWD with FL rain, wonderful! 24 mpg with full load. Very satisfied. A little worried about inevitable future maintenance due to mileage."
subaru,baja,2005,Lucas Martin, 05/31/2016,"Sooby rooby roo, we love you!",4,"This car is amazing. I love how it looks. It really fits the Colorado lifestyle. Haven't taken it to the shop in two years and still runs like new. The back is really cool. If you are a fun loving personand you live near the mountains, I highly recommend this car for you. It does have a few issues. One is that there are only 4 seats in the car. Another one is that the gearshift is pretty wobbly. But overall, this car is the most amazingest car ever.

subaru,baja,2005,evillabrat69, 08/09/2011,so far....REALLY FUN!!,4,"I bought this car 2 months ago with 87k on it, and have been loving it!! with a 50 mile commute each way to work, its quiet & very comfortable. i've done some light off-roading and have no complaints. my fiancee prefers to take the subie when ever we go anywhere together. no complaints on the 25 mpg. off line acceleration could be better, and the steering column could be a little longer (im tall and have to reach a bit)


Overall it beats the pants off the 2001 neon i traded in on it!!!
so far this is the best looking, 2nd best performing (1998 pontiac grand prix gt was faster) i have owned. 

I really love this vehicle! "
subaru,baja,2005,jhk008, 01/21/2007,Beach Buggy Delux,5,"As a coastal geologist, I chose this vehicle to use in post-storm beach surveys.  It has yet to be stuck in the sand...has hauled all the survey equipment I ever needed (plus 6 students in the bed and three more in the cab), gets great gas mileage, and has yet to have any major (or minor) maintenance issues.  Did all the scheduled maintenance on time...had new brakes put on at 40K miles...still running on the original tires at 47K miles and have tread to spare.  Recently used my beach buggy to haul 2 12' 2X4s, 8 sheets of 3/4"" CDX plywood, 2 square of shingles, and a roll of 30# felt...all in one trip.  I've pulled trailers and boats with no problems.  Great car!"
subaru,baja,2005,john, 08/05/2008,Our 5th Subaru,5,"Subaru has to be building the best cars in North America. We have now owned a '92 SVX, two Outbacks, and now we have two Bajas. We were very impressed with our '05 Baja Sport, and when the '99 Outback came up for major maintenance, we traded for another '05 Baja Turbo.  Wow, fast, fast, fast... gets up and moves like our 6-cyl. SVX did.  Our Bajas are comfortable, affordable to drive, and never fail us. It is a shame to see Subaru making  marketing errors. The Tribecca/B9 frankly is an over-priced, underperforming gas-hog that few will buy, (we test drove one) and Outbacks lack versatility. Baja was never marketed well, and no one knew they existed until they were discontinued, glad we got em."
subaru,baja,2005,Jim Silvania, 02/13/2005,More Fun Than An Outback,4,"Traded a 2002 Outback for a 2005 Turbo Baja. Turbo a lot more fun to drive and the Baja suits my purposes as a small pick-up. Great car for me. Wouldn't mind a cover for the truck bed but $1,000 a little too pricey. Most enjoyment is to watch all the young kids catch up to me and watch them laugh when they see an old man zipping around in such a youthful looking vehicle. It is fun to drive, sun or snow."
subaru,baja,2005,trbajalv, 03/27/2005,Baja Turbo is the way to go!,4,"A very fun truck to drive, feels more like a car.  The AWD set up is fantastic.  The turbo is the only way to go, it gives the engine the oomph the normally aspirated engines lack.  You notice a little turbo lag on the normal auto transmission mode, but shift it to the sport shifter and away you go.  The Baja Turbo is worth it."
subaru,baja,2005,gayleen jaeger, 03/30/2005,Head Turning Winner,5,"Where else can you get a four seater, four door, pick-up with extended bed and roof rack that is a head turner every where you go? All this and be rated as a passenger car for insurance? I've never had a problem and get through  Buffalo winters with ease."
subaru,baja,2005,Bob, 05/01/2005,Baja,4,I recently purchased the Subaru Baja  Sport for my commute to work.  Although it's only been about one month since I bought the Baja it has proven to be a good choice. I am getting 28mpg. It's fun to drive and though it's no sports car it handles and accelerates good enough for me.
subaru,baja,2005,JoAnn Schreckengost, 06/28/2005,MY BAJA,5,"We were trying to downsize and sold our van and Chevy S-10 for 2004 Baja.  It's everything I've ever wanted in a vehicle, easy to drive. Now I can drive at night with the fog lights; every car should have them.  It is NOT a car for a pack rat unless you throw all your ""stuff"" in the bed; very little room for tissues, glasses, all the things women want to carry, but the other EXCELLENT features far outweigh the incidentals."
subaru,baja,2005,Sparky Gump, 07/04/2006,Baja Rocks,5,"I'm a former Ford Ranger owner.  When gas hit $2.00 a gallon (remember that?) I knew I had to ditch my gas hungry 4x4 for a more reliable, better designed small pickup.  Problem was you need 4 wheel drive on a pickup to get traction on snowy roads and 4 wheel drive trucks - even the ""smaller"" ones - get lousy gas mileage.  One day when my wife was getting her Forester serviced I saw my perfect car/truck, the Baja.  I bought one as soon as I could and I have no regrets.  I've got the outside bed for hauling dirty stuff like soil, garbage and kerosene.  Inside seating for four and 26 mpg overall!  Subaru is foolish for not marketing these vehicles and even more stupid for ceasing production."
subaru,baja,2005,Shad3d, 07/28/2004,Two4one,5,"This is an awesome mini-truck.

You have both a quality sports car and 
the utility of a small pick up truck.

It drives/handles like a european 
sports sedan with comfort and pep, and 
you have the open trunk space for 
those many or large items during 
shopping or moving."

well, and for paddlers and/or cyclists, 
it is very practical.  4-wheel drive

the Baja at the lot and it really 
caught my eye. I took one out for a 
test drive and it was sweet! Then the 
guy asked me to drive the turbo 
version...so I did. That was all it 
took! I never had a car with such pep 
and its so much fun to drive. The

Drove the car off the lot new years eve, then drove up to a friends house in New York. Have driven the Baja home after work in a snow blizzard-car didn't slip once. Was pretty skeptical about the AWD at first, but after this trip home, i'm convinced it's GRRRRRRREAT! Felt safe the whole ride. "

subaru,baja,2005,PARA 958, 05/05/2005,Happy Days with My Subaru Baja,5,"Have had 3 other Subarus but this is the first Baja.  Love the looks of this car, the comfort of the well designed seats, and the fuel economy (20 city, 28 hwy). Love the comments I receive from people and the ability to haul light items in the bed.  The bed extender was a nice touch.  Looked at the Turbo model but decided against it because of having to use premium fuel.  For those who need a car to zip here and there on errands, this car meets those needs. Back seats are comfortable and up above the front. Backseat passengers love it.  Wish the rear window would raise up.  But other than that, no complaints about my Baja."
subaru,baja,2005,disgusted, 11/23/2006,No more Subarus for OUR family,2,"Let's see...the transmission went out at 3,000 miles. The carpet had to be replaced because of a poorly designed mat-holder. The trim is crooked, the mileage stinks, the warranty offered by the company is not comparable with other manufacturers. Should I keep going? Oh I suggested a friend buy a Subaru as well and her review would be similar to mine...NOT TOO HOT! Together, our invoice paperwork for all the trips we've made to have items examined/repaired could reforest a small country."

February dumped the most snow ever on record in my area - no challenge for my Baja!  March has only just begun and I drove to work today on icy roads, safely and confidently.  I don't get trapped on the interstate between those rude truck drivers...I just whiz by before they can even begin to play their ""chicken"" games.  The rear cargo bed area proves to be very handy.  I can store things out of view and locked up. I just cannot imagine owning anything but a Subaru.       "

subaru,baja,2005,Nicole, 06/28/2005,Got Mud?,4,I love this little truck. It is fun to drive. I live off of a dirt road and this truck handles great on the dirt and in the snow. I love that it is enough of a truck that I can haul gardening equipment. The CD player is also better than I expected. In my last Subaru the CD player skipped all the time and the new one I have to hit something pretty hard to get it to skip. It is an overall fun truck.

Put off buying a four cylinder as figured it would not offer any thrill when you needed power to pass. Was totally shocked at how much the turbo pushes it right out in front of the others. The comfort is amazing. Only one drawback is the premium fuel to fill. This is little to sacrifice to enjoy driving again. I love my Baja turbo in garnet red. It certainly gets the looks.
subaru,baja,2005,mriccar, 08/14/2005,Baja Fun,4,I'm finding the Baja to have great versitaity and fun to drive. I have never seen one in my local area and am enjoying the inquisitive looks I am getting. It's a great vehicle that handles like a car but provides small truck capabilities.

subaru,baja,2005,vv, 07/12/2004,Overall Excellent Vehicle!,4,"I'm an officer in the Military

bring myself to part with $35,000+, 
plus I was afraid the roads in Alaska 
and Canada would be a little too much 
for the first two.  So, I opted for 
the Baja Turbo.  I'm very glad I did!  
I immediatedly drove the vehicle 
4K miles through Cali, Oreagon, 
Washington and Canada.  The manual 
turbo is awesome!  I only wish it had 
the same new engine design as the 
Outback and the Legacy."
subaru,baja,2005,Badger 777, 07/21/2004,Subaru Baja,5,"Great overall performance and fuel

horsepower without sacrificing the fuel 
mileage, (200 hp would be perfect). The 
ride is excellent in town an on the 
highway. I really have no complaints it 
is a well designed vehicle and the best 
part is it was assembled using U.S.

subaru,baja,2005,NoritakeDR, 09/11/2004,Great fun to drive,4,"Stylish good looks, great handling, and 
a very fast motor make this car the 
most fun vehicle I have ever owned. I 
test drove the non-turbo and found the 
engine to be lacking. The downside of 
the turbo is poorer gas milage and you 
must use premium fuel, but the vehicle 
is extraordinarily responsive, 
particularly on hills.

I drove the car on a trip of 300 miles 
and it is a bit wearing over the long 
haul because of the light weight 
compared to a sedan which I previously 
owned, however in town the vehicle is a 
real blast to drive.

This is a great car for weekend lovers."
subaru,baja,2005,gmroper, 10/09/2004,Baja - Arriba,4,"What a fun car to drive.  Though the 
car has been out for 1year+, it still 
draws looks.  Comfortable, peppy and 
utilitarian.  I've hauled all but the 
biggest cargo and had fun doing it.  In 
town milage is great compared to other 
vehicles I've driven, and though over 
the road could be better (I get 29mpg) 
it is a terrific.  My wife has one as 
well and she likes it better than the 
sporty cars she has driven before.  In 
short, a fun truck, sporty but useful.  
No hesitation to recommend it to anyone 
wanting something different."
subaru,baja,2005,NekoJCat, 11/09/2004,2005 Baja Sport,4,"Great little car, I was considering the 
Turbo model, but when it came down to 
it the Sport was sufficient for my 
needs. It still has quite a bit of kick 
to it, and does a very impressive jump 
off the line. I've had it about a month 
now, gets looks around town, some good 
some bad, but that was my draw to it. 
It's a unique car, and it really is a 
blast to drive."
subaru,baja,2005,Gene Forget, 11/26/2004,2004 BAJA Turbo,5,"I actually own a 2004 Turbo Baja.
This is the second Outback type that 
we own, and my wife and I love it.
I wanted a WRX, but I couldn't justify 
it, as it wasn't practical. THIS, I 
can justify, as it serves many 
purposes.
So far mileage is good, it is still 
breaking in, and it is just plain old 
fun to drive."
subaru,baja,2005,Paul, 01/02/2005,Well Rounded Choice,4,"Despite a long delay in receiving this

purposes well.  I had owned a 2003 Baja 
as well.  This is a great improvement.  "
subaru,baja,2005,Diane Garmo, 01/27/2005,I love my Baja,5,My Red Baja is the perfect vehicle for me. It has just enough cargo space as well as passenger seats. I am able to enjoy the best of car and truck features with the reliability of all wheel drive.
subaru,baja,2005,shilo, 02/06/2005,Best Ever!,5,This is the best car I have ever owned and I have owned many. The Baja handles great in rain and snow.  It is just plain fun to drive. There is nothing that I do not like about it. My last car was a horrible 2003 Mustang convertible.  I will be a Baja owner for as long as Subaru keeps them in their lineup.

subaru,baja,2005,charles young, 04/02/2005,new owner,4,"I am new in the Subaru area. I bought a Baja to play with. I like it very much, but it is to early to really give an experienced report. Will do that later. So far it has been what I expected."
subaru,baja,2005,From Western NY, 04/26/2005,not too bad,4,"PRO: All wheel drive - been through two Buffalo winters and it goes anywhere. Getting 26-28 mpg in the summer. Have used the pass-trough more than expected, a lifesaver. The bed extender is handy. Glad I didn't get the turbo, don't need it in the city and gas prices. CON: The stupid engine has ""major hesitation"" when starting in first gear. Snow tends to pack under the front windshield wiper/hood. Opening the door in winter always causes snow to fall onto the seat. NITPICKS: Windshield glass is wavey, seat bolsters are too big - hard to get into/out of the front seat, radio sounds like the 1950's, cup holders are short and in the way. Windshield won't clear 100% on extremely cold days."
subaru,baja,2005,Victor, 05/23/2005,Love My Toy Baja,4,"Bought my Baja to replace a 98 Isuzu Pickup. This is the best trar, (truck/car - thats what my wife calls it), that I ever owned. Power everything standard. I drive about 1,000 miles a week and feel save and secure.  Great on the highway and fun in town. A real head turner. Live in FL and with the bad rains, have no problem. No pull when hitting puddles. Drives true and straight.  Will recommend any Subaru to anyone. Can't beat AWD."
subaru,baja,2005,Polishsausag, 06/16/2005,GET POWER SEATS,4,"I love everything about this vehicle except for the non power seats.  If I could have any one feature over again, I would get power seats.  I may try to get my hands on one from a junkyard.  The bed is amazingly useful.  I have used it for a ton of large objects, and the hose off ability is also great.  The interior is quite stylish and the turbo definitely makes it feel like a high powered six cylinder.  I am a tall guy and wanted a truck that handled like a car and got the gas mileage of a car.  This vehicle is everything I wanted.  My only complaint -  no power seats only recline and slide back.  Power seats tilt and adjust in many ways.  Go for the power seats, and it will be pure fun!"
subaru,baja,2005,baja, 01/31/2006,love my Baja,4,"Recently drove 4,200 miles in a week and enjoyed every one of them."
subaru,baja,2005,SoAnn Ott, 09/20/2006,Stamina plus,4,Goes places that a regular or four wheel drive vehicle wouldn't attempt. Streamlined looks besides. This is the truck of our dreams.
subaru,baja,2005,Sacttwndude, 10/31/2006,What a Great little Truck!,4,"Bought this crossover because I was tired of high gas prices and low mileage on my Toyota 4x4 Tacoma Crew Cab, and also the family SUV. However I was really addicted to the AWD on the Hyundai Santa Fe...which was also a wonderful car, but costly in gas and low mpg. Both truck and suv were new. So sold them both and got my first Subaru...a Baja. Definitely best choice, took it off road; no problems handled like a trooper, never got stuck. Took it on a cross country trip, perfect the whole distance, not a problem, and decent to good on the gas for a full time AWD vehicle. Definitely will consider another one, too bad Subaru will not be making them, maybe another manufacturer will start to make them. "
subaru,baja,2005,Renee, 11/15/2006,Most Fun I Ever Had!,4,"This is such a great vehicle.  I lusted after the Brat in the 70's but never got the chance to own one.  Thirty years later when it was time to buy a new car, this new version was on my list.  After test driving an Infinity G35, VW Passat, and Mitsubishi, this was my last and final choice.  As soon as I got behind the wheel, I was hooked!  I've had this car for 2 years now and haven't regretted purchasing it once.  For a fun time, dependability, and unusual looks, check this one out.  People stop me all the time and ask about it; it's different from everything else on the road.  Go for the manual transmission... it's great fun!"
subaru,baja,2005,steve6153, 12/03/2006,LUV my Baja,5,I live in rural NY and needed a reliable light vehicle to get me in and out of area. My Baja has performed without a hitch since my purchase and dealer support has been great. Only issue is that dealer does not provide Saturday service. I have requested such without success. It is a good thing my Baja runs and runs and runs otherwise it might be an issue. I get frequent compliments on the look of vehicle and am often asked as to my level of satisfaction. My Baja came with the Bed Extender package so the small bed has not been a problem.
subaru,baja,2005,trakonus, 05/27/2004,Went from 4x4 pickup to Baja,4,"I purchased this truck about a month 
and a half ago, I wish it came out when 
I bought my dakota a few years ago.  It 
fit my needs perfectly.  It handles 
great and the upgraded sound system is 
great.  I would recommend this vehicle 
to anyone.  My neighbor used to be a 
mechanic for subarus up north, and he 
said as long as i use their oil filter 
and follow the maintenance log it will 
last a long long time."
subaru,baja,2005,chuckc, 06/30/2005,Baja truck/car,4,"I have about 13,000 on mine in 7 months and love it. I have the only one in my area, and I get compliments on its looks all the time. No problems with it yet, other than what sounds like minor belt rub, unlike my Mitsubishi Spyder which was a real piece of junk mechanically. My only complaint is what others have said, that the bed top is difficult to lift; needs a handle or something. Otherwise I really like it so far!"
subaru,baja,2005,Mial James Bryant, 09/04/2017,Biggest piece of garbage on the road,1,"The worse car I have ever had the turbo went out 3 times first time at only at 78, 000 cars are just breaking in. Air conditioner has gone out engine rebuilt at 100,000 and then the radiator blew at 100500 I would never buy a Subaru as long as I live even if it was a dollar and I would sell it if given to me .
"
subaru,baja,2005,bearbryant1, 03/15/2013,Worse Car I ever owned,1,"this has to be the worse car i ever owned. and would never purchase another Subaru ever again and would suggest that you never purchase one you would save more money on repairs if you got a mercies Benz or a BMW cause it will cost the same to repair. 
"
subaru,baja,2006,wot27, 01/05/2011,03 Baja 2.5 non turbo,5,"Being my 2nd Subaru, I am
glad this one isn't the SVX. I LOVE this one, its great in
the bends, a little on slow side w/out turbo but keeping rpm's up compensates fine for ""in the city"" driving if you feel the need. I have slight leak at 60k miles on my heads. As it seems to be known issue, I am displeased SOA has not done something to correct issue with
the customers. as long as I get too 100k ill do head gaskets, water pump and belt @ same time. till then just keeping the oil changed. "
subaru,baja,2006,Frankie, 09/17/2006,Dream car/truck,5,"Ever since the first ad came out for the Baja, I was hooked. I test drove the first models our Subaru dealership got and it was instant want. They handle beautifully, gets awesome gas mileage and has a wonderful sporty design. The comforts of a sedan with the utility of a truck. I had a 2000 Ford Focus before I got the Baja I have now, and when it started giving me problems, I wasted no time giving the dealership the keys and traded it for my very own, my first Subaru Baja. And I am happy I made the decision. This vehicle is certainly made for someone like me with the life style I have. Versatile and impressive. A well built machine for its day!"
subaru,baja,2006,DWL, 11/23/2006,Fun to drive,4,"It is not a high performance car but I knew that when I bought it.  It is peppy for its engine and body size.  It also handles curves really nice.  As for comfort, it is comfortable as I need and it gets good gas mileage considering I drive 78 miles everyday to and from work.  I am getting in the upper 26 to lower 27/mpg."
subaru,baja,2006,vince, 03/11/2010,defective,3,"love the car but there is a flaw with the head gaskets.  I'm leaking oil at 78,000 mi.  dealer wants 1500 to fix. seems I'm not alone, beware!"
subaru,baja,2006,Mike, 05/02/2010,Decent car but beware,4,"I've had our 2006 Baja for almost four years now.  While I do wish it was a Turbo (the car is too heavy for the engine to accelerate at a decent rate), it drives very well and is very predictable in bad weather and conditions.  The styling is pretty cool, and the AWD is great when it snows. However, my engine has a head gasket leak.  Yep, at 70,000 miles - both heads are leaking oil.  It's not a huge issue right now, as the leak is very minor, but still the dealer wants $1500 for it.  Same price as the other guy - I wonder if we have the same dealer?  Who knows, but it's still annoying and therefore I will not recommend Subaru to anyone until I know that this issue is resolved.  "
subaru,baja,2006,bpeebles, 01/30/2010,Fun Little Truck,4,"When I was looking to replace my V8 Dodge Dakota, checked every dealership within 50 miles. Nothing really caught my eye. I really wanted something that would be more like my 1981 Volkswagen Rabbit Pickup (size-wise)  This is my 1st Subaru and I was kind of apprehensive. But, after less than a year, I am wondering why I have not owned a Subaru before. In the snow, this thing handles very predictably.  The turbo offers the very best of both worlds... 4cylinder economy most of the time with the kick in the rear of a 6cylinder when you want it. The first time I pinned my wife to the seat accelerating onto the interstate was pure pleasure. (for me,anyway)"
subaru,baja,2006,Manny, 07/31/2005,Subaru Baja 2005,4,"Enough power for a stock drivetrain. Good on gas (hwy). About 400 miles to the tank. Could be a little more comfortable, but the car is equipped nicely."
subaru,baja,2006,bluebaja, 02/10/2009,Build these again!!,5,"When our 03 Baja was getting high miles, there was only 1 choice to replace it - another Baja! We found our 06 6 hours from our home still under factory warranty. The only complaint I have about the Baja is SOA didn't keep making them based on the new Outback.  Comfortable, capable off road, great in the snow - what more could anyone want from a daily driver?  If you don't need the towing capacity of a full size truck and still want decent gas mileage with a truck bed (plywood and drywall as well as dimensional lumber fits), the Baja is your vehicle!  If SOA had advertised them, they would have sold like hot cakes. 3 people bought 1 after seeing our 03."
subaru,baja,2006,Russ, 08/19/2006,Chick Magnet,4,"This useful little truck is a great conversation piece and says a lot about me and the things I do. If you need a big truck, buy a big truck. If you need a fast car, buy a fast car. If you need some of both, but only have room in your driveway for one, get the Baja. It pwns. "
subaru,baja,2006,workb4play, 12/31/2006,Small Commuter Truck,4,"I bought this Baja Sport as an economical alternative to my RAM 2500 Diesel for a round trip commute of 70 miles. Being only 5'9"" and 180#, this vehicle seems harder to get in the driver's seat than any I have ever owned.  It also lacks the power of any previous vehicles. But, I did not buy for power and once you are in the driver's seat, this is one of the most enjoyable cars I have ever owned. It has a sports car ride and feel.  Interior finish sets the standard for its competitors.  Base vinyl/fabric seats are supportive, top quality, and everyone thinks it is leather. Door panels are equally impressive. Engine is very quiet. Transmission shifts smooth but downshifts at the slightest hill."
subaru,baja,2006,AWD Only, 05/03/2006,Our 2nd Baja,4,"Yes it may be an odd looking vehicle to many people, but there's no denying the utility it provides.  Add in the security of Subaru's AWD system and reliability and you have a winning combination."
subaru,baja,2006,John, 10/14/2018,Amazingly useful little vehicle (06 turbo 5-speed),5,"First of all, to correct edDUMBS... the '06 did greatly change.  It has about 10"" clearance, and 236 HP out of the ej255 engine (same as the OB XT and the Legacy GT and the Forester XT of the same year and later).  They also never came with tonneaus (buy separately)  or heated seats.  Do your research, author...  Anyway, this is a great little car-truck.  It handles like the sportier WRX by Subaru and most of the time I forget it's also a truck.  With the bed extender you have 5"" of bed.  With the gate down, you have plenty of places to tie large objects down to.  I've moved two couches at the same time, multiple refrigerators, a massive wall unit, and even a 200cc dirt bike.  It's a truck and don't let anyone tell you the bed size is too small or useless.  Overall great reliability, easily fast enough for mountain driving, great in the snow, and it feels like a tank compared to other Subarus.  I even got lucky enough to find a used one with an ARE camper shell for the bed.
"
subaru,baja,2006,Jason, 07/01/2008,Silver Bullet,4,"I love driving my '06 Baja Turbo! It accelerates quickly and performs very well. I have hauled a big freezer, a washer & dryer set (whole set at once!), even hauled a riding mower home from Sears. The mower barely fit, but due to the width of the Baja's bed I was able to accomodate it. It's awesome in the snow and mud and I have yet to get it stuck. The Baja comes well equipped with an impressive list of standard equipment.  I love driving my Baja!"
subaru,baja,2006,HaveFunWithIt, 01/12/2006,Practical but slow,3,"I am really getting attached to the Baja.  It's fun to drive because of its accurate steering and light weight.  There is a lot of aluminum on this vehicle (motor heads and block, tranny, differential cover, etc).  The bed looks really small, but I fit a full sized dirt bike in it (300cc) with gear bag and tool box.  No one believes that it will fit until they see it.  And that is WITHOUT folding down the pass through door to the cab.  The Baja is the slowest car I have ever driven, though.  I have an Isuzu pickup with 2.6L 4 cylinder motor (Baja 2.5L 4 cylinder) with 225k miles on it that is 3 times quicker.  And I always considered the Isuzu to be slow.  I am not exaggerating one bit about this."
subaru,baja,2006,oscar, 11/05/2006,good car,4,"I sell Hondas, so you can imagine what kind of buyer I am. The Subaru is for my wife (yes I could not sell her a Honda). Anyways the car is great - she loves it, the only thing they need to improve is the pick up from 0 to 60 for the auto transmission, it's a little bit sluggish. Also a gas guzzler considering is a small car; we get 18.5 miles to gallon on city with light traffic. That is what I get in my V-6 Isuzu Rodeo 4x4, then again you have to consider that the Baja is an all wheel drive.  Overall I'll give a 9.5."
subaru,baja,2006,Bill, 01/09/2007,Great All Around Vehicle!,4,Just purchased one of the remaining 2006 leather turbo models. I had to travel out of state to get it but it was well worth the trip. It accelerates and handles great. I traded in a 2004 VW Touareg V8 and do not regret my decision whatsoever. It is much funner to drive than the Touareg and is just as comfortable in my opinion. The only complaint with the Baja is its sub standard stereo and the fact that no navigation system or satellite radio is offered. I have already replaced the entire system and have installed an in dash navigation/stereo.
subaru,baja,2006,Mike, 04/09/2007,Fun,4,"I wanted new car or pick-up truck, and I was undecided, untill 2006 Subaru Baja. It is everything that I wanted! Drives like a car, and I can pick-up some furniture or other items without paying for deliveries. It is a little bit sluggish, however I was supprised at fuel economy. I am getting around 27 mpg with mixed driving. All I need is cargo cover so I can pick-up kids and go grocery shopping when raining."
subaru,baja,2006,Defo, 03/28/2008,Consolation prize,4,"$100 a week on fuel was reason enough to sell my Frontier and acquire a used Baja. I'd trade-off the loss of a little pickup and a 6' bed for the all wheel drive/better handling, great standard features (fog lights, power moonroof, ski rack, bed extender, etc.) to save 30% on the gas bill any day! This vehicle is a great downsizing option. Subaru may want to re-think their decision to stop making them before a competitor does."
subaru,baja,2006,Paul, 06/28/2006,fun to cruise,4,"The Baja picks up and zings with the turbo engine. The power seats are most impressive of any vehicle I have driven. Quick to accelerate, Fun to look at, and great handling makes the Baja a must have for outdoor enthusiasts who like the versatility, but want to avoid the motion-sickness of a bumpy ride of a pickup. "
subaru,baja,2006,Chris, 03/01/2007,Keep it away from the dealership!,2,I bought this Baja to save gas over my Chev full size pick-up. WRONG MOVE. At first it got really great mileage (almost 30 mpg on hwy) but then I took it to the dealer for its first oil change. BIG BIG MISTAKE. After that day it starting getting 17 mpg in town and 20 mpg on hwy. I took it back to the dealer (02/07) and the mechanic said no codes showed bad and therefore he couldn't work on the vehicle. The dealer offered me $18k trade in for a new Chevy truck and I guess that's about the best I can expect to get. Such a great concept vehicle but I can see now why Subaru never sold very many of them. Why drive a tiny truck if it uses as much fuel as a comfortable one? Save your money!
subaru,baja,2006,tcatbaja, 09/23/2005,"Very practical ""truck""",4,"I came from a Tundra looking for something smaller.  Was all set on a Tacoma, but tried a Baja and loved it.  Very solid ride, ""almost"" like an RX7 I used to own.  Perfect for hauling small stuff.  21-29 mileage is a stretch; my first tank was 18.3, all city driving, but still much better than the 13-14 I got with the Tundra.  I got the Royal Blue metallic, which gets dirty quick. I'd probably get silver if I had it to do again."
subaru,baja,2006,Starr, 05/27/2006,Roo,4,"I bought my (turbo) Baja in order to combine my truck and car needs into one vehicle.  It handles ever bit as good as my Mustang and is a lot of fun to drive, costing me about the same in gas. The fold down back seat belongs to my Shar-Pei, and when he's not aboard it's perfect for all my shopping needs.  The locking bed is even better than any trunk I have ever had. It turns heads while I'm out and about and there is no lack of power, surprising many. It has perfect lines and the leather interior is the perfect touch for the near perfect vehicle which I call the ""lady's pick up"" as it's petite, sleek, fashionable and truly the best purchase I have ever made."
subaru,baja,2006,Kevin, 12/06/2006,Best of all worlds,4,"Ride of a sedan, most of the functionality of a small truck, handles great.  The engine is just as smooth as my partner's RX8.  I had a 2002 Mazda B2300 before this, and after driving the Baja, I couldn't bear to get back in it. The difference in the refinement is like night and day.  Just had my first bit of bad winter weather, and didn't slide once.  This may be my first and only Baja if they stop production, but I'm sold on Subaru for life."
subaru,baja,2006,ted13, 06/28/2007,"May be a niche market, but one I'm in!",4,"I absolutely love my Baja!  Fantastic handling, comfort, and style with more than enough room for cargo for me.  I do wish the gas mileage was a bit better, though."
subaru,baja,2006,kim, 10/28/2007,My favorite car,4,"A truck doesn't compare.  A car doesn't compare.  This is the best of both worlds.

I drive many cars every day, this one got my attention. No mechanical problems whatsoever. Great powerband, very torquey. Steering positive and responsive. I haven't had much snow around here, but when there is the car has no problem sensing traction loss.

subaru,impreza-wrx,2013,leob1, 02/26/2014,2013 WRX Hatchback,4,"This is a very practical, fun, AWD performance car with outstanding value for the money. A 0-60 time of 4.7 and ability to surpass 60 easily in second gear gives lots of confidence merging into traffic. The whine of the turbo is intoxicating combined with the rumble of the flat four boxer engine. It is super practical with the hatchback and can accommodate large items easily (seats fold down); big screen TV's, large boxes, mountain bike, etc. The hatch also works as excellent rain protection when you are loading (unexpected surprise). The AWD is incredible for inclement weather, but be sure to get at least all season tires so you can stop and turn in easier in snow (had stock summer tires). "
subaru,impreza-wrx,2013,aggarcia, 02/07/2013,2013 STI Limited,4,"Most hard core performance buyers are not looking at Edmunds, but I did not like several things they said in their review. In the performance category, not much besides a supercar offers as much performance for the dollar than the STI. The AWD, SI Drive, and adjustable differentials, and 6 speed transmission are world class. The interior uses cheaper materials, but this is based in the Impreza platform. You buy a STI for the performance not to impress any one. Right now Subaru has a 4 month waiting period to get a STI or WRX, so someone must be wanting them. 

I enjoy everyday I hop into my STI and get to make going places and experience. The factroy NAV/SAt system sounds pretty good to me. "
subaru,impreza-wrx,2013,lucas14, 02/23/2013,Subaru Sti,4,"The Subaru WRX Sti limited was about what I expected.
I bought the care to be my daily driver.
It is very fun to drive and more comfortable than I would have expected.
Paying the extra money for the limited package was well worth it.
Heated seats adds some extra comfort in the winter time, and the sunroof will be nice in the summer.
I'm not impressed with the stereo system, but I can easily be remedied with some aftermarket additions. "
subaru,impreza-wrx,2013,ejhara, 10/05/2013,great value in sport compact,5,"Fine car, starting with styling. Has functional hood scoop and side vents for cooling turbo and brakes. 360 tour takes you by four doors and nice spoiler plus four exhaust tips. Subarus tend to be durable (I've had five). AWD and hill-holder on manual shift are great features. Secure-feeling, nicely-handling car, even when you are not putting your foot into the throttle. When you do that, hang on! Great power for a 2.5 liter. 
Update: Still a headturner. Good power at any rpm. Odd rattles. WR blue ages well. Door gasket keeps fraying. Gas filler door hard to open. Puzzling deficiencies like these, but still love the car. (22k mi.)
Update #2: 40k miles/5 years old. Car still looks good and is a head-turner, especially to those who have watched the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. Car remains mechanically very good. Appearance is excellent. I use Klasse AIO ""wax,"" and keep car garaged and covered much of the time. I've had two sets of A-pillar rattles fixed at dealer, and passenger-side window motor is very weak, and soon to be replaced. Airbag issue affects this car. With snows, the car is fine in the winter, but it remains a little low to ride over drifting snow. Replaced battery at 32k. Due to my inattention, I curbed a factory wheel. Had it fixed, but it cost me $250. I would buy this car again--maybe at 50k miles on my current one--but Subaru is making strange noises about dropping a manual shift, which would dissuade me from getting another. Since I live in Michigan, I'm going to inspect car for underbody corrosion soon. There is no visible exterior rust. Car is a blast on trips: Somehow, I never worry about passing on a two-lane road, as the 2.5 turbo blows you right past anyone. I like the WR blue, and my current plan is to buy the same car, same color, and not the STI (too much $ for not that much of an upgrade).
Here is an October, 2018 review update: I only have 33k miles (after 5 and 1/2 years) on the car presently (apparently I made an erroneous mileage estimate last review); I have no mods on the car. But I do have regular maintenance: every 3500 miles new synthetic oil, and went through the expensive dealer-suggested maintenance at 30k. (Why do I need oil and gas cleaner/additive from dealer at this maintenance if I use Shell premium and Amsoil oil at 3750 mile changes? I think I know.) Car runs great and looks excellent. The World Rally Blue has lasted quite well, and is an attention-getter. I would buy the same color again. One complaint is that the exhaust (cat back, factory) has corroded noticeably. No holes, but it looks bad. (I have a 2012 Equinox, driven at same place, same conditions, etc., whose exhaust system still looks new.) I was not intending to get an aftermarket exhaust, but if I keep the car, I will, just for the appearance factor. I have sprayed the backs of the two mufflers (visible under bumper) with high-temp Rustoleum, and that improved looks from the back dramatically. I have had the passenger-side window motor replaced, and several door gaskets. (They have worn by regular use.) Mechanically, car is great. Car's interior is a bit tight when the driver is wearing down jacket. Car's lights are great. I miss having Sirius radio, and a six-speed would be nice instead of my five-speed. I'm starting to get ""buy"" requests from people, largely because of appearance of car (new) and that I have not made any performance mods to it. If I do sell it, I would get another, or possibly a left-over Forester XT. I suppose I have one nagging question at this point: Why did Subaru turn out an exhaust that won't tolerate northern Michigan winters without corroding badly? Shouldn't they test an AWD car in extreme northern conditions, including road salt? Wouldn't using an exhaust with appearance longevity be showing ""Love"" for their customers? I really like my Subaru dealership mechanic (Mike) who knows WRX's inside
 and out, primarily because he drives one.

subaru,impreza-wrx,2013,ejhara, 05/28/2014,Up North Performance Car,5,"If you want an awd performance car for year-round use in snowy climates--one that is affordable--this is one of few out there. Just returned from a 1000 mile trip: close to 30 mpg, with no particular gas-saving driving. Always power easily available; handling is quite quick and good. Premium package an attractive choice: can't beat a sunroof, and the short-throw shifter seems desirable. WR blue is a great color. Spoiler gets in the way sometimes as far as backing up, but it looks better than STI version. One negative: exhaust noise/rumble. (I had 2007 Forester turbo, which had a more-pleasant sound.) 20 somethings love this car: Fast and Furious influence. Hill holder good. Good purchase!

Update at 30,000 miles: Still have the same car, and have an extended warranty. Car has had two nasty rattles: one in A pillar, driver's side, and one in engine compartment. The second was an engine/mounting bolt, diagnosed at dealer (good mechanic, Mike) and fixed. The first (pillar) appears in owners' forums. Again, diagnosed and fixed by Mike. I've always heard that Subaru spends its money on drive train, not comfort, looks, or electronics, and I agree. Radio is kind of tinny, and lots of plastic inside. But, the engine is solid and powerful, with quick acceleration available at any rpm. Shifter works fine, and winter driving (with proper tires) is safe. AWD is unobtrusive. Mileage on last trip was about 27 on premium. WR blue is a great color, and looks fine when car is shined up, which is often. Drove a new STI recently, and its ride is 25% firmer. Also, its brakes seemed noticeable: firmer, surer, and from what I understand, much more expensive to replace. My next car could be the same level of WRX, an XT Forester (only available in automatic), or I might make the jump to an STI. Up North, it's easy to see why this make of car is popular. It is great to be able to manually shift gears. Two quick gripes: No ""bra"" available from Subaru for this model, and car only comes with summer tires (odd). Lastly, I've had no oil use problem. I'm happy to jump in this car and go anywhere.

Update 2019: Just traded in the 2013 WRX. It still looks and runs great. Only 35 k miles, though, and no modifications to the car. Bought essentially the same car at trade-in: 2019 WRX premium package, in white. Looks great with the black wheels that are standard. New car is very similar in performance. Maybe the seats are a bit more comfortable (and they are the standard seats, not Recaro). Very noticeable is the current dashboard: Many more features (e.g., turbo boost gauge standard), back-up camera, etc. Low-end torque might be improved, but I'm still in break-in period. Sixth gear addition is nice. Rattles, at this time, are nonexistent. Still comes with summer tires, which will have to be switched out in the fall in Michigan. I'll add a further evaluation of this car in a couple of months, under 2019 WRX. The car is a great value if you like to drive.

subaru,impreza-wrx,2013,Gary, 07/05/2019,Fun with your rocket,4,"Have a 2013, one of the last wagons in WRX, with COBB cat back system, and STI short throw shifter.  The $600 shifter worth every penny.  Now with 50,000 mi, would not hesitate to get another except Subaru does not make this care here any more.  I love the wagon.  This car has limited interior bling, rather plain I would say.  Car not impressive until you turn it on.....OMG this thing will show the rally heritage as soon as you put into gear.  Have done trips through remote areas of the US west, and can attest to the raw power of the turbo, I have never had over 135, but gets there VERY quickly.  The handling is exceptional, and with the AWD you POWER out of corners.  Have taken on very expensive (read that M5) BMW's in the Ruby mtn of Nevada, had to stop and wait for them.  Impressive as it is in pavement, just wait till you have this machine in the snow.  Traction control works, but even more fun when you turn it off.  I hope to get another 50,000 miles, and hope that Subaru will bring back the wagon in the WRX or STI.

subaru,impreza-wrx,2014,bnewton_xp, 11/14/2013,Last of it's kind,4,"After owning a 2007 STI, I consider the 2014 STI a great improvement. Much improved seats and lower road noise over 2007 STI. 2014 STI is a bit more refined than 2007 STI, however the 2007 STI car was a bit more raw and in-your-face. 

I chose the hatchback over the sedan as it offers the best of both worlds in performance and utility. Plus the hatchback does not appear to draw as much attention as the sedan with the big wing. 

While I could've waited for the new 2015 STI,
but with the next STI/WRX being more road focus I felt like the next car would lose little bit of it's rally heritage and that what makes STI unique."
subaru,impreza-wrx,2014,hookshot, 08/22/2014,Good car but not great,4,"I got the 2014 hatchback STI in white.

Engine: strong mid-range power, but weak top end.
Some turbo lag, power comes on around 3k rims and dies off around 5.5k rpm.
Redline at 7k.
Fuel economy is poor even in intelligent mode which saps the power.
I avg 22 mpg and I mainly drive like a grandma.
Expect 18 mpg avg if you have heavy foot.

Exterior: what can I say it looks aggressive.
I swapped the gun metals for gold bbs and it looks good.
Custom molded the base impreza mud flaps to fit.
Looks great.

the stock Bluetooth sucks.

subaru,tribeca,2008,Briofny, 07/23/2009,Did not meet expecations,3,"I purchased the car in April of 08, and just hit 27k miles. Small gas tank, but mileage not bad for an SUV. The fit of the interior of the car is disappointing, loose pieces every where, & the rear hatch is not designed to strategically close when packing. Also, what is the point of the rear blower if I can't control it from the front, my kids cant reach it. The look of the car is great, but I can't justify the looks versus the quality I expect for the prices.  A+ on the handling and engine (although Subaru wants me to change the tranny fluid already)! C on interior quality and pointing out as another post did, who scans on the radio any more, let me change my presets from the steering wheel"

What we do have issues with is the interior coming apart,like the plastic behind the steering wheel decided it didn't want to stay clipped. As for the 7 passenger claim..mm maybe they should have called it a 51/2 passenger. an adult can fit if they sit sideways. For the drive quality my wife has beaten out many a sport car with it. Fuel economy we average 21.5-25 mpg hwy (no kidding) when we take it to the mountains for ski season otherwise the posted 16 mpg city is accurate not bad for an SUV.

I was shopping for an SUV w/ 4WD/AWD, good reliability and resale, and wanted some luxury appointments (leather, 6 CD, etc) for not much over $30k.  I chose the Subaru over all others in class as I was able to get most everything I wanted without having to compromise too much.  The inside and exterior styling are very unique, and the interior is more luxurious and sharp looking that the other cars in class. I've had the car for close to a year and have been very impressed.  The AWD system is fantastic in the Iowa winters.  After having ridden in all of them, I'm happy I chose this over Pilot, Highlander, 4Runner and Edge."

LIKES:
purchase price including factory incentives was $6,000 under MSRP.

It has plenty of nice standard features.

I like the styling (except the Chrysler-like grill).
I really like the size and cargo capacity with the seats folded.

DISLIKES: fuel economy, small fuel tank, cheap and non-durable plastic cargo area material, forward blind spots caused by thick posts.

I was swayed by the features I didn't have in the Highlander like heated seats, memory  seats, outside temp reading, etc. The insurance is a fortune-my bad for not checking.

subaru,tribeca,2008,No more Subaru, 08/01/2017,No More Subaru!!!,2,"From beginning of owning the car we noticed the engine noise like from broken muffler. Then noticed the engine oil level drops when it is still a new car.  Lynns Subaru dealer did not do any thing to address the problems. I was told it is normal for Tribeca.  Later I have to add oil between regular oil changes. As car gets old it requires more frequent additions of oil especially after a long drive.  The tail pipes got black burned oil deposits.  Many times asked dealer Victory Subaru to fix the oil burning they told me nothing wrong.  There were many mechanical and electrical problems that will take too much time to detail them.  Following is the short list: driver side window detached from rolling mechanism, power steering failed while driving, car has to be towed, radiators hose bursts leaking coolant, car towed. Cruise control never worked due to a number of engine warning signs pop up intermittently.   All these problems were told to Victory Subaru dealer and they are incapable to fix them, instead they made us to change CV Boots and Booshings well before they life time and charged us almost $ 4000.  The car was made in Mexico.  The problems we had are more than manufacturer poor quality control, It was from design faults.  This is Our second Subaru, We simply had enough problems and irresponsible dealer services and going to sell it below market and no more Subaru for us and our friends, coworkers, neighbors, I will let anyone know about how bad the Subaru becomes.  Subaru lies about its reliability.

The Tribeca is a hidden gem, it has a great ride and all the features of a Lexus RX but costs $12,000 less. While the critics complain about lack of space in rear rows that only applies to the 7 seater, the 5 seater has plenty of leg room. I think Subaru should stop trying to market the Tribeca as a 7 seater. Mileage could be better, but it helps that the Tribeca runs on regular gas. Handling is good enough that I don't miss the Audi. The overall ride is quiet, smooth and feels very sophisticated. The stereo is very good and helps make the commute highly enjoyable. The nav system has worked fine for me thus far. "
subaru,tribeca,2008,Sonny, 12/14/2009,Pleased,4,"This vehicle has just been fantastic. I love the handling, and since the 30,000 mile service I love it even better. Subaru has taken exceptional care of this vehicle and at 34,000, I will be extending the warranty, until they make a 6-speed tranny, then I'll move up to that model."
subaru,tribeca,2008,Claire T., 09/15/2010,A Little over 2 years old,4,This car has more than enough power. Handles well under all weather conditions.
subaru,tribeca,2008,Mike9743, 10/12/2007,Great Crossover,5,Great all around vehicle; it does OK on gas; it looks and drives fantastic... best large vehicle I've ever owned.
subaru,tribeca,2008,gmopsman, 09/04/2007,Great vehicle,5,The vehicle has good power and does not have to shift down to pull hills. I averaged approximately 23 miles per gallon on the trip from Virginia to Tennessee at speeds from 55 to 75. The seats are supportive. The navigation system needs street number and address info before it will initiate. Good information display. Some people might like more adjustment in the steering wheel position. So far it has been very good.
subaru,tribeca,2008,David in Austin, 10/30/2007,Love my new Tribeca,4,"I just purchased this vehicle this weekend, and absolutely love it.  The ride and handling is great and the AWD system inspires confidence.  Nav system is easy to use, but is a little far away.  The redesign provides more rear seat room, and with the 7 passenger, you get rear AC controls that help a great deal.  Handling is very precise and acceleration with the nex 3.6 liter engine is much better than in the previous generation."
subaru,tribeca,2008,bgk, 10/29/2007,Why I bought the 2008 Tribeca,4,"After talking to persons who own a Subaru I knew they were onto something. I 'test drove' a few friends who own them and could feel the solidness of the vehicle. Since I don't buy new cars every few years (previously drove a '97 Blazer) I wanted to make sure this was the  car for me. It is. Reading the reports on  Subaru's reliability also moved me into purchasing it. Size wise, it's perfect.  Not too big or small.   Driving the Tribeca one can feel the responsiveness of it. A good, linear feel, like you are on rails, plus  great stopping power. Good road feel too. Not too soft or harsh. Like Goldilocks' porridge, just right! Plus quick acceleration when stomped on."
subaru,tribeca,2008,sunflwr50, 10/26/2007,Wonderful Vehicle,4,"After researching the typical makes of SUVs I decided on the Tribeca. It is fun to drive, handles well & looks sporty. The interior controls are easy to use especially at night due to the red backlighting. The stability control is awesome. I feel it is the only thing that kept me on the road when I was hydroplaning in a bad rain storm. You can actually feel the system work as it steers you in the right direction. The ride is very smooth and quiet."
subaru,tribeca,2008,APM, 11/22/2007,"A great vehicle, but don't get the nav",4,"This is my 4th Subaru. They are a very reliable car, and great in winter weather. The fit and finish of the car is superb. The interior is quite roomy both front and rear, and I like the styling. I looked at BMW and Lexus, and I bought the Subaru. To my taste, the exterior looks just like every other crossover. It's nice, but not distinctive. The interior has high style and comfort. It handles very well, and has just the right amount of power. Braking is spectacular. I am not comfortable with the way the transmission shifts, particularly on hills. "
subaru,tribeca,2008,Pepe_V, 12/06/2007,Great value in a crossover,4,"I've driven nearly 3,000 miles on my new Tribeca.  I previously drove a Cadillac STS, and wanted a comfortable, sporty ride, that didn't require me to sit so low to the ground.  My Tribeca is very comfortable, sporty (for this kind of vehicle), and versatile with the room in back and fold down seats.  The nav system is inconsistent - sometimes it's great, others, like a trip to central OH last week, it wants to send you 100 miles out of your way.  Gas mileage could be better. The 2008 model is good looking, with a smooth engine and terrific all wheel drive at a nice price. It also has lots of storage, cup holders and power ports for family use. Put this on your short list!   "
subaru,tribeca,2008,C. J. DeSantis, 12/11/2007,Hard to Beat,4,"I backed into the Subaru Tribeca because the Acura Dealers were not willing to negotiate on the RDX.  That caused me to research more and I found the Tribeca with a six cylinder engine instead of a turbocharged 4 cylinder and I never looked back.  I've now had the car 3 months and I am very happy the Acura dealers were shortsighted.  The Tribeca is the most fun to drive of any car I have ever owned and I've owned quite a few.  It corners and holds the road like a sports car.  The ""toys"" radio, gps, sound sys are excellent.  The backup camera is great, especially at night.  Mileage is average, in the 18 to 20 range.  The one shortcoming is the gas tank.  It should have greater capacity."
subaru,tribeca,2008,J H, 08/09/2020,"Review after 12 years, 180K miles",2,"Good:  Wife loves the look.  Cargo area holds a lot.
Not so good:  Third row seating isn't too useful except for very small passengers.  Poor mileage.  Headlights difficult to replace due to tight space.  Struts are ruined by Alaska cold, or might be crappy everywhere, not sure.
Terrible:  Has gobbled oil the last 40K miles, engine could go at any time.  Know another owner whose engine failed at 150K total.  Dual exhaust is a pointless design for a vehicle without much power, and very expensive to replace after failure of catalytic converter and other emissions components about 20K miles back, so don't bring this vehicle to a city where there is an emissions test.  The poor front struts have led to multiple front brake replacements and killed the headlights typically within one year.  Replacing the struts didn't even help.  This is a lemon but my wife loves it and scolds me for talking badly to it and about it"
subaru,tribeca,2008,Joe, 01/17/2017,My Tribeca,5,"Great handling and superior forward vision. Very nice ride.
"
subaru,tribeca,2008,seriously5, 09/26/2014,2008 Suburu Nightmare,3,"I was impressed that this SUV had everything my Acura MDX had before it died. I got it used 5 mos. ago with 75K miles on it.  The a/c died 3 weeks after buying it.  The pocket behind my driver's seat ripped in 4 weeks following that. Neither was covered by the extended warranty I bought.  Fuel door wouldn't open yesterday, and my gas light was on.  Scheduled to get it fixed this Sat.  Now my passenger door won't open with the remote or the button inside.  Great.  Gas mileage range is 17-21, but I haven't seen above 19."
subaru,tribeca,2008,Nor Cal, 10/29/2008,2008 Subaru Tribeca Review,4,"I have had the Tribeca since April 2008 and put almost 6000 miles on it so far. The handling of the AWD Tribeca is darn near neutral and the turn in spot on. its fun to drive and comfortable on road trips or in town. The interior and exterior looks compliment each other. I use the transmission in sport mode all the time, either leaving it in drive or shifting up and down. the engine is a lot more responsive & mileage doesn't seem to suffer. One thing that bugs me is that the transmission shifting seems out of sync with the engine at times. The Tribeca doubles well as a tent and carries a lot of ""stuff"". I don't like the puddle lights though but that's a nil point IMO. Next thing is XM radio."
subaru,tribeca,2008,Phil in Blaine, 01/22/2009,Loss of confidence,3,"I purchased our Tribeca about 18 months ago, and rated it very high. All of that has changed after being stranded 3 times and numerous trips to the dealer who can't or won't resolve the problems. From the beginning there has been a noise in the engine that the dealer and factory reps hear but can't pinpoint, so it goes unrepaired, also it burns oil but not enough to meet their oil consumption criteria. The steering column locks up, and has stranded us three times, you have to beat and bang on the column to unlock it, the tow driver taught me that, and because you can't duplicate the condition, they can't repair it. This is our first Subaru and it will be our last. Maybe we got a LEMON?"
subaru,tribeca,2008,Overland Park, KS,Energy Drain,4,"I love everything about this car - except two issues that I've had.  I have a ""phantom"" energy drain that leaves me stranded due to a dead battery.  It's random, unpredictable and frustrating.  I also have had to have the power steering fixed twice - they actually needed to put a new pump (?), regardless, at such low mileage I'm surprised."
subaru,tribeca,2008,1rich, 01/18/2011,Junk,1,"I did a lot of research when the '08 model came out.
Unfortunately there was not enough real data out there.
Reliability and performance are poor.
We get 14.5 miles per gallon in mixed driving.
Full size SUV's with V8 engines can do better.
Besides the gas useage is the oil useage.
Check it out on your own.
Subara considers 1 quart of oil used per every 1000 miles within spec.
I should know.
This is our Tribeca's oil consumption.
We have had interior components fall off (Visors, seat backs, seat track covers, etc.)
The dash squeaks, the hatch rattles and
engine components have failed (EGR valve).
All this and less than 25k miles on it.
I will never own another subaru."
subaru,tribeca,2008,Rich, 06/06/2008,Glad we did,4,"We were coming up on the lease of our Sienna. We looked at several crossovers: Acadia, Edge, Murano, Pilot, CX9, Highlander. My wife had a Subie when we first met, and she asked to look at the new one. We drove all the others, and we drove this and said, ""Yes."" This a fun car to drive, room for kids and cargo, AWD, and we like the design. We got the gold color with tan leather. Even in the sun all day, it doesn't get that hot inside. Got it on a 42 mo lease, and we are very happy. Getting 17mpg mixed driving, but the engine only has 600 miles. Better mileage to come when fully broken in."
subaru,tribeca,2008,Jay, 06/25/2008,Traded my Acura TL,4,"Leased this vehicle in April 2008.Love the comfortable smooth ride. It has a lot of room for sports equipment. XM radio is awesome. Fun to drive and with AWD handles great on rain slicked roads. Will be going up to the western NC mountains next month and am looking forward to mountain driving. Looked and test drove Mazda CX-9, Buick Enclave, GMC Acadia, Acura MDX, and Toyota Highlander. The Subaru Tribeca seemed to be the best fit and great value for the money."
subaru,tribeca,2008,Happy in Ohio, 08/04/2008,Second Subaru,4,"This is our 2nd Subaru and we couldn't be happier. Our first was a 2003 Forester, which is still running strong and soon to become the kids car. You just can't beat Subaru when it comes to safety and dealing with snow, rain, or ice. Oh yeah almost forgot they are also fun to drive. People at work are almost always surprised to hear that our Tribeca is a Subaru. The exterior is as nice and the interior nicer then the couple Acura MDXs I park beside everyday at work. The best part thanks to the price we can still afford to take ours on a road trip when we feel like it. We are just starting to look for my wife a new car and the 2009 Forester is looking like the front runner."
subaru,tribeca,2008,Scott, 10/03/2008,Good Value,4,"Have had the basic 5 person version for several months. We researched literally ever vehicle except this one, but drove it because dealership also had them. What a great car for the $$. Liked most everything from the start and the concerns (the cockpit design) have grown on us. If it is good in snow as its supposed to be then it will be a ""10"""
subaru,tribeca,2008,Disappointed, 12/24/2007,Shop Carefully,2,"Rear-seat riders in 7-passenger model should not be taller than 2 feet. Check leg room carefully. Ceiling mounted seat belt for middle seat, middle row, hits rider to the right in the head. Gas mileage is terrible. Repeat, gas mileage is terrible. Nav screen darkens way too much when headlights turned on. Gas mileage is terrible. Keyless remote unreliable. If you lock car using key, also unlock with key or alarm will sound. Gas mileage is terrible. CD changer repeats same CD, doesn't change to another CD. Must be done manually. Middle seats uncomfortable."
subaru,tribeca,2008,KRB, 01/16/2008,Nice enjoyable vehicle,4,"Tribeca is a fun car to drive. Instrument panel is cool looking and easy to read. Like the interior design. Front seats feel like a ""cockpit"" not just the front seat of a car. It's tighter on space than other comparable SUVs. Only other negative is that mileage is disappointing. We're getting just over 15mpg all city/local driving. "
subaru,tribeca,2008,Impressed, 01/18/2008,Another First Time Subaru owner,4,"Like another reviewer, wife's car, was driving an STS.Did all the comparisons of driving and reading reviews plus watched a bunch of comparison videos. Nothing comes close to the performance,handling or safety. Compared to the B9 it is a much improved vehicle. If anyone is looking to buy an SUV because of weather considerations, this car will be one of the last to lose integrity.Great AWD and Traction control that really work."
subaru,tribeca,2008,Bob, 01/23/2008,2008 Tribeca a big improvement,4,"Have had the Tribeca for 5 months and 6,000 miles.  Combination driving I am averaging 19.5 miles.  In city - 17 to 18 which is as advertised.  Highway only trips 22 - 24.  We have had a Land Rover Discovery, Acura MDX, Mercedes ML 320 and Volvo XC70 - this vehicle is every bit as good and much less expensive.  Because of those other SUVs I was smart enough to not get the built in Navi.  Spent $250 on a Garmin.  Almost bought BMW X5 but decided to save $20K - glad I did."
subaru,tribeca,2008,gvo, 07/31/2007,Great luxury bang for the buck,4,"'08 Tribeca is head and shoulders above the underpowered '07 model with ugly front looks. The drive is smooth, the design and build quality are great. It's a hungry beast, though - I can't get more than 17 mpg out of it. Other than that, beautiful car, and I am very happy with it."
subaru,tribeca,2008,Phil in Blaine, 09/11/2007,Great Vehicle,5,"After looking at and driving all the other SUVs in its class and some above it, this by far was the best vehicle. If you are in the market for this type of vehicle you owe to yourself to take a test drive, you will be sold. The mileage surprised me. I am getting 18.5 to 19 mpg in suburban driving. It is quiet, smooth and has one of the smoothest shifting transmissions I have driven, almost as smooth as a CVT. The power curve is excellent. Subaru has hit a home run with this vehicle."
subaru,tribeca,2008,RoadStar, 11/03/2007,Exceeded my Importation,4,"My first import, wanted something that was not mainstream and found it! A real looker, have many positive compliments on it and especially since Subaru is has a history of not being attractive/sexy cars. Rides like a heavy SUV but with a soft suspension. Pulls my 18' I/O runabout boat with surprising ease. Corners very well and has solid brakes. So far able to pull out 260ish miles on a tank of 87 octane. And that is with the help of my ""lead"" foot. Base stereo should offer at least 6 disk in dash for this class of car."
subaru,tribeca,2008,BernieKl, 11/20/2007,"Liked it so much, I bought two",4,"Live in Cleveland Ohio where winters are harsh and streets are not well maintained. Test drove the Tribeca and my wife and I loved the performance, comfort, and style of the Tribeca. Traded in two full size SUVs for two Tribeca LTDs the same day. Absolutely love this SUV. Solid feel, great handling, fun to drive, very comfortable, loaded with features and thoughtful amenities. Feels comparable (and even preferable) to Lexus/BMW/Mercedes/Acura SUV at 10k less. All of the other SUVs I'd considered were on the dealers trade-in lot from people who bought Tribecas. My wife is getting 18/24 mpg on her used 2006 Tribeca B9, however I'm still in break-in period and getting 12-18 mpg."
subaru,tribeca,2008,bn2002bn, 05/01/2008,Outstanding SUV!,4,"The first Subaru we've owned and we love it!  We were looking at the Honda Pilot(booring look), Toyota Higlander Hybrid(cheapo interior, drives like truck), GMC Acadia(drives like a bigger gas guzzling truck),Acura MDX (liked this but not as much as the Subaru for lots of little reasons not to mention value).  The Tribeca immediately stood out.  The build quality is excellent.  The vehicle exudes confidence between the engine, all-wheel-drive, skid control, and all of the other safety features.  The flat engine is extremely smooth even during hard acceleration(almost flooring it). The 3rd row is a little cramped but we only have 2 kids and aren't going cross-country in it either. Great car!"
subaru,tribeca,2008,lisa, 05/14/2008,Very Pleased,4,"I purchased the '08 Tribeca 6months ago. I am very happy with the vehicle. I previously had the Audi A4 and it was one problem after another. The Tribeca is more comfortable, has a smoother drive, and is more reliable. I would get it again."
subaru,tribeca,2008,CA Subaru , 05/21/2008,Subaru fan,5,"This is our second Subaru - also own 2003 Forester. It snows where we live and the Subaru AWD is arguably the best on the market. Wanted a larger Subaru, but did not like the styling of the original B9 Tribeca, nor its lack of power and premium fuel requirement. All these objections overcome with the new version. It handles like a smaller vehicle, is very secure feeling, and comfortable (except for adults in the third row, but we knew this when we bought it - it is fine for children. "
subaru,tribeca,2008,D CRUZ, 05/24/2008,It replaced my BMW,5,"I have had BMW's for well over 20 yrs. In looking for a new all wheel drive car after moving to Colorado, the only thing that came close to the feel and performance of both my BMWs was this vehicle. In the snow it will out perform anything out there. Soild on the road, great perfomance for a 6 and good fuel mileage. Planning to trade in my second BMW in the fall for a Subaru sedan"
subaru,tribeca,2008,Angela, 12/01/2010,Good Choice,4,"When the lease was up on our bmx x5, we chose the tribeca. The monthly bill was way less, a little over half of what we were paying for the BMW. All in all, we've been happy with this car. The small gas tank is a bit of a drag. The gas mileage isn't great. But from what I hear, it isn't terribly out of range for a comparable car. Would love a split rear hatch. The door is heavy and hard to pull down with one hand. I've gotten stronger, though. There's a bit of a leap when you first touch the gas pedal. Our lease is up in March, and I think we'll buy this car."
subaru,tribeca,2008,Brad, 10/18/2008,Overall Great SUV,4,"Purchased vehicle 7 months ago after much deliberation and was extremely happy with my choice.  I understood the shortcomings: no telescoping wheel or bluetooth, small gas tank and 19-23 mpg (not bad considering AWD).  However after I had the oil transmission cooler installed, the transmission hasn't shifted correctly again.  Stays in gear too long, hard shifts etc.  Working with the dealer to attempt a fix.  All in all, a great vehicle for the price, all essential features and then some.  Look hard at the this vehicle; you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't!"

Transmission clunks hard into first gear downshifting to a stop; A/C is not cold enough for a cabin of this size - dealer said it was overcharged; suspension clunking sound made from the front wheels when hitting slightest of bumps  reminds me of bad ball joints in an old car; acceleration at cruising speed not smooth, instead feels out of balance; gas cap rests on exterior paint during refuel, need telescoping steering wheel; back seats wobble and make noise as does the rear seat belt from the ceiling; exhaust makes tinny vibration sound when accelerating hard. Expected more from this vehicle."

Car rides nice, fairly quite and smooth. Have had WAY TOO many vehicles,and just traded in a Hyundai Santa Fe Limited. There are trade-offs, but I would put the Santa Fe first for now. Still happy with the choice, but time will tell. Getting 19 MPG so far. Rate a BUY for good value! "
subaru,tribeca,2008,Mira, 10/13/2008,My Subaru Tribeca,4,"This is my 1st Subaru and the 1st SUV. I have about 700 miles on it and love it so far. I've been averaging 18.6 mpg in the city. Once in a while I can hear the rear seat belts making noise, especially if you have something leaning against them. Overall very comfortable ride, fairly smooth. Radio controls on the steering wheel are nice, but I manage to hit them accidentally when turning somehow. Gas cap rests on the exterior paint during refuel, don't really like that, but it's minor. I'm 5.9"" and steering wheel adjustment is fine, no problems, plenty of leg room. My insurance went down a little due to Subaru being a safer vehicle. It handles like a smaller car, and has plenty of cargo room."
subaru,tribeca,2008,Mr. Subaru, 10/28/2008,Mixed Bag,4,"The 08 Tribeca is a mix of great features and questionable design components. The Tribeca is solidly built and handles like a car. The engine is powerful, and the transmission shifts smoothly. Steering and braking are crisp. The cargo area is surprisingly small for a vehicle this size, a tight fit for dogs. The gas mileage is poor (17 mpg mixed) compared to other vehicles in this category, and is compounded by a small gas tank which results in a VERY, VERY short driving range. I was spoiled by my 06 Outback's 500 mile range.  The thick A pillar makes turning corners a challenge if pedestrians are present.   "

subaru,tribeca,2008,Handsome36, 08/25/2007,A well made SUV that deserves attention,4,"After much debate on Tribecas 3rd row comfort, I bought the 2008 Tribeca.  It is smooth, wonderfully stable and deserves to be compared with lux utes.  It costs $7-8k less than the Acura and 10k less than Volvo and BMW but more reliable than either.  Very nice touches with ambient lighting, puddle lights (optional), etc.  It has very smooth engine and its dynamic stability control really works (unlike the one I had in my minivan), most effective AWD system of many out these and absorbs bumps very well.  Very little road noise too."

subaru,tribeca,2008,Souliman, 09/17/2007,Excellent,4,"Very happy. Quality is solid - interior and exterior design is perfect for family of four. We fit two car seats and small adult in second row without a problem. Third row is really for children or small adults - somewhat difficult to access. Acceleration is excellent in upper gears. Some engine whine in lowest gear. Seamless shifting otherwise. Handles more like a car than SUV. Ride quality is excellent, smooth. Compared to the Jeep Grand Cherokee with AWD (Rocky Mountain Ed.), the handling is more reliable on wet surfaces. It will be hard to beat the Jeep in deeper snow though - we'll see. Larger adults will feel somewhat awkward driving due to short steering column and seat position."

The new Tribeca is very quiet and smooth with plenty of power from the new engine. Getting 19-20 mpg in mixed driving, as high as 24 mpg on 2-lane highway at 60 mph. New tranny is very smooth, as is power delivery. New exterior was what I had been wanting, kind of bland grille but better than the fish-mouth of last year. Good handling for a crossover, ride is sweet, overall very impressed.  Boxer engine/AWD combo hard to beat.  "
subaru,tribeca,2008,regan, 09/06/2007,2008 Subaru Tribeca,4,Purchased our first ever Subaru.  Have always owned Honda.  The changes for 08 make an already very good vehicle better! Great performance with standard AWD. The interior is heads above the rest.  Would have liked a sliding armrest on the console.  My wife drives close to the steering wheel and the armrest is to far back for her.  Subaru will sell more Tribecas if they can get customers into showrooms to test drive them.  Put this one on your shopping list!!  
subaru,tribeca,2008,Suzy B., 07/28/2007,I'm impressed,4,"Just drove the new 08 Tribeca.  While cleaning my house and finding the Subaru magazine, I looked through it and found out about all the new changes of the 08 Tribeca.  I own a 06 tribeca and have always been disapointed with the engine and transmission.  So, went to town and drove the 08 and found the difference to be very very noticable within the first few seconds of driving it. I went back the next day and purchased the new 2008 Tribeca.  I love all the great changes.  Thanks Subaru!!"

Has a comfortable yet peppy driving response, good pickup in the city. This is my first Subaru purchase after years of VW driving, but I don't think it will be my last.

It drove more like a sedan with the horizontally opposed engine which is one of the reasons I bought this car over the Lexus or highlander.
Great in snow, and fun to drive.
Peppy off the start.
Technology was way behind (nav useless).
In fact all the tech in the car was below average, but if you don't care about that kind of stuff it's not a deal breaker.
Never had any problems with the car.
Gas mileage was low.
13 around city.
Long trips I'd average 21mpg.
Small tank hurt its range.
Couldn't get 300 miles without worrying about where the next gas station was."
subaru,tribeca,2009,tommymight, 05/16/2011,"Sucks gas, eats headlight bulbs and the doors won't unlock",3,"I had my 2009 Tribeca Limited for 2 1/2 years and I just traded it on a new non-Subaru vehicle. More negatives than positives for me.

Issue #1 is the fuel economy. I got 15 mpg around town in good weather and 12-13 mpg in winter. The car is great in snow, especially with Hakapelitta snow tires. On the highway, it was a miracle to get 21 mpg. The fuel tank is small - 16 gallons and I was filling it up constantly. Navigation system was weak, a $300 Garmin blew it away. This car EATS headlight and brake bulbs. I installed headlight bulbs 3 times in 2 1/2 years and brake bulbs twice.
Dealer parts department told me they sold a ton of bulbs. The remote key unlock took 4 clicks to open all doors"
subaru,tribeca,2009,scott2s, 08/11/2013,Great car,4,"I really like this SUV.
It drives like a car, handles excellent in the rain and snow and has enough seating for our family.
The gas mileage is average for a SUV of this size with AWD but with it would be better.
My teen age son prefers to sit in the rear seat and has plenty of space, so not sure why the 3rd row seat gets the bad rap in the Edmonds reviews.
This isn't a Suburban and I don't think anyone should expect caverns of storage and lay out seating in a SUV of this size.
This is just right for the daily driver and the ocational family road trip.
When I need extra storage space I use a $60 hitch mounted storage shelf that I store totes on.
Works great to put extra gear."
subaru,tribeca,2009,Jim D, 09/09/2009,After three Lexus Rxs This is a real gem,4,"Having leased Lexus RX vehicles for seven years, and enjoying all of them. I took advantage of the opportunity to buy a low mileage Tribeca.  While it doesn't have all the features (integrated bluetooth/Nav, express up/down windows, power rear hatch release/keyless entry etc.) it is an extraordinary vehicle that I have come to enjoy very much.  Multiple trips to the North woods of Wisconsin have become my second hobby because of the Tribeca. Fit & Finish, features, quality of workmanship, power/safety/great 4x4, Ipod connectivity, great seats, and best of all; it has Japanese quality control, but is assembled in Indiana.  I love the car, and it may be my last new car purchase. "
subaru,tribeca,2009,Len, 10/22/2009,Outstanding Vehicle,4,"Traded in a 2007 Lincoln MKZ on my Tribeca.  The Tribeca is superior to the Lincoln in every way.  It is extremely roomy (professional reviews notwithstanding).  Build quality is superb, no rattles, upscale looking, tons of room for passengers and cargo. I also have a 2008 Outback, and I can say that Subaru has it all together.  If you are worried about buying American, note that my Lincoln was assembled in Mexico, both my Subarus assembled in Indiana.  Which is the ""American"" car?????"
subaru,tribeca,2009,Ravi, 06/22/2009,"Fun-to-drive, Safe, Great looks",4,"After owning 3 Subarus since 1988, I bought Subaru's premium model-Tribeca Limited-7 Seats. Subaru's improvement over the years shows in Tribeca-A gorgeous interior design/luxurious feel; sleek exterior lines; ample ground clearance/best AWD in the business; 5-star crash ratings.  Pure joy to be in the driver's seat & has a solid feel on the road. We have driven our Tribeca on 1000 mile road trips of open freeways over weekends; winding steep roads and of course the in-town daily commutes/family and grocery hauling - Tribeca does it all with grace - a solid performer when it comes to merging on highways; changing lanes and passing traffic."
subaru,tribeca,2009,kari, 04/21/2010,Not happy!,2,"I have owned four Subaru Outbacks prior to this 2009 Subaru Tribeca and thanks to this nightmare I will never buy another one! We purchased the car brand new. I wanted another Subaru for sure but thought I would try another model. My station wagons NEVER broke down and drove problem free for years. This car had been in the shop due to "" check engine"" light on within the first eight months. Only to be told it's a faulty sensor and is fine. Yesterday my car lost power at 55 miles per hour- NO STEERING, NO GAS, check engine light back on and all I could was coast off the road. The car had to be towed. Service found the computer needed to be "" updated"" and now my car should be fine? NIGHTMARE."
subaru,tribeca,2009,Bob, 01/30/2009,My 2nd Tribeca,4," After 90k on my '06, I just bought an '09. (The '06 is still in the family, and my previous Legacies have made it to the high 200ks with one at 330k - without major repair.) I felt the ride on the '06 was hard & sharp, but the '09 has smoothed that. I feel it is still firm - not soft like the review stated. The driver's seat position has always given me more room than I need (6'1).  Although I like the outside ""look"", I'm one of the few who felt the '06 was original and creative (Alfa-Romeo comes to mind). Now it looks like a Chrysler.  As for interior space, if you need more room, buy a ""box."""
subaru,tribeca,2009,Maxwhite, 11/17/2010,"Love, Love, Love it.",4,"I have been a loyal Honda/Nissan customer for 15 years and my husband turned me on to Subaru. It was time to upgrade from his sporty WRX to something more family functional due to the arrival of our first child. I was leaning toward the Touareg or the Cherokee but space was limited. I have always purchased used cars and the 2009 was the only one on the lot when we went shopping. I was pleasantly surprised when I drove it and 15 minutes later I told them ""I'll take it"". It's now been 4 months and all the features meet our needs. I have since added bluetooth, auto start and a dual DVD. The space is incredible and hopefully will continue to fit the bill with two babies."
subaru,tribeca,2009,evansubi, 12/21/2011,2009 Tribeca,4,"I purchased this vehicle 2 years ago. 
At the time I was torn between the Tribeca and the Toyota Highlander. I priced both cars with the same (7seater, fully loaded) extras. Tribeca came to $39,200 and the Highlander $44,700. Then Toyota was willing to cut approx $1500-2000 dollars and Subaru cut $5000! So my final price for my car came to 34,200 dollars compare to 42,700 saved me about 8000... that alone is a great reason...

No problems so far.. 
Fast (8sec 0-60), economy I get is between 18-20mpg mixed. Drove it to new york ave 20.5-22.5 mpg on 65-85mph

Only concern is front shock sound.. will check at the dealer.. by the way 15.99 OIL Change is also a plus.!!!"
subaru,tribeca,2009,Floyd B, 12/24/2016,"First Subaru/ So far, gold stars",5,"This is my first Subaru.  I bought this vehicle used with a 2 year bumper to bumper warranty. I have just under 86k on the odometer. Carfax, one owner and it very obvious that this was the family car.  Christmas morning of 2016 will mark my first full week in this car.  The BAD: I'm experiencing some shaking at low speed(40-50 mph).  I have some interior lights that are out as well. The brakes are super soft...it almost feels as if there isn't any brake at all. With that said, I've own bigger SUVs (had a 2002 Ford Expedition)in the past with a better feel to the brake pedal. The Toyota dealership,  where I bought this car from said the brakes were find. I do not believe them. I think they are trying to wait out the 30 day warranty so they don't have to pay the cost to repair. Tip: a dealership will prolong any costly repair if they are aware that you have and extended warranty. Keep putting pressure on them and they will fix the issue. The GOOD: everything not mentioned in the bad. Super user friendly. Rides really nice. For its weight, the fuel economy is okay. But, I'm also not heavy footed. It rides and feels like it's mechanical brother, the Subaru Outback and Legacy. It's a very nice place to be (interior), minus the area's were the previous owners children or child has damaged. As I drive the vehicle more, I'll update if I can.

subaru,tribeca,2009,Abbey, 08/15/2009,"09 Tribeca - Solid, fun car",4,Overall the car is well designed - interior and exterior.  It is a good replacement for my big SUV but will still be able to get around in the snow and ice very well.  Love it so far !!!
subaru,tribeca,2009,Hi, 03/29/2009,09 Tribeca,5,Just traded in my 06 B9 Tribeca and bought an 09.  The handling on these SUVs are great and the ride comfort is best in class.  The engine has plenty of power and gets 25mpg on the highway.  The second row has limo like leg room and can easily handle adults over 6ft tall.  And best of all it has Symmetrical AWD which gets me through over a foot of snow with no problem.
subaru,tribeca,2009,Chr3s, 04/03/2009,A great pleasure,4,We searched for a new Jeep to replace the lease we had and because of the economy we found it was not affordable.  I did my research and looked at the Tribeca and fell in love with the interior.  We purchased the 5 passenger SE.  Sorry but it truly has more space than our old Jeep.  The crossover look had some time getting used to but it is one sweet car.  This one has great pick-up and very quiet.  It looks like a car from the future with its dash and design.  I just leased a Honda for myself before I found this one....but I know now what my next car will be if they don't try to improve it!
subaru,tribeca,2009,lamda, 04/25/2009,Excellent Vehicle,4,"My wife and I originally searched for a new Jeep to replace the lease we had.  We did our research and looked at the Tribeca and loved the interior among many other things. We ended up buying the 5 passenger SE. It definitely has more interior room than our 06 Jeep Commander.  You can't find a comparable vehicle for the price, quality and reliability.  The vehicle has great pick-up and drives very smooth.  Save your time and go look at the Tribeca.  You won't be disappointed."
subaru,tribeca,2009,bob jones, 04/29/2009,Very nice SUV,4,"After driving several SUVs, my wife and I narrowed it down to the MDX, Lexus 350, and the Tribeca.  We chose the Tribeca Limited.   The Tribeca was a good combination of sport and comfort with a reasonable price tag."
subaru,tribeca,2009,steveni1234, 06/11/2009,Not a MiniVan,3,"After test driving CUVs from Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Toyota and Ford, the Subaru was a very pleasant surprise.  The engine is very drivable around town and the ride experience is as luxurious as the premium brands.  The Tribeca feels more like a car as opposed to the minivan roots of the Toyota Venza and the Ford Edge.  Interior room for five is exceptional and rear storage area is huge.  Build quality approaches the luxury brands.  If you are in the market for a vehicle in this class, test drive them carefully.  My experience did not match up with the reviews on this site.  It was almost as if the experts were driving different cars!!!"
subaru,tribeca,2009,drake, 06/11/2009,Quality vehicle,5,"Overall excellent fit and finish. Very good comfort and performance.  Has nice pickup, great turning radius, very good visibility. First Subaru, previous Toyota owner. Very pleased with the quality, reliability, performance and appearance."
subaru,tribeca,2009,mkscott2, 07/20/2009,Great bang for our buck,4,"Shopped for a new car for 3 years.  We knew we were going to get a Subaru, and settled on the Forester, but ended up with Tribeca because of the size of the back seat (can sit between two large carseats comfortably), and a great deal on this model. Initially was not interested in Tribeca because of the high octane fuel requirement, which apparently changed this MY.  Took on its first long road trip, and so far has been extremely comfortable and fun to drive.  It has everything we were looking for in a long-distance vehicle.  The safety features are certainly a great selling point.  There aren't many options/accessories that we feel are missing.  Nice, solid vehicle!"
subaru,tribeca,2009,Pete, 01/06/2010,Love it,4,"Awesome compact truck. Has everything you need for your adventures!. Great gas mileage for a truck with AWD. The best handling truck i have ever been in! a TRUE AWD truck beats any 4WD any day, just cannot compare. "
subaru,tribeca,2009,Mike, 01/16/2010,Outstanding SUV,4,This is by far the best SUV I drove when trying to decide what to purchase.  I didn't know a vehicle could handle this well in the snow.  Performance is excellent and the vehicle is definitely comfortable.
subaru,tribeca,2009,subsub, 02/24/2010,good car not good time,4,"Car is good in upstate NY snow. the steering is corrective, accelerator cuts out when wheels spin, but...car is kind of heavy and doesn't compare to lightweight Forester on snowy roads straight line braking"
subaru,tribeca,2009,k mohsen, 03/20/2010,Love my Tribeca,4,"We got it during the xmas break. Though our winter was not that snowy this year it was great going up and down our street. Major difference from our fwd VW. I love driving it. Kids love the DVD and headsets. I would definitely get another. Mileage has been better than expected. I drove Montreal to Toronto and managed to achieve 27 mpg @ 65 mph. That is 6 mpg more than the rating. Nav system drove me a little nuts. I could not figure out what the little flag meant. It could have simply stated the word ""Start""."
subaru,tribeca,2009,ib76, 05/13/2010,Disappointed,3,"I was very excited about my new car, but only for 2 weeks. I purchased used car with 12,000 miles. Then problems started- rattles and transmission. My new car didn't accelerate well, made strange noises, took it to the dealer, reflushed transmission and after 3 weeks the same problem came back. Extremely disappointed. Suppose to be fun car to drive but turned out to be a complete disaster. After 3 months I traded in my Tribeca, of course lost a lot of money : (."
subaru,tribeca,2009,rorypang, 06/16/2010,"Good car, bad mileage",4,"I bought this car, last year before the bad North east winter. I was really pleased with its snow weather handling, it left stuck 4runners, and trailbazers behind. The car is excellent with overall driving, however issues I have are; very bad mileage approx. 16 mpg, for city, small fuel tank, dated design, dated nav  system, unrealistic third row, the radio steering controls are not practical, no bluetooth, no ipod controls. I am really thinking of trading it in for the X5 diesel, it gives 26 mpg."
subaru,tribeca,2010,South Dakota, 04/21/2010,Read all the reviews,4,"I read everything on line about the Tribeca.  It was frustrating as many of the reviews contradict each other (e.g. one says there is very little body roll, the brakes are great while another says there is too much body roll and the breaks are spongy).  You have to drive it yourself to judge.  I was a Chevy Trail Blazer owner (LTZ) and I have to say the Tribeca drives way better, is more responsive, and stops quicker than the trailblazer.  Yes, a lot of reviewers say gas mileage is poor on the Tribeca.  Indeed, but measure it against any other all wheel drive and none of them are any better (the reviewers seem to compare the all wheel drive of the Tribeca with the 2 wheel drive of other make"
subaru,tribeca,2010,Nick, 09/11/2010,Safety and 7 passengers at a value price,4,"We purchased a Tribeca because it's the smallest and cheapest seven passenger vehicle with a perfect safety rating from both the federal government and IIHS. It's easy to drive and handles well on city streets, freeways, and winding mountain roads. Engine power and acceleration are more than adequate, although it's certainly no sports car. We've never taken it off road but the ride quality is good on rough pavement. The interior is comfortable on long trips. Climate controls are easy to use. The second row seat is wide enough to actually hold three people in reasonable comfort. Overall I am very happy with the Tribeca. There's nothing else which gives you so many features at the same price."
subaru,tribeca,2010,Michael S., 04/30/2010,1000 km Review,3,"My family have been loyal Volvo owners for the last 12 years.  Given Volvo's current lack of a value proposition we decided to expand our horizons before purchasing a car this year.  My checkpoints for our decision were a. needed to be real AWD; b.  must accommodate 2 6 ft+ boys comfortably in the back seats; and c. it need to fit our budget.  Point A eliminated a bunch of vehicles very quickly.  Point B narrowed the list down even further.  After looking at Mercedes, Audi, Volvo, VW, Toyota and Nissan's offerings we went off to look at Subaru's offerings on a friends recommendation.  We took a 60 minute test drive of the car and came back thrilled with the drive, the space and the value."
subaru,tribeca,2010,Alex K., 09/16/2010,2000 miles of joy,5,"I was looking for 7-seat SUV as well as for luxury, safety and reliability. First I tested Audi Q7, then Acura MDX, Lexus. Then looked at Volvo XC90 and BMW X5. Not decided. Then I went to the dealership for my Forester's regular service and tested Tribeca. I felt just as comfortable in it as in the previous cars. Price was much less so it was done deal.  Some complain about fuel economy of Tribeca. But guys, this is not your old little Subaru! This is almost a truck! After about 1200 miles I started getting about 16 mpg in Brooklyn and more than 21 mpg on highway. Just as promised. In line with other vehicles in the class. Also it speeds up really well in sport shift mode."
subaru,tribeca,2010,bob636, 08/09/2014,My 1st Subaru is disappointing,2,"I recently purchased a used 2010 Tribeca 3.6 L engine , my first Subaru, and am rather pleased except for a 'howl' in my automatic transmission.
The sound changes as goes up through gears and especially noticeable from start through 2nd.
Dealer has determined it is the alternator since engine speed also changes as gears change.
Cannot believe any auto manufacturer would make their top of the line 'touring' vehicle with this howl or whine as I have been told by others.
Either way a defective alternator OR transmission needs to be replaced."
subaru,tribeca,2010,mike, 03/14/2010,Very pleased,4,"Traded my 06 2WD Pilot on my Tribeca. Subaru has more comfort,better handling and (2 MPG more) than the Honda. 21-22 Highway and 19-20 around town after 13,000 miles. Best comfort since my Chevy Tahoe. Interior really cool. Love low center of gravity with the boxer engine. Would buy another one next time around."
subaru,tribeca,2010,Soulcoughin, 11/17/2010,Powerful & Safe AWD Family Car,4,"Traded in '06 Outback for '10 Tribeca due to growing family. We were tired of the limited space in the Outback for rear facing car seats, wanted to upgrade to something with a bit more room. It is a great all around vehicle. The 'beca has plenty of power and handles corners with ease. Seats are wider than in the Outback, which makes long trips much easier on a big guy like myself. Third row is tight, but I was able to fit back there. In reality third row is meant for kids, so not a big issue for us. We purchased the ""base"" Tribeca, but the vehicle comes with standard features that come as options in competing vehicles such as the Traverse. Overall we have been very happy with our purchase."
subaru,tribeca,2010,Jeff Block, 01/13/2010,1000 miles and here's the verdict,3,"I'm a Subaru newbie. Made the decision to move away from Toyota in favor of the Tribeca based on its looks and features. Having now traveled in the car for over 1000 miles here are my gripes: 1) The steering wheel mounted audio controls are poorly placed.  I seem to always change the radio station every time I make a hard turn. 2) Poor gas mileage.  Averaging 18.6 highway miles per gallon. 3) I feel no difference from regular drive mode to 'Sport' mode. 4) Fit and Finish on the leather seats is poor.  Lots of bunched up spots. 5) Not enough small storage room for sunglasses, wallet, Garmin, etc... 6) The Good-Year tires that it came with stink in the snow! 7) Audio controls are layed out odd"

The Boxer engine puts out great passing power. I don't always relax when driving it because I'm afraid someone will be on their cell-phone, not pay attention and hit me.My wife test drove the car and a young girl on her phone tried to cut in front of us and almost caused an accident. I love my Subaru!"
subaru,tribeca,2010,GoGators, 10/16/2010,Gotta love a Subaru,4,"This is my fourth Subaru so I'm sold on the versatility, reliability, and safety. This Tribeca is great on performance, appearance, and comfort. It ranks number 1 in safety for its class but lacks in the fuel economy. That is probably because this vehicle is heavy and uses the all-wheel drive all the time. The third row seat is nice for children 8 and under but not  realistic for adults. However with the third row seat down there is plenty of storage room. My biggest complaints are not having the electronic fold-in mirrors for tight spaces like the garage and better fuel economy. Current at 9,889 miles and no issues. "

3rd row is great for 2 extra passengers."
subaru,tribeca,2010,Mike, 11/05/2010,Like no Other,4,After 8000 km this car is definitely fun at the wheel.  With the one of a kind symmetrical AWD this car is firmly planted on the road and while driving I always feel in full control of the vehicle. With a low center of gravity due to the lower placement of the Boxer engine this car does not sway while turning.  With two small children safety is a top priority and with the 5 star crash test and safety ratings we could not ask for more. The stylish interior is a sight to behold and with smooth lines it is also very easy to wipe clean. Visibility is great front and back and the over-sized side mirrors are a bonus. Seats are comfortable and firm and on long rides the body stays rested. Great car
subaru,tribeca,2010,Roman, 11/13/2010,"2010 Tribeca Ltd - 2,000 mile review",4,"After 2000 miles still love the handling and safe feel of the Tribeca.  The leather seats are comfortable, and the power moonroof is nice too. The home-link on the sun visor eliminates all the remote control clutter. Have not setup the Blue-tooth as yet. Getting better mileage then advertised, around 18.5 mpg city, don't know about highway.  Would like to see more storage compartments up front - glove box just big enough to hold manual nothing else. I have not tried the transmission in Sport mode - regular mode seems plenty perky and alive."
subaru,tribeca,2010,Alex D, 11/29/2019,Great reliable car!,5,"I do not remember writing a review before but I kind of feel that I have to now. We purchased this car new in 2010 and wanted to keep it. No disappointment whatsoever. It is a great reliable car. 200km+ and it still runs like it should. The only repair was this year and it was a bulb change. It is fun to drive and invincible in snow (we live in Toronto, Canada). It is not perfect but I guess, nothing is. I average 13 liters per 100km, about equal mix of highways and city. By the way we also have Subaru Legacy, great car as well:)

subaru,tribeca,2011,olegs, 04/20/2011,Excellent quality; average look,4,"This is our second Tribeca.
The first 2006 was an attractive looker with distinctive Alfa Romeo front but was lacking the performance. The new 2011 is a complete opposite.
Average Pacifica like look with improved power and excellent track on quality and reliability.
This is the only SUV that we'll trust on our trips to skiing resorts.
Nobody can bit Tribecas handling in a nasty winter storm, especially with a set of dedicated winter tires.
We also like the fact that it is Japanese made but assembled in USA.
You have both: Japanese superior engineering and outstanding American quality."

subaru,tribeca,2011,Robson Braga, 05/06/2020,Comfortable and safe,5,"I just bought a 2011 Subaru Tribeca Premium, with 100k miles. This one is very proper, all the maintenance was did right and the vehicle is very sharp. I find it very comfortable, stylish and safe, because of the Subaru's AWD System. I love the fact that even having a third row, there's still some considerable cargo room. The engine is very powerful, although it has poor gas mileage. Actually, that's the only thing I have to complain about the car, poor gas mileage, but, come on, it's a 6 cylinder engine with continuous AWD. In terms of style, for me, it's far pleasant than the 2011 Honda Pilot or the 2011 Toyota Highlander. Anyways, I have no idea why people don't like this mid-size crossover.

subaru,tribeca,2011,M., 11/17/2010,An SUV that handles like a sports car.,4,"The 2011 Tribeca incorporates the exceptional comfort and feature set of a true luxury car, but with a surprisingly low center of gravity and handling ability of a sports car. It is the most quiet and comfortable SUV I have yet driven, and although the suspension is sufficiently soft to absorb virtually all bumps in the road, it by no means sacrifices control or handling. When the all wheel drive is factored in, the handling can only be be described as phenomenal.  

The 3.6L aluminum flat six cylinder engine, paired with the five forward speed automatic transmission, supplies head-snapping torque, while the 256 horsepower performance provides amazing acceleration."

Also only able to install 'whereis' GPS software which cost AU$295 for a one year map. Subaru and Kenwood refused to re-program or show me how to re-program unit.

and is fun to drive. The XV makes great use of its space, especially with the seats folded down. The interior is simple but well constructed.
The controls are intuitive. This car is fun to take through corners at a decent speed. Despite the 8.7inches of ground clearance, there's very little body roll. The suspension and traction on rough back roads is great. Acceleration is good from a stand still and adequate in the mid range.
 Not much torque so I frequently need to downshift for hills. Also, the engine is loud and revs high at highway speed. "
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,dashriprocket, 11/26/2012,Great Car if you can find one!,4,"Bought this car over a week ago.
Three months of constant research after selling my Honda Element which I loved. I was looking for something sold, unique looks, reliability, comfort and just a plain kick but car.
My Subaru XV Crosstrek limited in blue with beige interior...not a pocket rocket, but I genuinely love this car.
Extremely practical, unique, good looks, great gas mileage, great performance! "
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,salacious, 11/12/2012,"So Far, A Great Car",4,"The Crosstrek is no Ferrari, but it IS very quick off the mark (i.e., zero to 30-40mph).
 That said, it also loses its *rate* of acceleration in the mid-speed range prior to reaching 60-70 mph. If you need to keep up a decent (but not great) rate of acceleration, you will need to push down quite a bit further on the gas pedal.


Nonetheless, acceleration is easily adequate to merge into freeway traffic.
Ignore the reviewers who say otherwise. 
 
For the vast majority of gas-mileage-conscious customers looking for a smallish SUV-style of vehicle with a great AWD system, this car is very hard to beat.
If you dont care about gas mileage or AWD or want a boat-like SUV, look elsewhere."
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,stickybutfun, 12/30/2012,Love my new Subaru XV,4,"Finally got my Orange Subaru last week. Put 700 miles on it already and loving it. Sometimes I don't know what people want when they say it lacks power. We can only go so fast going from point A to point B. I rather pick a car that gets me 30mpg than go 0-60 in 4 secs. Less MPG= More use of natural resources= bad for environment. Let's hope gas prices doesn't go up to $6 then you will see what I'm talking about. For those that want more power get a sports car, not a practical family car. Car rides smooth, handles great and most importantly gets great gas mileage for a crossover. So far, it is a great car with great styling. "
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,belchfire, 04/17/2013,Way better than standard impreza,3,"We were in the market for a new car. We own a 2000 impreza and have been very pleased with it. 230K miles and very few problems. I saw that the 2012 impreza with the 2.0 engine and CVT transmission was rated @36 MPG. This is super mileage for an AWD vehicle. I test drove one and wasn't completely sold on it. I trashed the shocks, brakes and the fact that the base model doesn't have cruise control. There must have been a hidden microphone because not long after the crosstrek was introduced. They fixed everything. Better suspension, huge killer brakes, bigger gas tank & radiator and a lower gear ratio. Nice 17"" wheels and a more ridged body structure.
Much, much better car 30+ mpg so far."

The most amazing thing about this car? How safe it is! I hit the deer going about 55 mph, both the steering wheel airbag and, to my surprise because I did not know it existed, an airbag at knee - calf level. Upon hitting the deer the car felt solid, and in the drivers seat I felt completely secure, I was not going anywhere. My Subaru provided me with the ultimate protection from the accident and I will forever rant about how safe and amazing this car is. I am 17 years old and this was my first car, and I recommend this car for worried parents who want the safest car on the road. "

I'm 6'4"" and have plenty of legroom & even with the moonroof still had enough headroom.
not the fastest vehicle on the road, but plenty of power to get it moving, merging or passing on the highway, just need to punch it.
road noise isn't as bad as consumer reports describes, not sure what they're comparing it to?

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,rockymntnguy, 01/15/2014,Excellent Performer in Colorado Mountain Snow,4,"Bought my Limited 8 months ago. Already 21K on Colorado highways, mountain roads & Denver city streets. Commute from my cabin near Bailey in mountains an hour to downtown Denver. That drive is on Highway 285 up & down from 5,280 to 11,000 ft. Lots of passing. Then on 2 lane county asphalt road for 3 miles from highway.
Then county maintained gravel road to my cabin.
Have also made many drives on I-70 to for summer hiking & winter skiing areas. Traded a Jeep Commander V-8.
Big change.
Yes, a 4 cylinder CVT takes some finesse but accelerates and passes just fine. I drive it hard & minimum MPG is 27. Get 31 on easier mountain highway trips.
AWD performs well.
Very satisfied.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,merliech1, 02/24/2013,Awesome car for the price,4,"I bought my XV Crosstrek in November of last year and have now driven it over 5400 miles.
I am averaging 28.8 mpg currently and drive about 1/2 and 1/2 on city roads and highways.
I love how comfortable the car is, love the cvt transmission which is nice and smooth, love the overall style of the car and love how it handles in the snow.
I also upgraded the speakers and added the subwoofer.
Absolutely amazing sound.
Paid about $25k for the car and definitely feel I got my money's worth.
I previously owned a 2003 Forester.
Purchased the XV Crosstrek for the improved gas mileage.
I honestly believe that I will be a life-long Subaru owner."
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,rivernsnow, 02/07/2013,Return of the rough rider,3,"3 or 4 stars, but am giving it the benefit of the doubt. Only had it a couple weeks. The engine has plenty of zip. The CVT noise is only noticable if you floor it, which isn't needed to get quick acceloration.
Corners and holds the road really well. Getting 26 MPG all around which is low for my 40 mile RT city/hwy commute. I'll wait till it's broken to see if it gets the advertised 28 MPG all around. Styling inside and out is nice. Front seats are quite comfy. The
back seats not so much which accent the abrupt or jerky ride. That's my biggest issue.
Annoying even over modestly rough surfaces.
Rougher than most of the other small/ midsize SUV's I drove.
Subaru needs to work on this ."
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,emg2211, 02/23/2014,Always wanted a Subaru and will never get anything else,4,"Love my crosstrek!! First Subaru ever and I should have got one years ago. Had a mazda3 loved it but horrible in the snow (nurses can't call out for snow storms) and horrible MPGs. So after 5 yrs of almost dying every snow storm in MA I made the choice to get my Subaru and I haven't looked back. I love it. It's safe, great MPGs, awesome in the snow and enough room for friends and my giant dog. If you are looking for a crossover SUV look into it. I will say downsizing engines took a few wks to get used to, pick up isn't as good but it still gets around great. I have about 6500+miles on it."
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,northerner3, 06/20/2013,Great little car,4,"I have had mine for 6 months now having bought it in the midst of an upper Michigan blizzard. This is a really decent suv. Nice looking exterior. The lifted suspension and larger tires make a difference over the typical Impreza. Very good in snow, deep or packed. The interior is somewhat plain, but to be expected at this price point. Great solid seats with plenty of room for my 6'2"" frame even in the backseat. Common sense controls work well. Limited cargo with the back seat up but a roof rack helps. Others complain about the power. This car is not slow. Its not a race car, but quick enough for traffic. Gas mileage has been great. I am averaging 27 city/highway and 37 highway which is great."

It took arguing and having to call Suburu directly but they did cover the cost of both. Now my car will not go out of park, apparently another malfunction this car is known for, being repaired tomorrow. I've driven a lot of cars over the years and this is by far the worse car I've ever had, I don't trust it. Shame on Suburu.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,hudsonvalleyny, 02/13/2014,Great Value & Fun To Drive,4,"The 5 speed Crosstrek rides smooth and handles well on rough roads. It's easy to maneuver, easy to park, has a very tight turning radius and zips around town handily. On the highway it feels solid and holds its own at high speeds. AWD is amazing in snow. Stated gas mileage is accurate, but I can do better: 26-30 in mixed, 32-34 hwy. Interior is comfortable but spartan.You have the basic features you need and they're all standard. Acceleration is surprisingly quick especially if you wind out the gears. Hills need a downshift. Gas pedal is more responsive than the rubbery CVT pedal. It's not as solid and spacious as our 2014 Forester but gets way better gas mileage. Wheels get attention!"

The exterior which I bought in dark gray is really sporty but sophisticated looking.
The interior is very comfortable and has a very simple and useful layout.
Plenty of room in the back seats with a 60/40 fold down for extra storage.
Love that daytime running lights, fog lights, and heated seats are standard with the premium model.
Interior lighting is very need with a calm red.
MPG has been as advertised.
Trade-in a pickup truck that got half of the MPG."
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,Karen, 12/12/2015,I thought they were supposed to be dependable,3,"I bought this Subaru brand new.  I liked it at first but found out quickly that it uses A LOT of oil!  I was told it's because of the light oil it uses.  I put oil in this car more than any other car I've ever owned!! I travel 80 miles to and from work 5 times a week.  I took EXTREMELY good care of this car.  Faithfully having the oil and filters changed at the dealership as per their suggestions.  Having the tires changed or rotated/balanced at their suggestion as well as brakes checked frequently and replaced.  Always took to a Subaru dealer and trusted them totally.  Now, at 70, 000 miles, I was hearing noises in the front end when I made a turn. I bring it to the Subaru dealer only to find out the front axles are worn to the point they need to be replaced!!  What??  This is unheard of in a 2013 car!  I plan on taking this 1000.00 dollar fix to the Subaru corporate HQ!!  Never buy this car.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,subitrek, 11/17/2012,Subitrek Follow-up Review of Crosstrek,5,"I posted a review of the Crosstrek Premium CVT several weeks ago.
I've had several additional weeks to drive the vehicle.
Subaru says that I should get 28 MPG combined and 33 MPG Highway.
I have consistently been getting 32+ MPG combined, and 37 MPG highway.
This has been a big suprise in getting much better than advertized MPG.
If your looking for a vehicle with sports car-like acceleration in mid-range then look elsewhere.
However, do yourself a big favor and test drive a Crosstrek, I think you will be really suprised in a good way."
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,rumely, 01/07/2014,winter heat,4,"for the most part I was happy with the XV till winter came. it dives fine but there is very low heat out put at the floor. it feels like the AC is on.
the dealer pulled it in a heated shop to check it. ?
and did not drive it out the back roads like i do to and from work.
The heater stays set on high and i never get warm.
they said it was working fine. 
My old VW Bugs had way better heat."
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,Connie, 09/10/2018,if you are buying a used crosstrek check history,3,"Where do I start... First I'll tell you about the mechanical issues I've had.  At 60,000 miles I had to have the lower part of the engine replaced do to leaking oil to the tune of 2 quarts a week. I've replaced both front axles, 3 of 4 wheel bearings. I will possibly be replacing the 4th tomorrow. I had trouble with it idling rough within the first few month I owned the car. The dealer I bought the car from has helped me out with a lot of this but still the frustration and irritation factor at dealing with all this has not been fun. This is my first Subaru and honestly it will be my last. I bought it after talking to others who absolutely loved their ""Subies"". Unfortunately my experience has not been pleasant at all.  The other negatives are the seats are really uncomfortable for long drives, the windshield wipers aren't spaced right the passenger always has water left behind from wipers when it rains, the head lights are really dull on low beam, the inside of the windshield is hard to clean because of the angle and the ice metallic silver seems soft, the paint chips easily. On a positive note the MPG is decent. I love the heated seats. There is the perfect amount of room for me personally. I like the higher ground clearance. it makes it easier to get in and out of the car when you have a bad back. Part of the reason I bought the car was the low roof line so I could put my Kayaks on the roof easily. Also it is amazing in the snow and ice we get here in Pa. I also love the way the CVT transmission shifts. For a 4 cylinder engine it has plenty of pep. I don't have any issues merging onto highways or dealing with all the hills and mountains where I live.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,tquigsmay, 05/06/2013,loving my new crosstrek,4,"i really missed my saturn vue, but i wanted better gas mileage. i checked out kia sportage, hyunai tucson, honda crv, mazda cx-5, mitsubishi outlander, nissan rouge, ford escape, chevy equinox, and subaru forester. no 1 car had everything on my wish list. 
i didn't see this car til the last minute when i went to buy the forester. the crosstrek got my attention with the cool wheels and sleek design. 
this suv had everything on my list except auto headlights and navigational mirrow- direction in rear view mirror. 
my dealer was pretty cool. they agreed to trade out the mirrors. the way around the no auto headlights is to leave them on-they go off when you turn the car off. i love it so far."

I was sad to trade it in but I am so SO thrilled about this Crosstrek. First of all, the appearance is sweet - I have gotten so many compliments on how sharp-looking the car is (which is what I thought, too!) The interior is also really nice and very comfortable, with all of the creature comforts I wanted in a vehicle (heated front seats, tinted windows, iPod hookups, etc.) I bought the car in a 5-speed manual and I have had nothing negative to say about the pickup and the power for this size vehicle. The gas mileage is as advertised, which I imagine has to do with the manual transmission. I will continue to buy Subaru."
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,rivernsnow, 09/20/2013,After 9 months review,4,"Nice Little SUV. Cool looking! Sufficiant power, but not a sports car. Steady pedal application versus jamming it down, eliminates most of the comments about droning or response. Very comfortable front seats, Great road hugging performance! Rides rougher than expected. It's small so with two adults and a toddler on a road trip it's really packed to the max. Like Edmunds review said, does not get advertised mileage. Expect 25.5- 26 MPG average Using 89 octane brings it up to 27- 28
Bad - can't power or remote entry lock without arming alarm. If you use a sub key/non remote entry key, alarm wakes neighbors at 5 AM. Manual locking not available on rear hatch!!! No air vents for rear passengers"

I drive a mix of city and highway and have been averaging 28.8-29.1. My mom bought one a month before me and she drives only city in a busy shopping area, so she is not the most fuel-efficient driver (quick starts/stops). I absolutely LOVE this car - it handles so well, feels so secure and solid on the road, very comfortable, has all the conveniences I need (heated seats, rearview camera, HD radio, etc), and on top of that both my mom and I get compliments (esp the wheels) wherever we go! I love driving this car and am excited for the AWD in winter - this drives much better than my RAV4, glad I switched to Sub!"
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,connrailfan, 05/01/2014,"Not For Big People, Sold Soon After This Post",3,"I bought my Subaru XV Crosstrek in August of 2013. It was peppy and fun to drive. They are nice looking cars and have a nice feel for the road. Compared with other cars I test drove, the Crosstrek had less modern, and not thought out dashboard. For example: The main gauges are red, which is great at night, but there are two glaring blue panels in the dash too that compete. There aren't as many gauges as other cars too, mostly warning lights. The dash bezels also squeaked on bumps. I'm a 5' 10"" man. I had the seat all the way back. Three months with the car I started have back issues from the seats that grew worse. By this spring it was difficult for me to drive for any length of time.

5/1/16- I sold the Crosstrek soon after I wrote the initial review. The Subaru seats did create a problem with my back. BTW- I never had any back issues until I bought the SV Crosstrek. It took a zillion visits to the chiropractor and about a year driving another vehicle before my back felt better. I never asked the doctor, but I think it might have been my hips that had the real trouble with the Crosstrek seats. I know many people who drive this car with no problems, but I also know some others who had a similar experience to me.  If you are having an issue, get rid of the car! The first clue is you will find yourself stuffing pillows in the lumbar area of the seat. I took a big financial hit, but decided my back or hip problems were definitely from the Crosstrek. AND THEY WERE! I sold the car after 8 months and 15,000 miles and have not regretted it.

I drove a 2011 outback for a little while with the cvt and was under powered. I choose the 5 speed crosstrek
because of the lack of power on the cvt . I think if you stick with the 5 speed it really brings out the true car. it would be even better is there was a turbo version. the build quality is better than the outback probably because its made in japan. "

So far I have not been disapionted ! I drive 60 miles per day for work on a highway that can be very nasty in bad wheather. I got hit with a couple of snow storms right after buying this.
Very nice! handled like a dream. Used the heated seats very comfortable. Getting around 27.6 combinded and 30-32 straight highway.

I've seen lots of complaints on gas mileage and I just don't understand - I drive quite a bit of city and then some highway to work and I average 27.5 in winter and 29.5 in summer. My mom drives all short city trips and is closer to 25.5 (EPA estimate is 23 city, so that makes perfect sense). I've been out in several Cleveland snowstorms and the handling was so amazing and I felt so safe. My husband loves it so much that in bad weather he will not take out his 4WD Trailblazer but instead uses my car. I LOVE THIS CAR!!!!"
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,Shelly Marshall, 09/05/2015,Nice ride at expense of tire wear and Oil use,2,"I updated this review because I've learned more about the Crosstrek that applied to me since I traded it in. (I feel sorry for the ones who bought it after me) My update will appear at the end of my original review which is here:

I like the feel of driving this. Good points is the MPG (unless the wind blows against you then it drops by 10 MPG--that is not a joke! ANYTHING but during downhill and you lose the great mileage) I have a cage in back for little dogs--and I like the way that works. The storage is wonderful. easy to see out windows and easy to drive in traffic.

Down side. Cloth seats stain when you sneeze! Horrible how bad the seats look in just a few years. I wish I had gotten leather. Very noisy on the road--good thing noise doesn't bother me too much but it drives others crazy. The worst thing about the vehicle is the tire wear. The vehicle  is not worth it because it eats tires like crazy and the dealers and Customer Service for Subaru both handle this fact as if it is your fault.
This is what dealers in Arizona, California, Utah, Montana, and Alaska have actually said to me:
a) its your driving
b) its out of alignment (fixed THREE times but never corrected tire wear)
c) its because you carry an ice chest and food in the back when you travel
d) its the 300 lb motorcycle trailer you pull
e) its all the potholes you hit
f) it must be heavy passengers that you carry in back
g) its your toy Pomeranians that you carry in a cage in back
h) its the tires you buy

It's not any of those things. At 70,000 miles, I was on my 5th set of tires! The first set went out at 19,000! What is up with that? The last set of tires I bought were rated hard tires (602) with a 60,000-mile warranty and after only 25,000 miles Subaru in Fairbanks refused to rotate the tires because they say I need new ones, AGAIN! It was Anchorage Subaru who told me if I bought the hard tires and they wore out that fast, that the tire company would honor the warranty. I figured it was a good solution to badly wearing tires--problem was, when the tire company saw the tires, they blamed the Crosstrek and refused to honor the warranty. 

Incredible. I own a 2013 CrossTrek. Something is very wrong with the tire wear. Soft tires get 15,000 and hard rubber gets 25,000--that is not right. Buyers beware. (You will find more reviews like this about the tires on the Internet). There is either something wrong with the Subaru I bought or with  he crosstalk in general.

My second major complaint is the customer care department. The problem showed up at 19,000 when I almost killed myself on bald tires.  That is when the excuses began. Even though I had a 60,000 mile or 3-year warranty, they strung me along until the warranty ran out--paid for one alignment and then kept telling me, ""this time it will be different"" . Once the warranty was out, I was out of luck even though there was something definitely wrong with the vehicle and I began the process at 19,000 miles. The only thing Subaru did for me besides string me along until the warranty ran out was align my vehicle, buy one set of tires and assure me they wanted to take care of the problem--which never happened.  Hollow words, really. 

I will never buy another Subaru. Not because of the tire wear and something being wrong with my vehicle, things go wrong! I own a business and nothing is ever 100%. so I cut slack for businesses. The trouble is the warranty was not honored--not the one that came with the original purchase or their extended warranty.

I expected better from Subaru because they have been good in the past-but this was ridiculous--to blame me (who has driven for 40 years) and make sure that they did not correct the problem and let both my warranties run out. I wasted a lot of time and money on this problem--and as far as I'm concerned, Subaru owes me the money back from my extended warranty because they did
 not honor it. 

I have kept all my records and pictures and even a few tires--if someone does a class action, I'm in.

UPDATE 9.21.16 There is a class action--but not on the tire wear--on oil!!!! And that was one of the problems I had. The car went through  LOTs of oil. I kept running out and I mentioned it several times. Once It was only 500 miles after an oil change. I called the dealer who changed my oil and they said they probably forgot one quart! I was so far away from that dealer that I didn't bother to take it back to them (they are in Ogden and I was in Arizona). The oil light came on a lot and I asked several Subaru dealers what was going on and they claimed there was nothing going on--acted as if I didn't understand cars. Now there is a class action suit about the oil--I probably put in an extra 5 quarts when I owned the vehicle so it isn't worth my time trying to find receipts to join the suit but I can take the time to warn others about the way Subaru strung me along on TWO issues and their warranty was worthless! I really believe they should refund me the money paid

I don't drive freeway often. I can't wait to see how it handles in the winter. When lease is up I am considering going to an Outback or Forrester.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,SAM, 10/11/2018,"If you really have to, just don't.",3,"If you're really set on getting a small, all-wheel drive, hatchback. Get the Impreza, or better yet, get another car completely. I bought mine with 7 miles on it in 2012, and drove it exclusively (minus all the times it was broken) till I traded it in in September 2018. The vent door in the dash broke just after warranty was up, during a drive to work through freezing fog. I had to keep my windshield washers (with fluid spraying) on the entire 10 miles down the road. The car ate 3 CV axels (which is low versus others I've heard, for the amount of miles I put on the car since they were mostly highway miles), and countless quarts of oil. As in every 1000 miles I had to add another quart, and according to the dealer, this is considered ""normal"". I had a Toyota Camry with an actual oil leak, and I never had to add oil... It's too light to be useful in any slightly adverse weather scenario. I got stuck in a parking lot with only 3-5 inches of snow on the ground, and while driving home during an ice storm (it was WAY worse than predicted), we repeatedly got past by 2 wheel drive cars while even going 25 mph felt like we were going to fishtail and spin out of control. I could feel the car slide sideways with any wind on a snowy mountain passes. The CVT went out twice in a year (once on acceleration from a stop, the second time I was traveling 70 down the freeway). They finally replaced the whole thing, but with a re-manufactured transmission.  The final straw was when the HVAC control panel apparently melted and the air compressor also needed to be replaced (another $2-3K). I was done with it. Traded it in for a used Toyota Corolla which handled just as well in the snow this past winter.  As far as the non-fatal issues: I could only get the light brown interior with the white exterior (which was dumb, but not a huge issue), the bluetooth ended up crapping out and not connecting to phones. It would take a lot of hitting the ""retry"" button before it finally connected. The hydraulics on the hatch were starting to go out, and it was a pain to have to slam closed every time, or hit my head because it wouldn't go up all the way. The road noise was very loud in the cabin, I often couldn't talk to people via bluetooth while driving. The gas mileage wasn't what was promised. It wasn't horrible, just not the 30 mpg I was hoping for. The good points, because it actually did have a few: the ground clearance, it was supper comfortable for me and my passengers. The turning radius, one can get out of a lot of tight spaces without using a 4-point turn. And it had the option of a less techy sound system. And it kind of looks like a turtle from the side. I realize that I probably got the car that Subaru made its employees come in on their day off to build, but to be safe, I say stay away from this model.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,sraskin, 04/07/2013,Bummed about MPG!,3,"I really like most things about the car but I am getting terrible (15-19) mpg after 3,000 miles and I don't understand why!


I purchased the car expecting it get pretty good MPG around the city, yet still be a fun weekend car for mountain adventures. It has a solid interior, good handling, relatively high clearance and a rugged look, all of which I like.
But for some reason the mpg is totally lacking.
I am a mellow driver and I do a mix of city/hwy, so I can't figure out any obvious explanation for the bad mileage."
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,Ira Blackburn, 11/08/2015,disappointed.,1,"We bought new 2013 Crosstrek knowing its limitations.  We have 40,000 miles on the odometer and took it to the dealership to diagnose a noise in the front end.   The Dealership diagnosed a broken front strut and a $700 repair.  I've never heard of a car breaking a strut at 40k that wasn't wrecked or abused.  We've gone from loving it to WTF? and hating it.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,ron_in_dg, 02/24/2013,First Subaru,5,"I bought my Crosstrek through Edmunds web site; this required me to go pretty far afield - I live in IL but the dealer is located in WI.
It was worth the trip to save the money.
None of the local dealers would negotiate price at all.
I got pretty much exactly what I wanted (plus the optional fancy rear view mirror and the all season floor mats) the first week the vehicle was available.
LOVE the car.
It is a lot peppier than I was expecting based on the reviews I had read.
It is great in the snow.
I've got about 4400 miles on it so far.
Ask me again in 10 years how it's doing."
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,greendesignguy, 01/07/2013,Great Ride!,4,"So, we have owned our Subaru XV Crosstrek Limited (Crystal Black Silica/Ivory Leather, Pop Package #1, Moonroof, and Navigation) for about a month now.
This vehicle is very difficult to find, and we would have had ours earlier had we not had to wait for it to arrive at the dealer.
It was also actually very difficult to find one to test drive, and we ultimately ended up testing out a demo version.

I will start with the items I find to be an issue, and then talk about the stuff I love.
First, as most have said, the vehicle lacks a little bit of power from the 40mph-60mph range, which is basically when you get on an interstate or highway.
This is somewhat mitigated through use of the paddle shifters (which can actually be quite fun, but I use them sparingly).
The acceleration is just fine otherwise.
Starts smoothly and quickly from a stop and accelerates quickly and smoothly once you are already up to speed as in passing situations.
The second item that is probably only an issue for me so it is really more of an annoyance and probably won't both many others is the way the dashboard cuts back to the passenger.
I am fairly tall (6'-7"") and I fit really well on the drivers side.
Plenty of legroom compared to a lot of vehicles in this range. The problem is that when I am a passenger my right knee does not touch the dash when the seat is all the way back, but the dash swoops back towards the passenger at the center console which jams my left knee into it.
It is not a big deal on short trips, but I have a feeling I will be doing all of the driving on the long trips.
And again, this will only be an issue if you are my height.
I would say anyone over 6'-4"" to check it out first to see if it bothers you.
Those are my only complaints, and quite honestly, they are not all that big of a deal.
On to the great stuff.
First, the XV Crosstrek has a wonderfully solid ride and handles impeccably.
We have owned many other small SUV/CUV vehicles and this one handles like a sports car compared to most of them.
I would even go as far to say that it is better than the Acura crossover that we had for about a year.
Next, the AWD works like a champ. Traveling for the holidays we were mostly driving through snow and ice, and this thing felt like it was magnetized to the road.
On top of that, we were loaded down with two people, a large dog, all of our luggage and Christmas gifts driving in crappy, high wind weather and we still got 30 mpg.
When it is just I or my wife driving in normal conditions we average that for both city and highway driving.
I have to say this is one of the things that brought me to Subaru in the first place, great gas mileage on an AWD vehicle, and it has more than exceeded my expectations.
All of the features of the vehicle are very nice (Moonroof, voice activated Navigation, backup camera etc.)
, and I have found the leather interior to feel like it is of very high quality.
The other interior finishes are also on par and even the plastics have a soft tactile feel to them.
The interior design is simple, which is nice because it does not feel cluttered like a lot of vehicles today.
One tech item I wish was part of the vehicle though is a read out of tire pressures.
It has a tire pressure monitor/warning system, but nothing that tells you what the pressure currently is.
We had this in another vehicle of ours and found it to be a functional and useful tool.
On the exterior, I love the rugged yet refined look that the vehicle has from its added height, modified bumpers and especially the rims.
Can't say enough how cool the rims are.


Finally, a couple of other things to mention I would like to mention.
First, the way the engine compartment is setup it will make it very easy to do routine maintenance if that is your thing.
I will probably change our own oil and air filter as required.
Second, while many dealers are not open to dealing
 on this vehicle, if you play your cards right, you can still get a deal as some dealers are open to dealing on the price.
The biggest suggestion would be to make the dealers compete against one another and don't set foot into the dealership to finalize the deal until you have a price locked from email or phone communication.
Doing so allowed us to get our Crosstrek ($28,200 MSRP) for $24,300, which makes for an incredible value on this vehicle.
I hope that this review helps anyone that is interested in this vehicle.
We really do love this car and could not be happier with it.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,rockyjoe, 10/26/2012,Subaru XV Crosstrek Premium CVT,4,"Got the first one in the area last week.
After reading the early ""expert"" reviews, was pleasantly surprised that the car with CVT had plenty of pep and power, handling mountain roads/midrange acceleration with ease.
Gas mileage slightly better than advertised, in mixed driving.
Very nice build quality and interior materials.
Yokohama Geolandar tires are a big plus for snow country!
Handles beautifully, and very quiet on road.
This is a good-looking, quality car, versatile enough for all-around use on all road surfaces and weather conditions, with very good fuel economy.
The heated seats/mirrors complete the package.
By far the best, most functional and attractive crossover I've seen!"
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,noah_early, 09/19/2013,"I loved my Crosstrek, but it needs more power",5,"I work in DC, but we own a cabin in Lexington, VA and live in Northern VA.
It handles gravel roads as well as the interstate and can easily surpass the EPA ratings if you drive like a sensible adult.  If you are disappointed with your MPG try comparing your odometer with mile markers or GPS.
Mine read almost 2% slow, which means we are actually getting over .6 MPG better than the car calculates.  The car would say you had driven 100 miles when you had actually gone 101.9  Our 2005 Forester 2.5X was off in the other direction by over 4% which is why I checked the Crosstrek.  If you are behind one that is going a little slow, that is probably why.  They don't realize 70 on the speedo means they are only going 67.
The ground clearance is perfect, our 80+ pound lab mix can get in and out of it without the struggle he has with our Jeeps and it has not bottomed out on several rutted, gravel roads.
It burned a little oil.  If we went more than 5,500 miles between changes the low oil light would come on.  We were going to have the dealer look into that, but it was hit at 19K miles and replaced with a 2015 Forester XT Limited with EyeSight.  A drop of less than 3 MPG (26.9 average after 8k miles) and premium fuel for 100 more HP and much more room is a decent trade-off.
Also check visibility before buying.  The high belt line and low roof make rear visibility poor for shorter drivers.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,hittheroadjack, 03/10/2014,Best Bang for your Buck! 1st Time Subie Owner,5,"I purchased my Crosstrek Limited in 2013, and I am still trying to find excuses to drive it.
I love it!
It's just the right size for us.
Small and nimble enough to navigate the urban 9-5, but large enough for our weekend adventures.
Plenty of room for toddlers giant car seats, and the height is ideal for them to get in and out.
I have had several 4 cylinder cars, and I think the Crosstrek has more punch than any of my previous ones.
It also rides more smooth and quiet.

<br><br>
UPDATE:  After 3 yrs I'm still very happy with this car.  I have always felt safe and secure with the Crosstrek's handling on snow and ice.  Complaints about the paint are legit.  All my door handles have slight stratches, but they are not that noticeable.   Had problems with a check engine light due to gas cap.  Problem went away when I stopped purchasing 87 octane gas and moved up to 89.  Toddler car seats fit well, reverse facing infant car seats will only fit in the middle (which is safer anyway). Other than those minor problems, I am still in love with this car.  What I love most is it's versatility.  Whether you are dropping kids off for school or hauling rocks the Crosstrek can do it all.  Purchased roof rack rails and cargo carrier for long trips & that worked very well.  Next week I'm installing a hitch for our bike rack!  I'm very pleased!

Main reason was for carrying my dog and for future family family vehicle.
I tested the equinox, mazda cx-5, and nissan rogue.

And i know plenty of my friends with wrx's and sti's and they praise subaru.
I have to say the car has been living up to the hype sofar.

roads.I drove it on forest roads I'd never take the Impreza on & it did great. I can tow a motorcycle over rocks with this thing. Handles great,more truck-like. The heated seats are height adjustable which allows me to sit lower & not have the Impreza's mirror block vision on right curves(was dangerous on the Impreza). This auto transmission doesn't have near the ""holdback"" going down hills the Impreza's had(I had to gas that the Impreza going down hills--hated it). "

I bought this vehicle in late October of 2012 and have been happy ever since.
Always get comments about my wheels.
MPG runs 28 (city) to 33 (hwy).
The heated seats are excellent; the a/c freezes me out; the speakers are upgraded ones and are perfect.
If there is a complaint it is a little sluggish when a/c is on and I need to get moving quickly.
When you are backing up - you need to leave your foot on the brake until you feel the car engage into drive or it will drift a little backwards. Other than that - wonderful vehicle and would recommend to anyone and everyone!"
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,Cameron, 01/25/2018,Such a love/hate relationship,4,"First off, we love our subie. She gets us where we need to go. Never complains and never fails to do so. I'll admit, I graduated from the Subaru class of the early 2000s when the engines were crap and I wanted to drive the car off a cliff for the insurance money. I was hesitant to get anther but my wife insisted that we get something safe and reliable. Alas, we settled on a 2013 certified pre-owned and have been more than pleased. Sure, it has its quirks. MPG is not the greatest but we live in the city. On the highway she purrs like a kitten and gets us roughly 30-32 MPG. Bear in mind that we use non-ethanol gas. We had a funky issue with a brake light sensor going out and it totally confused the brain of the car and wouldn't let us shift out of park. However, I took it to the dealership and they knew right away what the issue was and resolved quickly. There could definitely be more legroom for a 6'1"" 250lb dude but my wife fits in perfectly. It does blow my mind there is no cargo light in the trunk. The hate part is that their expensive to maintain. Will be buy another crosstrek? bet your <span style=""color: rgb(38, 50, 56); font-family: Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; white-space: normal;"">[non-permissible content removed]</span> we will. The 2018s are good lookin. For now, we're not ready to retire 2013. She's got 75,000 miles and still runnin' like a champ.

**Update 2019**
The older and more miles she got on her, it was a bit of a nightmare. The CVT would jump, rattle, etc... the engine I could tell was getting exhausted (no pun intended). It was a great car. We loved her and she drove us across the country at one point. It became too evident that these first gen XVs just had some spacial and internal issues that never got resolved.

The manual says this is normal for a boxer engine. I've had many boxer engines & NONE of the others ate oil. It also eats the right rear tire. You have to buy AWD tires in groups of 4, so this is expensive. I sorta like the car & love the look, but my old vw bug had more pep. Both have manual trans. Seriously considering trading it in.

I am quite disappointed by the car after only having it about six weeks. I am barely getting 20 mpg, far less than advertised, and one of the major reasons I purchased this car. I do find the engine extremely loud and bothersome but again, this may be characteristic of a Subaru? I feel it definitely lacks power but I was willing to sacrifice that for decent mpg, which is why I am frustrated beyond belief.
I would seriously reconsider purchasing another and yet I realize that anyone I know that's owned a Subaru, loves them."
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,pete141, 01/01/2013,Fun & Economical,4,Am new to the Subaru line - was intrigued by the looks of the Crosstrek. Didn't look like a station wagon or any of the other suv-ish crossovers out on the market today. Lots of pick-up when accelerating onto the highway & changing lanes-enough for my needs anyways. Highway ride is smooth. Have not had to fill the tank yet so can't comment on the gas mileage - although am hoping that it comes in around the advertised 25-28 range for mostly city driving. The AWD did well in the recent wintry mix of a few inches. Never lost traction and went up hills with no problems at all.

I even removed the spare tire and jack and rear cargo and floor mats to reduce weight. The dealer says there is nothing wrong with it and is probably my driving.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,luism2013, 11/18/2014,Don't bother buying,3,"Car consumes way to much oil for a brand new car.  Never thought I would spend so much on just oil.  Spend more time getting oil for the car then I do getting gas.  My oil light came on right after I purchased the vehicle and had the dealer see what was wrong they said it was just low. After topping it off I began my trip home and on an empty  road the oil light came on had to drive it several hundred me to get oil. Took it in to a dealer and say the car normally burns 1 quart every 1200 miles.  You do an oil change every 7000 miles that's 5-6 quarts of oil at 10 bucks a quart. Never had any problems. So with other vehicles first and last subaru I personally buy.  Also the car over revs.

About 1 year and some change the transmission started acting up it would shift so we took it in and luckily the recall on the transmission happen so we got it replaced, this was about mid 2017.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,Maxwell Subatarian, 04/01/2016,Three years in a CrossTrek,3,"I leased mine in winter of 2013 and recently turned it in rather than buying it. The CrossTrek is an OK car with good attributes and flaws. On snow it is ok, but not great. With the OEM tires, it was terrible here in northern Michigan. I added a set of Bridgestone Blizzaks which significantly improved traction. But the car is lightweight with makes it prone to sliding around even with awd and winter tires. I did appreciate the car's interior. The firm seats are great and help up over three years and 34,000 miles. There is a surprising amount of room in the passenger compartment, but not too much in the back with the rear seat up. The engine was always very loud on acceleration and got very noisy after about 30k miles - sounded like ball bearings in a coffee can.  This is one issue. Subaru needs to put a far more powerful engine in this car. The little 2.0liter, 150HP engine is way under-powered for this car. Mechanically, only a few minor problems the dealer took care of. Big issue was concerns over safety. I nailed a 150 pound deer head-on at 45 miles per hour and the damage to the car was immense ($13,500 bill). The entire front end of the car (bumper, fenders, hood, roof, windshield, lights, numerous engine components due to the battery rupturing) needed to be replaced. It folded up like tinfoil. After that I never felt safe in the car. The sloping front end of the car threw the deer into the windshield in on the front of the roof denting it. Regardless of how many airbags it has one cannot beat the laws of physics. I dreaded the possibility of hitting a truck or large car. That's why it gone. Would not buy another one. If you want a Subaru, go with the bigger ones.

Thus far, I have 16,000 miles of mostly highway driving (probably a 75/25 split) and am averaging 32-33 MPG with the automatic transmission.
Though it doesn't have exceptional power or acceleration. what do you expect from a 4 cylinder motor?
While the synthetic oil is certainly more expensive, you don't need to change oil except every 7,500 miles (some say 10,000 miles).
This makes it roughly comparable to annual oil costs with regular oil.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,rivernsnow, 12/18/2014,Updated Review,5,"Almost 5 1/2 years June 2018 (original review Feb 2013) I'm loving my XV. The jittery steering calmed down after 1-2 months. Handles great in rain downpours. Driving onto beaches to launch kayaks has been easy when other cars spin wheels. Had enough power at altitude (8,000 Ft.). Does lack power with AC on. Front seats very comfortable. Wife complains rear seats are uncomfortable when sitting back there with our son.  Mileage still not as advertised. 25 average MPG on 89 Octane. Minus' are still that power locking automatically actives alarm and paint/clearcoat scratches much too easily. and rear seats need to be more comfortable.    Update June 2016 Still happy with & enjoying my XV. I do suspect it is using too much oil. I'm hearing this is an issue Subaru doesn't have an easy fix for. Dealer gave me a free oil change so they could check it after 1500 miles. They said - no problem. About the time my next oil change was due, the oil light came on. Car was down over a quart. More oil consumption than I see in my other vehicles. December 2017. Almost 4 years old and 55K. Still running great. Have not noted any more oil consumption issues. Wish they had put a lock on the rear hatch and passenger door. It's annoying not having those. It would also be nice if there was venting for air and heat to the rear seats. It's hard to get the right temperature to rear seat passengers. Only safety complaint is the placement of the rear view mirror. It is too low on the window for a taller person and creates a significant blind spot on the right side - front. June 2018 - This car has been very dependable, But selling it now for a Forester because I need more family / luggage space. Got 30+ MPG on recent 1/1/2 to 3 hour road trips using 87 octane. Have NOT had any more oil consumption issues. Complaints still are auto alarming when using power locks, Low mirror height causing a blind spot to right front for taller people (I'm 6'3"") and no dedicated air venting for rear passengers. Come on Subaru how hard is it to run a vent to the back !!! This should be standard on even base model Subarus

Noticed the oil was low on the very first oil change which I do myself.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,rondo320, 06/19/2013,wind noise,3,"Do not buy this vehicle if you plan to drive on highways at 75 mph or above.
At that speed with a headwind or crosswind you will get a horrendous noise that seems to be coming from the headliner.
Listening to this for several hours on the highway will require you to reassess the wisdom of driving a Crosstrek on a road trip.
The dealer can't duplicate it because the speed limit in the vicinity is 65 mph and the noise is at 75 or above.
Thanks a lot Subaru! Nothing but Subarus since 1982 but that is going to change.
Update: Had to replace my windshield because a rock hit it.  No more noise.  It was the original windshield seal that was defective and caused the noise.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,carscientious, 01/11/2013,Interior options,2," The Crosstrek ""limited"" offers only two stereo head units-the standard unit w/o Satellite capability and the NAV system with SAT. As satellite users for several years, we made a dreadful mistake in buying this SUV without making sure the ""Limited"" version had SAT.
Adding a mobile car unit is ""cheesy"" and takes up more room especially if you have a ""Garmin"" on the dash. An aftermarket unit can be quite pricey and can range $500-$1800 including installation.
Our local Subaru dealer quoted $4500 for a new Subaru factory NAV system if available and requiring a new antenna if wiring is possible. Would have given up leather seats for cloth in order to get SAT.

But first, there are some things to like about this car.
The stereo and blue tooth work well.
The all wheel drive is nice.
Ok, I'm out.
Really, my disappointment in this car boils down to one single thing: a 200 lb tongue weight limit on the trailer hitch.
The thing is pictured in marketing materials with trailer hitch bike racks, etc.
But a 200 lb limit?
That's like a rack and maybe 2 bikes.
Forget cargo carriers.
I had 300 lbs on my Honda Accord and I thought that was whimpy, but really who puts a trailer hitch on an Accord (besides me)?
As boring as the CRV was, I'm kinda wishing for a little Honda back in my life."
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,Dumbsubiowner , 09/22/2019,Save your money and get a better car,1," Gutless! This car has absolutely no powe- screams going up a hill if you try to use the “paddle shifter “and turn a corner there’s no way of shifting because the paddle shifters are nowhere to be found. The sun is constantly in my eyes the visors only cover 1/2 of the windshield? And no expanders,  super good engineering .   I have light beige cloth seats that if you even look at them they get stained. Seriously if you get water on them it looks like the biggest coffee stain ever all seats look totally thrashed after about two months .  If you turn the  ignition off, but have an open the doors your windows won’t work ( cheapest feature out there?) the radio is a  piece of crap, the knobs inside are all cheap and look like they wouldn’t hold up for very many years .   Very difficult to unlatch the hood to check the engine compartment . 
 On the upside it doesn’t hydroplane in the rain or water puddles .  I would sure like my money back toward another vehicle that doesn’t have all the issues I think I d take hydroplaning over the issues that I can’t stand in this thing. Also the trunk window doesn’t go down but I guess they didn’t make that feature in this car ( again cheap)

Unfortunately, the Crosstrek disappoints. We recently made a trip in ny we encountered snowy roads and icy spots. This car fishtails every time you hit an icy spot to the point where you believe you will spin out and  constantly makes you feel out of control. It has a floaty feeling like the car is unstable. It is unsafe to have to be doing 40 on thruway a with blinkers on when you are being passed by Camrys and all other SUVs which appear to be in perfect control. This car is just scary to drive on snowy roads! I don't know if it is the cvt or the tires. In any event we will trade"

I'm only getting 27MPG avg. I thought I'd do better. Sometimes when I put it in drive it takes 15 seconds or more to actually Go. When I first start it (even when it's not cold) it's rather loud and rattles. The stereo is not user friendly at all. I wish I had up graded but I didn't want to spend another $1000 for a navigation system I didn't want. The standard speakers just don't sound good.

While an initial test drive MIGHT convince you to buy the Crosstrek -- you get bored and frustrated will quickly as you drive around your neighborhood.
While you might enjoy the 8.7"" ground clearance-try wearing a baseball cap and putting the visor down. If the seat is forward or up, it can't be done. Same goes for tall people. Taking the head rest off the passenger side - even with an open moonroof, can't be done. They need to add 3"" to height - which might also help with cooling the car: the angle of the windshield causes higher heat from sun buildup-making AC less efficient."

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,seattlexv, 06/18/2013,Really Disappointed in MPG,3,"This is my first Subaru.
I was very excited about the Crosstrek as it had all of the great features of the Outback with better gas mileage and a bit smaller.
Perfect I thought.
I am pleased with the car except for the gas mileage.
I purchased this car over the Honda CRV because of the mpg ratings.
At first the gas mileage was about 28mgg which is advertised.
But since then and with 8,000 miles on the car, I am getting 23mpg and it continues to drop with each tank of gas.

I took it to the dealer and they can't find anything wrong with it and said to contact Subaru America which has been frustrating.

Have others experienced this type of problem?

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,Erin Wallace, 01/08/2017,Subaru Crosstrek XV,4,"I love this car.  It's more handleable than the 2005 Subaru Outback Legacy it replaced for us.  It's solid and quick.  Acceleration is a little hesitant, surprisingly, but it has been really cold here since we purchased it.  The only truly disappointing thing has been that the heater is noisy enough that we have to raise our voices to hear each other and/or the radio when it is on high.  That seems like a ridiculous problem that could have been engineered differently.  Otherwise, we are in love.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,CC, 01/17/2017,Wish I had considered this purchase more carefully,3,"While I liked the appearance and style of this small crossover, it is not nearly at the level I expect from a car so well considered by so many. What do they see in this car that I do not? Far from spacious, there is not much room in here. It is not very comfortable to drive, even with the premium leather interior, no where to rest your elbows really. There is a very flimsy layer of carpet in the trunk area, carries over when you fold the seats down, the carpet actually sags on the support bars. The leather is also paper thin on the arm rest and already ripped. The loud ungodly blowers of the heating/air climate control system are terrible and I can't make business calls when I am driving because of the background noise. I wind up saying what?? the whole time. This is a hard pill to swallow. The 33 MPG highway...sounds super inflated and I have never see milage that good, even though 80% of my driving is on the highway. The worst thing about this car is how I work out of my trunk and I can not see anything at night...never even gave it a thought about how important A LIGHT WOULD BE in a trunk, nor did I ever think to check really when I bought it...a hatchback with no light in the back!!! It's a bizarre shortcut. It annoys me to no end that I need a flashlight to prepare for my day/bring product for work in and out of the car. Why did Subaru make a car with no interior hatch lighting? It is not going to win any races, but I could live with that if it had great gas milage. I had a Volvo XC previously, so when other reviews said this car is great in the snow...I believed them. Not so,  I have had more white knuckled trips in this feather weight...not to mention you need running speed to make it up hills since it is so light. My Volvo could have pushed this little guy up the hills! It ate snowstorms and spit them out. Bottom line: I'm not a big believer in reviews after reading this car's. Did I mention the paint will come off if you lean against it? It had 2 large rust spots on the roof already before it hit 40k, and chips all over it that I had a detailer fill. He said he filled 55 chip marks, pebbles on the road take the paint off this car. So disappointing. Can't wait to unload it.  Sorry Subaru, this is a fail.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2013,S Briggs, 12/08/2020,What I thought was a dream is a nightmare!,1,"At first I absolutely loved my purchase. Great in snow, rain etc. My car had no problems in any weather condition. Took it on all kinds of adventures with my Dog and husband. The seats fold down flat so with tetris skills you can fit a surprising amount in it. 
In 2018 I started to hear a buzzing sound when driving, shortly after a screeching sound when I turned. Took it in and had a barring replaced but the buz sound was still there. Less then a year later, buzzing and screeching sound, took it in and had another barring fixed. I could still hear a buz months later and it seemed worse, took it in and they replaced a belt. Had a notice for some recall work so I took it and asked if they could check they sound and they said everything was fine. Months later again I was in another 2013 trek with less km's, no sound. At the time my assembly plate had also caused my key to get stuck sometimes so I took it in again and asked them to check the buz. This time I was informed that I needed a new transmission, warranty covers up to 160,000 km, I am 163,000 so sol. I called Subaru Canada and was told that even if I was 1 km over they wouldn't do anything. If you have one sell it back to a dealer. If you are looking to buy... don't. Side note, second Subaru I have owned to jave the Transmission go, first lasted longer and was older but clearly there is an issue they are not addressing. Fool me once, fool me twice, don't buy a Subaru.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,holderad, 01/27/2014,I Love THIS car!,5,"I love my 2014 Plasma Green Crosstrek Hybrid. My one word description: Awesome! The hybrid system works significantly better than any hybrid I test drove. It is used for power / torque augmentation more than fully powering the car most of the time. I think Subaru under-reported their MPG figures on purpose. The car is not even broken in, and I'm getting almost 38 MPG highway and so far about 31.7 MPG with downtown driving. The car does some kinda magic with the CVT and that electric motor. It is seamless. The car has ""the pull"" at all speeds that it's all gas brother just doesn't. I mean, you can feel the surge at highway speeds when you stand on it to pass. The symmetrical AWD is fantastic!"
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,antiquity, 10/27/2013,Just what I was looking for,4,"Lots of ""compact"" SUVs out there, and almost all of them are boring and bland.
While no drag racer, this car is fun to drive, has exciting styling, and is just the right size.
Also, it has a unique look and size that isn't quite an SUV, more like a sports wagon/SUV cross.

You get a lot for the money - heated leather seats, Navigation, moonroof, backup camera - compared to other cars.
Plus, the raised clearance, cool wheels, and great gas mileage (at at 27 MPG mostly on short trips and city driving).
The drive feels very secure, and the shift paddles are fun to use.
The engine does rev high and won't get you 0 - 60 in a record time, but the car feels punchy, spry, and turns on a dime."

As a real estate agent I wanted something nice but didn't want to go the standard issue luxury car everyone seems to drive. When a family member recommended the forester, I wasn't thrilled but went to test drive it anyway. While at the dealership I saw this little beauty and fell in love. I can cart around my clients and all my signs/lockboxes/excess Realtor stuff. But its also very comfortable and safe feeling. Being able to sit up high is a plus when you drive 20k miles a year.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,t krause, 04/17/2016,Turns out looks really aren't everything,3,"I was sold on the look of this car and Subaru's reputation. My experience was rather poor. The battery died every few months. Subaru couldn't find anything wrong. If they'd told me that they put in a low-quality battery and it was a common problem then maybe I'd have believed them and kept the car. They then suspected a faulty remote start - that they had installed when I bought it. It was at the dealership for about 2 weeks - when I finally just asked them what they'd give me for it is when they really started trying to fix it (mind you I had it for 2 years and it only had about 7600 miles on it). The other cons are minor: the radio quality was noticeably poor when the heat or air conditioner was running because the noise from the blower was so loud. A great sound system wasn't something I really cared about, but the noise from the blower was so loud you couldn't hear any sound from the radio at all when the heat/air was on. You had to put the heat/air at full blast in order to get a comfortable temperature inside the car. The most distressing problem was when you would shift from reverse into drive. There was a strange delay that I've never experienced in another car. When it was ready it would ""pop"" and the acceleration was faster than you were expecting. It just had a weird feeling to it, not smooth.

It is quiet, and the steering has good feedback without being overly stiff.
It also has a nice exterior look.
Traction has been great.
As far as the mileage, it has been disappointing.
It has averaged about 27 MPG.

Also very noisy at highway speeds...can't listen easily to my audio books. 

Finally, some of these problems might be tolerable if the MPG was better than 23 using 87 octane. The service  person said the computer says 26 MPG ??and it's winter."

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,fried003, 02/13/2014,not very hybridy - updated,3,"The sticker only claimed 31mpgs, so it's close to what was expected - admittedly I never looked at the MPGs, mostly just the price
The car barely gets 30mpg; not much better than my 2008 Forester.  Like many car companies, Subaru wanted a ""Hybrid"" in their line-up.
So they picked the Crosstrek & jeri-rigged it as a hybrid, though it was never really designed as real hybrid, like a Prius. Any Prius is a hybrid.
Otherwise
it's decent enough/comfortable.
I got the touring model, which has all the bells & whistles, some of which I don't understand, such as the entertainment system.
The touch screen for the navigation system/entertainment system is clunky.
After 5 years of ownership, the only repair needed was to replace a strut, and two batteries - the ""normal"" battery in any car + another one that restarts the engine when the car is in idle (at a stoplight).  This latter battery, one of two that are only part of the hybrid system, is very expensive & not covered by the longer engine/transmission warranty.  This is not the battery that can power the car, it's a smaller battery used only for re-starting the car.
Since buying it, Subaru upped the oil change interval from 7,500 to 6,000 (upped, meaning more frequent change).
The engine is a 2.0L - to me, it's very under-powered, especially living in a hilly area.  I think the literature has it as 148 horse power -  that's like a pony.
A real oddity is that the doors don't lock automatically when the gas pedal is depressed.
But it has everything I'd ever want in a vehicle + other stuff.
But, so far, it's not fulling the primary expectation of better gas mileage than a ""regular"" car.

NOTE - the hybrid seems to have been dis-continued as of 2017, so it must not have sold well & I can see why.  A decent car, but not a good hybrid.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,tradedcmax, 04/06/2014,I traded this in due a problem never fixed,3,"UPDATE:  We really loved our Crosstrek, in bright orange, but after driving it for a little bit, I noticed my arm was sore.  I didn't really understand why.  But I figure it out.  It was pulling to the right, constantly, upon any acceleration.  As a car guy, I remember torque steer; it was just like torque steer but obvious at all levels of acceleration.  The dealer could not fix it.  The techs of course denied it happening.  But I went and tried a brand new one (this was new too) and no torque steer.  So the dealer basically traded it in for this one and put this broken one on the lot as a non-certified pre owned.  I was happy but I felt bad for whomever bought it after me.  

Anyway, the replacement was fine, until someone stole the wheels and tires off of it while it sat in front of my house.....those are some nice wheels.  And after that, I started driving it at I95 rush hour traffic and found it could not handle the speed of I95 with as much grace as it should; it felt wonky.   So, I traded it in on a a competitor's SUV.  I am so happy I did this, despite losing some cash along the way.  

The other problems that surfaced were on the 2nd one, if you had the heater in the bi-level mode, the engine would run rough like it was going to stall.  All other modes were okay.  The engine is a 60K tune up interval.   When cold it had a very fast idle.  Reminded me of something from the 80's, fast idle.  

Those things said, I also had major problems with my feet hurting after driving for awhile......at 5' 11"", I could not stretch out my legs as I would on other cars.  That turned out to be a bigger problem that anticipated.   And also, the cargo area was smaller than I first realized.  My fault for not renting one for a week first, but they are hard to find as rentals.  

So, it turns out that these weren't as good as originally anticipated, but probably for many, it would be fine.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,Frustrated Subaru owner, 05/18/2016,Subaru Crosstrek Hybred: Total Lemon?,1,"After having a Toyota for over 10 years then a Honda CRV for over 10 years with no issues, my husband and I decided to purchase a a Subaru Crosstrek Hybred 2014 which looks good on the outside (but BIG MISTAKE). By January 2015 a message appeared in the dash board whenever I started the car that said(check hill star assist). At my first service, I told the service people and they told me they did not find anything wrong, nor saw the message. I continued to drive the car with the message appearing on and off when finally in November/December 2015 more messages appeared and check engine light appeared and stayed on all the time. I made an appointment to get the car checked in November, this time they told me they fixed it and the lights went away. Within a few months after they told me they (fixed it) the messages reappeared and I brought the car back in March for them to ""fix"" again. I waited for about an hour and they called me and told me they fixed the problem and the messages and lights were gone. As soon as I turned on the car and try to drive off all the lights and messages reappeared, I called the service person who took the car and said they were going to check it again. After waiting for over an hour they finally told me they there was a transmission control cover problem and they would have to keep the car until June 2015 because they had to order the part.  In the middle of April after not receiving an update from Subaru, I finally called and after a few choice words with the manager they told me the car will be ready at the end of April. On April Friday 29, 2015 I received a call from Subaru and they told me they changed the transmission control cover and the lights went away and every thing was fine. So I picked up the car that same day (Friday April 29, 2015). By Sunday May 1 (2 days after picking up the car) those lights that they claimed went away reappeared. I had to take the car back (May 2) and am still waiting May 17, 2015 for word on what is the problem. At this point I am very ANGRY at the run around. I got the warranty which I am using for now to ""fix"" the car but what is going to happen when it runs out.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,Evelyn, 05/12/2016,Good car.. poor warrantee service from Subaru,3,"Fun ride. After 2 years this car handles well in winter. Too small for 2 kids. Fits as much luggage as a midsize car. Subaru service departments fight hard to avoid covering anything that is covered under the extended Subaru Care warrantee. I am getting rid of it soon while mileage is low for that reason alone.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,Anne, 06/28/2019,Never going to buy a Subaru again,1,"Never again will I buy from Subaru. Got the car because they're supposed to be reliable and easy to work on. At 65,000 miles, both front CV axles went out. Air conditioner went out at 55k and has a known defect, which Subaru won't recall or make right. The part alone costs upward of a grand. Brake light switch went bad the first year I had it, I paid to replace it myself. The recall didn't go out until 2019. Car absolutely eats oil. Great concept, absolutely dismal build quality. Subaru has long since left behind its reputation of selling reliable, well-built cars.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,Daniel S., 08/30/2016,Not Feeling the Subaru Love!,1,"I purchased the Crosstrek Hybrid based on winter handling performance and recommendations from family members who have owned multiple Subarus (but not this model).  In the past, I've owned other AWD/4WD vehicles, including a Nissan Pathfinder, Nissan X-Terra, Jeep Cherokee and Toyota RAV-4.  My Crosstrek is the worst performer of the bunch.  While I can't speak for the standard Crosstrek, the hybrid places the heavy battery components in the back, which changes performance dynamics IMHO. The first thing I noticed was the horrible winter braking.  The car just slides and doesn't stop (even with new Michelin All-Season tires).  As for hugging the road, the car has a tendency to hop and skip with any imperfection in the road.  Sometimes I feel like the car is catching air.  You just don't feel like the car is sure-footed in bad conditions.  My girlfriend has a 2WD Honda CR-V, and she thinks it handles much better.  I think the Crosstrek is too light and I think the battery in the back is affecting performance. I have other gripes too.  The Crosstrek eats tires, even with long tread-rated tires and even after proper balance and alignment.  With the Hybrid, you can't get a trail hitch because of the back battery placement. The Bluetooth really stinks and takes 4-5 tries before connecting with an iPhone. Even when driving the speed limit and gently, the car doesn't come close to stated MPG.  Most of the time I'm at 23-26 MPG.  This is a hybrid for heaven's sake?  Lastly, I question the electronics.  The first week I had this car ""new"", the check engine light came on and the dealership needed to re-program something to fix it.  It took them a few days and I had to rent a car, which they never reimbursed me for. Occasionally the passenger ""check airbag"" light comes on, but then it's fine for a few months.  The car doesn't look bad.  And it's somewhat comfortable on the inside.  Fit and finish are not bad.  Rear cargo space is tiny - so you'll need a roof shell for any family vacation.  But winter performance is where the rubber meets the road - and the Hybrid Crosstrek falls way short. I will never ever buy a Subaru again and am definitely not feeling the Subaru love.

I grew tired of temperamental turbos, having too much power in slow traffic, and spending ungodly sums of cash fueling them up.
 

I just needed a reliable AWD vehicle that can get me around in the mountains throughout the winter months, ground clearance,
get good fuel economy, and can stand up to my outdoorsy lifestyle.

So far, I have 1000 miles and have been very impressed with this vehicle.
I find it very peppy, and find the 145 hp rating deceiving.
This climbs up mountain roads feeling sprightly, and never gives even a hint of losing steam.
At 75 mph, I get about 30-32 mpg.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,K White, 11/20/2015,Don't Be Fooled by the Stylish Appearance,2,"I bought my 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek with 25k on it in January. At first, it was a great little car. For someone who lives in Vermont, a Subaru was almost a way of life, which is what drove me to purchase my Crosstrek. About two weeks after purchasing it was when I noticed my first problem with it, it shook so uncontrollably bad on the interstate that I had to pull over, turn the vehicle off and restart it. It was not long after that when all of the problems started to occur. My car now decides when the radio plays and when it does not, the automatic drivers window does not work anymore, the car skips and shakes when going down the road. Not to mention, how loud the motor is. Overall, my car sounds and feels like it is going to blow up when I drive down the road. I have not even had my car for a year and I am already ready to get something new due to how bad my car is. Unfortunately for me, I put $9500 down on it between my trade-in and down payment and to trade it in, would result in me ""taking a bath"" in my car. So it looks like I am stuck with it for another two or three years. This is not a vehicle I would recommend purchasing, don't be fooled by the stylish appearance.

The car had strong steering pull to the RIGHT. The dealership attempted to fix the car, but was unable to do so.
The service adviser and technician told us that they have been having frequent steering problems with this model car. They wanted to have a Subaru engineer come out, so I requested the alignment specs. The alignment was intentionally set to cause the car to pull LEFT to ""correct"" the problem, but it still pulled RIGHT. The dealer offered us a different Crosstek, which had the same problem after test driving it.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,Scott, 12/21/2016,"Things that make yoy say, Hmm",4,"I have put some 60k miles on her and this is a review , I have owned 4x Subarus and some 40 cars  in my life. I do alot of outdoors activity and bring along the dogs as much as possible, so for that that it is pretty good, the MPG is about 24 City and 34 Highway, which is really good when compared to the SUVs in the area, the car handles well in braking, corner and such in the mountains, I travel to Smokey Mnt., about 3 times a year and I am also a Kayaker, which I have to get in and out of some tough places with the SUV, the ground clearance really come in, alot of mud holes, muddy and general soft ground she does well in. I have disappointed in alot of things about the SUV, items that are stock on others in this area are not in the Crosstrek, example, turning blinkers on the side on the car or mirros, none, with a company that prides itself on safety this should be on there, as to avoid a wreck, is best to see the other car and what its intentions are. The interior is really cheap, no lights on the mirrors overhead on the sun visor, chair material seems to stain very easy, carpet is like a felt, very thin, hard to clean, everything sticks to it, I would suggest seat covers, the radio only hold 1 Bluetooth link,( one cellphone), so if my wife wants to drive it, she has to delete my settings and put hers in, she as a Legency which this is not an issue with. Know the Engine and transmission, I will say that it is very lacking, even in the small mountians of the Smokeys there is a real issue, the car has a hard time going uphill with the automatic transmission, even when using the paddle shifters, there is just so little pickup, that you have to allow more time for passing, or if you need power in an emergency, it is not there. I have checked on performance upgrades for the engine, there are none to this date. My brother is looking at a Subaru now, I would him Forester XT, it has the WRX engine, so when you need power it is there. CVT takes a few minutes to warm up and you can not go over 4k rpm, so either you have to let it idel until ready of drive less than 4k rpms. I would not buy another CrossTrek with the CVT and 2.0i engine, I am looking at selling it this spring, will go with Forester XT.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,Chris C, 03/30/2018,Keeping my fingers crossed,4,"I purchased mine brand new in 2014. It has 8 miles on it out of the showroom. I live and work in NYC and have had to deal with every possible condition that you could encounter driving in new york. I have driven with ease and confidence in every blizzard we have had here since I purchased the car. Around town and at city speeds my XV is super quick and agile. that 0-25 mph range is key for city driving and where i think this car shines.  On the highway, despite reviews I've read before and after buying this car, acceleration isn't terrible. I believe that for the average driver its just fine. Having said that, there have been less than a handful of times where I would be merging into highway traffic and the engine would just make a lot of noise but barely get the car up to speed. There have also been times where I would merge under the same circumstances and it would go like a bat out of hell. The engine/transmission in this car have a lot of character. I've had to learn to know what to expect from it under any given situation. it will not always act the same but if you pay attention you can use your familiarity with the vehicles' throttle response to get it to do what you need. It also helps having an understanding of this cars limitations. Understand this is not a race car and is not sporty by any sense of the word. The only issues I have had with my crosstrek is that I've replaced or patched every single one of my tires. Not necessarily Subarus fault. The cabin is loud at highway speeds but no more than similarly priced cars of the same year in my opinion. Gas mileage has been good considering its full time awd, but obviously below that of a equally spec'd FWD car. My warranty just expired so im hoping nothing starts to go wrong all of a sudden. This car has been nothing short of fantastically reliable and I hope it continues to be.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,Robert Dorsey II, 02/12/2016,Subaru Crosstrek - A must have with Eyesight!,5,"We were not in the market for a ""new"" vehicle.  But we wound up with a 7500 mile Certified Pre-Owned 2015 Subaru XV Crosstrek with their amazing Eyesight package (and this was why), which is essentially new.  The car was a former service fleet loaner, so it was in great shape with low mileage with an attractive price.  It and the two others they had were the only used Subarus in the entire Metro area that had the Eyesight package.  I looked at over 300 different vehicles listed online as well as contacted about seven Subaru dealers, and none of them had any pre-owned with Eyesight.  To find this package in a pre-owned, you will probably have to buy new unless you wait until 2017.
<br><br>
The Crosstrek as a whole is a great vehicle (a little smaller than our former Kia Sportage), but I will focus this review on Eyesight, as there are a million generic reviews about the Crosstrek itself.  So in short: It is all of the things you have heard about: good for small families, reliable, safe, and good for its symmetrical AWD.  I can't speak about the electronics other than Eyesight (bluetooth, etc), because I don't really use them or care about them.  The only minus is it lacks some acceleration, which I doubt will ever really matter to most drivers.
<br><br>
Subaru Eyesight is a technology that they install on vehicles ($1,250 retail value, I think) that uses two front-facing cameras to help the driver in emergency situations as well as control the vehicle's adaptive cruise control.  Eyesight will help you both break and decelerate if you need it.  It also will send audible alerts of various situations which are both convenient and a significant safety upgrade.  Both my wife and I are new drivers and find this very reassuring, though I think anyone would appreciate it the same.  I encourage anyone in the market for a new car to look into this technology: it is fantastic (and the 2016's have an upgraded version that includes blind-spot detection!)!
<br><br>
While we have not had the car long enough to thoroughly test everything, the adaptive cruise control was a major plus, and only comes with the Eyesight package.  It will intelligently cruise for you at any predetermined maximum speed, and slow down if the traffic in front of you gets too close/slow.  It keeps a distance of 2, 1.5, or 1 seconds behind the vehicle in front of you, and informs you with tones when it has ""locked in"" on a vehicle.  Imagine how strange it is to feel your vehicle brake, decelerate, and come to a full halt without touching the pedals (if it comes to a full stop, you get a tone, and about a seconds warning before the cruise control shuts off and the car will idle forward).  The future is here!
<br><br>
If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive SUV that will ride nicely, carry enough, and protect you, your family, and your dog, then the Crosstrek may be the right choice for you.  The Special Edition that is coming out later in 2016 sounds very attractive with lane-change assist and some more advanced auto-driving technologies.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,Steve, 12/06/2016,"WARNING, DO NOT BUY CROSSTREK",1,"WARNING, DO NOT buy a Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid or a Crosstrek due to VERY POOR QUALITY.

Subaru IS NOT building Hybrid models any longer because the hybrid system is faulty after 2016.

What does this mean? Repair costs will be high. Parts will be expensive. Long wait times since technicians no longer need to be certified so there will be less technicians available to fix your car.

There is a critical fault in the hybrid motor that will cost you $1,000s and these issues will persist

Our car only has 56k miles and it's been in the shop for 2 months. They also replaced the driver's seat because the metal frame was sticking thru the leather? Poor quality.

We bought a new 2014 Crosstrek hybrid for $31k, 2.7 years ago.

Today, 5 Dec 2016, Subaru offered $12,500 for the trade-in? This car depreciates fast. YOU WILL LOSE $12,000 if you buy new after the first year and $19,000 after (2) years. Meanwhile, they get rich.

Subaru is not the Subaru we once knew. They are making cheap products that break more often and the car no longer holds the value it once did.

PLEASE MAKE A SMART DECISION. It's your money.  And they don't care about it.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,Mr. Vic, 08/17/2015,So far so good!,5,"I wanted something a little less expensive and easy at the pump, this car did not disappoint.  The seats could have a bit more support and the stock tires aren't the best but after 25,000 miles those are my only complaints.  I love the way it looks and it laughs at snow.  I average around 26 around town and over 31 on the highway.  No repairs as of yet.
<br><br>
I'm over 30,000 miles now and I'm still very happy.   The heated seats are awesome and my brakes are like new.

I've reached 39,000 miles with no problems.  The front brakes pads are large and still original.  I replaced the back brakes about a thousand miles ago.  Other than routine maintenance there have been no problems.  I still really like this car.


I'm now approaching 50,000 miles and this car is still great.  Other than one set of brakes and two sets of tires this car has been flawless.  My oldest learned to drive with this car and my second child will be driving this summer.  It is a perfect car to teach a new driver.  Not too powerful and great traction and visibility.  I will say that my 3rd set of tires are very cheap Walmart Douglas tires.  They are far better than the original tires, which is the only complaint I can think of with this car.  I still get about 25 mpg in town and about 32 on the hwy.

A few thousand more miles. The Douglas tires are awesome.  Still running well.  Child number two just started driving and this car has been extremely easy for him to learn on.  Subaru extended the transmission warranty to 100,000 miles.  That's what a real company does, stands behind the product.

The car is now 6 years old and approaching 70,000 miles.  Still no repairs.  I replaced the rotors and brakes this year and it was a pretty simple job.  There is a little rust on the front door sills that I'm going to get painted.  Otherwise we have loved this car.  Child one and two have learned to drive with this car and child three will this summer.  I'm seriously thinking that this may be my current 8 year old's first car in 8 years.

So far I like almost everything about the car. I'm not too impressed with the gas mileage. I average 25 MPG but I figure that's not too bad for an AWD. My major complaint
is that the radio seems to be outdated in this car as it is not compatible with any of the I-Phones (even my already outdated 4S). I've rented 2012 and 2013 cars and have always been able to control my I-Phone through the USB port but it's not gonna' happen in this car. Very disappointed."

I don't understand the comment about the audio speakers. My Forester had a VERY upgraded Jensen system and the factory Crosstrek speakers beat that to infinity. I love everything about this car. I chose the Crosstrek because Subaru keeps making the models larger. The new Forester is the same size as the old Outback. The new Outback is a behemoth to me. Anyway . . .the interior is great, the ammenities are great, the styling is great. My only two downs are: the turning radius is a bit less and the visibility is a bit less (the Forester had virtually NO blind spots). I highly recomment this car. Highly.

I've driven this car in the rain, snow and gravel roads and it has not let me down. We have the limited trim with leather seats which are comfortable. We have taken it on several road trips and have no gripes on comfort. Ours came with the six speakers sound system and the sound is great. Another plus is the cargo in the rear and there's lots of it with the seats down. MPG wise our Crosstrek has averaged around 27-28 MPG of mostly mixed driving. The car is very reliable, maintenance wise, costs are low and we have only taken it in for scheduled maintenance. The cons of this car would be the transmission and acceleration. The CVT is loud and noisy. The car feels slow and sounds like it's struggling when accelerating on the on ramp but I realize that this is not a performance car and therefore it does not bother me as much. Another con would have to be the noisy interior. You can hear a lot of road noise in the car. Overall though I love the car. Especially in bad weather, it will never let you down.

While my Legacy handled well in snow storms it had low ground clearance which caused problems. The Limited trim with the navigation and XM radio are definitely worth the extra expense.

My parents had several subarus. They were good cars. This car is garbage and Subaru's customer service was even worse. This is the last subaru our family will ever own. 
Every other vehicle in the category is nicer, faster and all around more capable, but my wife thought it looked cool. Even with the 5 speed manual this car is SLOW. The interior is dated looking and low quality materials. With just over 40k miles, the buttons on the radio are worn, the boot on the e-brake is ripped and more. Despite the ads to the contrary, this vehicle has no off road ability. The all wheel drive system actually works against you most of the time and the traction control has to be turned off or you will be instantly stuck. The worst part of all is that it has been very unreliable. First the battery died, ok, no biggie. Next the horn quit working. Then the passenger seat belt started dinging all the time even with nobody sitting there. Next the AC died. At only 45k miles, the throw out bearing on the clutch froze up and destroyed much of the transmission. This is due to a known issue with the bearing and still Subaru has been unwilling to warranty any of this. This has honestly been the worst car we have ever owned. It will be traded in as soon as the transmission is repaired. Update, transmission repair cost us over $4000.

What a nightmare - I don't care if All other Subaru models are better than this - I will never buy a Subaru again! This model dings and whistles problems whenever it feels like it. If you take it to Subaru service to check the problems out they tell you the car is fine, they are not finding the problems I describe but will charge me for wasting my time. It is a 4 cylinder hybrid that gets gas mileage equivalent to that of a 6 cylinder. The Hybrid system shuts off constantly while driving - alerting me to pull over to a safe place, stop and restart the engine and to check the owners manual. Nothing in the owners manual tells you what the problem is, so after restarting and driving off the warning light will come back on within a few moments of getting back on the road. Everyone that has posted about this same problem can't seem to find a resolution to the problem. The Subaru dealership won't address the issue even though I am supposed to have a warranty.

What is don't like is acceleration from a stop but the engine is not really that big for all wheel drive.  Don't like the seat heaters.   They don't work well, they run off ambient temperature which is annoying.  The seats are not made for bigger butts.  I wish I had a beeper warning with the back up camera.  Other than those things I'm very pleased with the car.  I would definitely buy another one.

I had to buy new tires, I got Coopers. Disappointed that I've lost 4 mpg, but if they last longer than the factory tires I'll be happy. Still very happy with my car after 26 months.

I had never driven in heavy snow before, and I wanted to make sure I would get around ok. I decided on the Crosstrek after reviewing all other AWD vehicles in the same price range. What I liked most about this vehicle was its ground clearance and drivability in the snow. I got around without any issues with the OEM all terrain tires. I'm sure it would have been amazing with a set of good snow tires. Being that this was the sole purpose of purchase I was happy with it. I also enjoyed its relatively roomy interior, and good size trunk space. The seats were comfortable and ultimately once up to speed the drive was fairly smooth and quiet. When summer came around that's when I discovered it wasn't for me. What I absolutely hated about the vehicle was its lack of power and piss poor mpg. This is ultimately why I decided to sell the car. It was very slow and seemed to shift far too late. I consistently got a combined 23mpg with mostly freeway commuting. The cruise control was also poorly controlled in my opinion. I'm used to a smooth consistent acceleration going up hills. This car would just floor it out of no where. The rev limiter would go crazy high, make a bunch of noise, and still the car hardly moved. I also feel like it should have included HID lighting. Overall the Crosstrek is a decent budget AWD multi-terrain vehicle, but needs more power and better lights.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,Mi, 01/07/2016,Not a car for the snow,1,"If you drive in real snow conditions this is not a car you will want. My wife and I have owned 5 Subaru's and this is an absolute disaster. Traffic was stopped on a slight incline on a mountain road as we moved forward the Subaru lost traction and slid all the way across the on coming lane into the snow bank. Tires in excellent condition but this Subaru will not grip the road as my others have. All kinds of other cars and trucks did not have the same problem. Fortunately the oncoming lane was clear as I slid across the road. It took 3 guys pushing to get us out of the snow bank. Car continued to slip and slide when others did not. AWD in this car has design flaw. Do not trust it except on flat roads it is ok.

Bought the car early Dec and driving through a Cold NJ winter! That being said I have not ever been warm enough in this car!! The fan is Loud but there is not a whole heck of a lot of heat coming out especially on the floor!! I hate the Radio, but my iPod music sounds Great! I also think there could be more storage compartments as well as an armrest for the driver.
Finallly, not lovin the black on black on black interior. You see every speck!! The ""ivory"" was not an option - that would have been black in a week."

The dealer then informed me that the 2013 and 2014 Crosstreks have oil consumption issues during the break in period.  When the car had 30k miles, the car would still be down 1 quart or more between changes, so I traded it for a way more reliable Toyota. "

Took the car to the dealer and the car needs an Oil Control Valve. Many cars have this but last at least 75k miles. My ""New"" Crosstrek in the the shop for days and I know this car will give problems in the future. I bought Subaru because of all the reliability hype. As I research the internet more and more, I find that they are not durable, unreliable past 50k miles. Mine broke at 7k miles, thats a smack in the face for Subaru. Don't buy it.  Every make has its problems but you are better off with  Toyota or Honda for reliability.
Do your homework on the internet."

This is time consuming and has to be done BEFORE we move the car, delaying our travel.  We cannot connect the bluetooth when driving, even though the driver is not pushing the buttons.  Subaru Customer Support says that they cannot keep up with all the new cell phones and carriers, and have a list available with the ones that work.  GET MORE HELP THEN!  This is a poor excuse why they cannot get the autoconnect feature to work, but as a consumer it's a good excuse to never buy another Subaru if they cannot keep current with technology.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2014,John John, 12/04/2018,Love of my life,4,"Always ask for carfax. Check the interior and exterior of the car you never know the car you might bought could be a salvage or flood accident. Check for color matching on the car if you spot even a little this could be a bad sign already, moist or unpleasant odor underneath the carpets is sign that a vehicle might be in flood accident. To good to be true price, if you see a price that is very attractive to your eyes be very careful. Example a 2014 BMW 328i with 30k miles for $10k price is so beautiful but what is wrong with this car? You never know until you own this and suddenly it stopped working. Some dealership will not say anything just to sell a vehicle. If they offer you a different one think it first you have to follow your instinct not them. The price they gave might be good but are you sure about that? So be prepare and be smart.

It's not a dragster like my constant headache mustang was, but it's not supposed to be and now that I'm a daddy I'm over my racing days...

I wanted a car that was simple, yet gave me enough convenience. The sound system is good once I figured out how to make adjust the bass/treble/etc. 
It is very roomy and comes with a plastic/rubber back to the seats - once they're folded down you don't have to worry about loading stuff in the back and getting the backs of the seats dirty since its easy to wash off.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,David, 09/26/2015,"Update: review, impressive vehicle for the price",5,"My girlfriend and I were looking to replace her aging Honda Civic four door.  Maintenance costs were getting out of hand.  Over a year, we made a short list of cars and small SUV to consider.  Rather quickly, she was partial to Subaru, but was unsure whether to go with the Forester, Impreza, or Crosstrek.  If you are looking at cargo space with a higher roof line, then yes.. there are other models out there that fit the bill better, and offer more accessories.  However the legendary reliability, safety, and AWD capabilities kept us coming back to Subaru.  We really didn't need massive cargo space, as this was a sometimes commuter car and grocery hauler; and she wanted something more ""car like"" than the CRV, Highlander, or Escape.  Northern Virginia has dense traffic, so the lower profile and suspension offers better handling in my opinion.  The narrow and shorter wheel base gives more assurance when parking in the notoriously small parking spots in this area.  And the looks, in our opinion exceed those of the competition.   

Subaru is not known for their cutting edge technology as it pertains to entertainment, but the 2015 Limited package has everything that is needed, including Bluetooth pairing, Sirius XM, heated seats, climate controls, BACKUP CAMERA, and low tire indicator - which is pretty awesome. The auto headlights and auto dimming rear mirror work well.  We opted not to go with iSight, navigation, or moon roof.  The only option package that came with our car were floormats, rear bumper ledge protection, and a cargo protection mat and cargo cover.

Our XV is a deep, rich red with copious metal flake.  This model came with ivory leather interior, so we opted for a dealer protection package which includes free professional cleaning if anything stains, or tears.  The material seems top notch, the controls are laid out well, and the steering wheel provides a lot of buttons to control the accessories without taking the hands off the wheel.  There appears to be no difficult blind spots, and the view is wide open and easy.

I read the professional review, and I don't find the CVT transmission and engine to be overly noisy as described, but rather normal and non fussy for it's type.  The first few times I drove the Crosstrek, I thought it was a bit under powered when I needed the extra juice to get around slow drivers or to merge.  But, then I discovered the joys of the PADDLE SHIFTERS on the steering wheel, and well... it was a game changer.  This car is very capable if you simply downshift when you need extra power.  Since I drove a standard stick shift for many years, and my Ford Thunderbird has Select-shift, it was very easy for me to understand the mechanics and make the switch when needed.  The backup camera is extremely useful and gives great confidence when backing out of the driveway or a parking spot.  I'm glad all cars will be outfitted with this feature by law in the near future as standard. At 1,500 miles I changed the oil and filter at Jiffy Lube, and learned that it takes synthetic oil, which is more expensive.  I did this to remove the metal shavings that occur during break in, and will help ensure years of service.  My only ding on the car is getting in and out.  I'm not an overweight guy, nor overly tall, but you have to take care to duck when getting into the car so you don't bump your head on the roof-line.  However, it's expected when purchasing a car with low, car like clearance.  We've hauled lots of groceries and home goods with plenty of room.  The ride is not jittery, but smooth.  It's summer/fall, so we have not had the opportunity to drive in the snow, but it handles wet pavement just fine.

The bottom line, you owe it to yourself to test this car.  I got a really good deal, pushing the value of this car well into the best value range.  It keeps getting better as we drive it.
update: 09/28/2016 - We
 still own the Crosstrek, and it does not disappoint.  It's our ""family car"" and grocery hauler.
update:  03/28/2017 - The one thing I always wanted to change about this car was the anemic headlights.  They are very yellow and ""dim"", right out of the box.  I recently replaced the original low beams with Phillips X-Treme Vision halogen lights, after unsuccessfully finding a reliable LED replacement.  It turns out this simple swap out was just the trick for a major upgrade to the light system, providing bright white light, thrown far down the road.  The car still looks showroom new, and we've had no issues with the electronics, engine, transmission, or other mechanics.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Loren, 10/20/2015,Satisfied Customer!!,5,"Obviously this is not the perfect vehicle for everyone, but for what I need it fits the bill well. The main complaint I have heard about this car is that the engine does not have enough power. Of course, it is always nice to have more power, but a bigger engine usually means worse gas mileage and I have not found it to be especially underpowered.... I live in San Francisco and do a lot of driving for work. On the freeway I'm getting up to 40 mpg with the non-hybrid XV.  In mixed city driving I can still average around 34 mpg if I am careful about not having a led foot. 

I did a lot of research before deciding on this vehicle (it's my first subie)..... In my opinion there is no other vehicle in its class that shines in every aspect that the XV does. I wanted a car that I could take on rough roads in the Sierras without having to worry about getting stuck or damage my vehicle. At the same time I drive several hundred miles a week and park on city streets. The XV Crosstrek is short enough that I can fit into tight spots in the City, gets good gas mileage, has a rack for my surfboard, and can go off road with 8.7 inches of ground clearance. 8.7 inches of ground clearance, that is more like a jeep than a crossover SUV. Just to compare: Jeep Cherokee trail rated has 8.7 a Toyota Rav4 has 6.3.

I have put 3000 miles on this car, and I am impressed. Although its not a sports car, it is incredibly fun in certain situations. Its incredibly efficient, and provides enough power for real-world driving situations. Mud, snow, and steep grades...it has performed admirably in every driving situation, so far. Interior quality is on par with any comparably-priced Honda or Toyota. Its certainly not a sports car, and its not a luxury automobile. Its a Subaru! Its practical, reliable, and in some cases, merely ""good enough."" Overall, this seems to be a great car! I love it.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Allen in VA, 09/11/2015,The Most Practical Car In Existance,5,"I purchased my Crosstrek new in February. This was my first new vehicle, and my first Subaru. Mine came with a rear view camera, leather interior, and some other nice features. I was highly impressed from the very beginning, and 7 months and 7k miles later, it looks and feels as good as new. Terry VW/Subaru was amazing to work with and I highly recommend them. Lifetime power train warranty! Anyway...the only complaint I have about the car is that it feels just a tad underpowered. But the CVT certainly helps the feeling. The fuel mileage is impressive in my book. The day after I purchased the car, it snowed about 15"" deep, so I tested it out. I had very much difficulty getting it stuck. I actually had to try. I buried it in snow over the wheel well plastics, but it kept coming, like it was laughing at the snow! My 4x4 pickup was probably embarrassed. The interior is wonderfully comfortable. Within a month of purchase, I had to drive from VA to AL, then to NJ. I wasn't even sore. There's plenty of storage for your average person. I've folded down the rear seats and put small desks and such in with no problem. The Bluetooth and radio quality are much nicer than what I'm used to. This car handles extremely well. Even in snow and ice it refused to stop moving forward. In highway driving, it can feel a bit numb, but in corners where the suspension has some compression, you feel very much in control. Short of a more peppy engine, I don't have one complaint about this car. you cannot go wrong with a Crosstrek!

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,argus4, 01/26/2015,Big (Pleasant) Surprise In A Small Package,5,"I've only had my 2015 Limited since Dec. 31 and 600 miles but to date it appears to be even more of a ""find"" and ""value"" than I hoped. A very practical vehicle with legendary AWD and durability, the Crosstrek also has thoughtful design, comfort and overall appearance. Great handling, relative quiet, impressive and still improving economy (+/- 30 mpg), excellent braking and more-than-adequate power/acceleration for real-world situations are all in this compact package. (Somewhat smaller than a Forester, CRV or the rest of that herd, it's the right size for me.) In short, as of now, I'm surprised, delighted and looking forward to a long ""vehicular friendship""!

UPDATE JANUARY 2017: Now 25 months and 19,500 miles into ownership, I'm still very much delighted with my Crosstrek. Have had no problems with the vehicle, upkeep costs limited to the usual scheduled maintenance and I'm averaging about 28.5 mpg in what I call ""semi-urban"" driving (little stop-and-go and limited highway)!
"
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Charles, 09/18/2015,A lot of versatility in one small package,5,"My VW golf tdi was a fantastic car but it was starting to let me down in the reliability department. For its replacement I needed a car that would meet a lot of requirements: good fuel economy, off road capability, trailer towing capacity, superior safety features, creature comforts (nav, Sirius, Bluetooth, backup camera, heated leather seats, keyless start), room for an 80lbs dog, easy for older folks to get in and out of, and good road holding for driving around in the hills and back roads. The XV crosstrek does all these things and much more, and for a reasonable price. I love the technology packed into this car, the EyeSight technology and related features are wonderful. With the adaptive cruise control the car basically drives itself when on the freeway. This car is built to carry a heavy load, it drives and handles better with many bags of gravel in it than when empty. The hill hold feature is without a doubt the most awesome driveability convenience that I have ever experienced. When on jeep trails and other un-paved roads the handling and ride comfort are truly impressive. I really love this car. Ok here are some things I don't like: the seats are not uncomfortable but having owned several VW golfs, they are no match for the comfort and supportiveness of a VW seat. The controls for the moon roof are the worst I have ever seen, both in function and placement, they are impossible to find while driving without taking your eyes off the road. The heated seat controls are simarly awkward and difficult to operate while driving. The middle rear seat belt retractor mounted in the rear hatch area....why are we still doing this Subaru? It's a joke. Seat integrated middle seat belt retractor like the rest of the civilized world is using please! Finally, at times I have a love hate relationship with the CVT in this car.  Most of the ""shifting"" is great and the car moves quickly and responsively, other times the car seems to bog down when leaving from a stop. For driving in mountain passes I find the paddle shifters are helpful for preventing the CVT from constantly jumping around looking for the right gear ratio. **UPDATE** I tried to love this car and I still believe it's an excellent car, but it wasn't right for me. If I had purchased this car with a manual transmission I very well might still be driving it. This car with the CVT is dangerously unresponsive and underpowered. I mean it's like 'you can't merge safely onto a rural two lane highway without getting hit by a semi truck' slow. It desperately needs about 30 more horsepower, if not 50 more. Also in my area I couldn't throw a brick without hitting another crosstrek the same color as mine, and they are almost never driven by men. Driving this car just didn't feel right and it was bumming me out. So I traded it in on a new VW GTI and actually saved money on my monthly payment and insurance. I still think subarus are great cars and I'm sure I will own one again some day, hopefully a faster one.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,chefh, 04/24/2015,CrossTrek Hybrid,4,"Recently we replaced a Jeep Wrangler due to gas milage for our new Crosstrek. This being our first Subaru we are most happy with everything.  The quality is evident with the interior, ride, power, options, and overall look of the vehicle.  My wife drives this daily across mountains and loves the way it handles.  I'm confident in Subaru's safety record and know the Crosstrek still has the capability for bad weather.  Controls and the instrument panel is easy to use.  View is exceptional too.  You do feel a jolt between the electrical motor and the engagement of the gas engine after setting at a stop, but knowing you're saving fuel makes it worth it in my opionon.  What a fun ride!"
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Paul Spagnolia, 09/02/2015,The best Subaru I've ever owned!,5,"First off know that I traded in an Impreza with bad engine issues that was 2.5 years old and had 61K on it for this.  I'm HYPER critical of Subaru's at this point and they're on their last chance with me with this car.    I got the XV Crosstrek as a better solution to the Impreza.  Higher ground clearance, basically the same body with an extra inch on either side, MUCH better toys inside than my 2013 Impreza.  

Exterior
Lets start with the outside, It's a nice looking car, even nicer looking In my opinion than the Impreza.  It takes that body style and gives it some muscular looks.  That said Subaru did some smart  things.  Things like the Steering Responsive fog lights that are painted the same color as the body.  This is a great feature and looks awesome on this premium style.  I like the wheels and the tires are the standard Subaru equipment Yokohama Geolanders.  They ride incredibly smooth and have a low road resistance which makes for great milage in this style car.  Speaking of mileage, I've had my crosstrek for almost 3 weeks now and it has 2400 miles on it thanks to a vacation trip from MA to Niagara Falls.  That's 800 miles of it right off the bat.  I've had a lot of chance to drive it under normal road driving however understand that I do A LOT of highway miles (henceforth a 2.5 year old impreza with 61K on it).   Believe it or not, I'm averaging 35.4 mpg.  That's on my 30 mile commute to and from work.  The one I chose came equipped with the Eyesight system and a remote start.  Both I absolutely LOVE!!!!   Adaptive cruise control is the way to go, the car maintains a set distance which I can adjust for heavier or no traffic.  There's 3 distances in all and they're speed dependent.  The faster you go, the more distance it'll give.  It performs admirably.  I use it all the time and It is what's mostly responsible for the stellar mileage I'm getting.  Well, that and the fact that it's a brand new car with no wear, perfect alignment, and new tires.

Interior 
The driver and passenger front seats are roomy and more comfortable than my impreza...I dont know why I feel that way as they're the same seats.  I think it might be the better visibility and more peace of mind being a full 4 or 5 inches higher up.  I have the black cloth and in typical subaru fashion, they look nice but look a little flimsy cloth wise.  The interior is that of my Impreza...pretty much the same size and functions the same way.  Telescoping steering wheel... Fold down seats allow for good storage however understand that you wont be hauling 8' 2x4's in this car without having the rear hatch open.  The gagues are pretty straightforward, a tach, speedometer, and a digital speedo and status panel in between them.  The graphics are nice and in color.   The clock and temp are still up on top of the middle of the dash and have been the same for at least 4 or 5 years.  No biggie, they work nicely.   The Starlink 7.0 infotainment system is good.  Sometimes it will get overwhelmed if you have bluetooth attached and are listening to Sirius satellite radio, taking a call, and getting a text at the same time.  It seems (although I don't know this for a fact) that it might have a software reset somewhere within it's code that resets the system eventually.  I would Imagine it might need a software update at some point.   That said, the thing is INCREDIBLE!!!!  It reads texts to me while I'm driving and even gives me the option to do a quick reply like 'I'm driving leave me alone!'  lol....Bluetooth phone call quality is STELLAR compared to the impreza....probably due to a better mic 
or better system in general, All my folks who I talk to while driving appreciate that..again this system has lots of toys,  It'll access pandora, aha, Subaru Starlink, and a host of other apps HOWEVER, it access's them all through your bluetooth connected Wifi device such as your smart
 phone.  You need to have the apps installed on your phone for the starlink system to access them.  Also Starlink is it's own app from subaru.  That has all kinds of feeds in it too.  Speakers are good stock and the system sounds really good.

Update.03/03/2016 - it amazes me at how cool this car is.  Rides smooth and compared to the Impreza quiet.   I've got a few miles on the vehicle now so I'm hearing some road noise out of the tires.   That's my only issue and it's unavoidable.   Tires get noisier as they wear.   I rotate them every oil change.  All in all this car is a great purchase.  Loving the adaptive cruise control .

UPDATE: 03/03/2017 - The XV Crosstrek continues to impress me.  Just took a trip from MA to DC and even with the winter blend of gas, it got a solid 36.5 mpg all the way to and from!  I'm still enjoying this vehicle and it's running great.  I get all my maintenance done at the dealership as they're cheaper for oil changes and rotations that anyone else around (how often do you hear that!) and they give me a 10% discount.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,mikeheel, 06/09/2015,Fun Go-Anywhere SUVish Car,4,"We recently downsized our home and garage. My old 4Runner would not fit in the new garage with my motorcycle, so it was time to look for something smaller. We wanted a reliable vehicle that would also do great in adverse weather (ski & camping trips).  

Another consideration is that our teenage son is almost 6'6"" tall, so he didn't fit well in a lot of mid-sized, much less small, vehicles. But he fits great in the Crosstrek.

Acceleration is better than expected, but I wish Subaru would offer a punchier engine. Ride is excellent. EyeSight with adaptive cruise is very helpful. Car goes anywhere and has fun doing it. Our biggest issue is that everyone wants to drive it, and we only one."
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,James Grobe, 09/06/2015,Definitely Worth the Look!,4,"Traded in a 07 Altima for the Crosstrek and very happy. The car drives well and the mileage is very good for AWD. It is definitely worth having with western NY weather. Seems to be built well and the Subaru's reputation has so improved.  I purchased the premium model but expected a little more from it. There are a few things that could be added or changed to make it an even better deal. For the door ajar light, they use the most basic one where it doesn't tell you which door is actually open - have to do a Chinese fire drill to find out. Having the cloth interior, I was disappointed that it didn't have fabric protection of some sort - picks up dirt really easy. Storage space is rather limited-had much more in my Altima. Because this car is overall a great car, I would make an recommendation for an extra trim selection - the homeowner's trim package. The length of the car is set to carry 10' boards which is great. If there was a way to fold down the front seat it would be fantastic. The package could also include the crossbars for the roof rack. Finally, put a hook on the hatch someplace so you can use tie-downs when needed to hold it shut.

In my humble opinion, they are absolutly wrong.  I just purchased a 2015 Crosstrek premium.  I live in Northern ND and wanted a fun to drive AWD vehicle that gets decent MPG.  My new Subie is exactly that.  My prior vechicle was a 05 Nissan Maxima, this car hauled some serious butt. The crosstrek is of course slower but I was pleased at how fast the little car actully is.

I have gotten up to 40MPG on long road trips and I average about 27-30 in and around town. Some of the ""professional"" reviewers fault the car because they think the sound system is below par. Well granted, it's not a 1000 watt  20 speaker Bose system but it works good and the sound seems more than adequate. The navigation  system is the best that I have ever used. I am comparing it to all the Tom Toms I've used and the system in the Chev Traverse I traded in plus all the ""apps"" for the phones. There is not much cargo space because it is a hybrid and what would be cargo space is taken up by the batteries. The only fault I can see so far is the fact that the doors will not lock when you shift into gear or get up to a set speed. I find this quite a bother. I am used to the door locks being automatic and have driven many miles before I remembered to lock the doors. This is a safety feature that I think they need to correct.

Eyesight cruise control is wonderful, especially when in heavy traffic.  Visibility all around is excellent with narrow front window pillars and no rear blind spot.  Automatic climate control works great and I don't have to fiddle with the controls to be comfortable (which I cannot say for two other cars I have had with automatic climate control)."

It's no fire breathing V8 but it's powerful enough. Cabin is very spacious, seats are wonderful, the ride to me is quiet and pleasant. As soon as I bought the car, it started snowing.

I had a 2000 vw Jetta and it never shook that much. I live in southern Ca. , so I know it's not the cold weather...took it to the Subaru repair shop and they said it's typical with box engines....still I'm doubtful bc the car had 70 miles when it was sold to me as ""new.""

-Easy to see everything around you and the backup camera is very nice.
-Drives like a nimble and agile car with the height of an SUV. The turning radius is impressive.
-Wife loves the easy to load kids and grocery heigh of the vehicle.
-Plenty of cargo room and you can fold the seats flat for a lot lot more.
-Vehicle does not have good 40-70 acceleration but that is to be expected with a CVT only being supplied with 148 horses. That being said the acceleration from a dead stop is impressive.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,James, 09/02/2015,Great Car,5,"I've always liked the design of this car.  It gets great gas mileage and I can still use it on my mountain bike, ski and camping trips.  But when I went to buy, I read how slow this car is from the majority of reviewers.  I tend to disagree with those people.  I live in Colorado and am in the mountains every weekend.  With the CVT (which some have called worthless) paddle shifters, this car has no issues climbing, passing, and slowing you down on hill descents.  It hugs the road, and is great in the snow.  It's obviously not a sports car, but for what it is made for, it excels.  What other car gives you 34 miles per gallon, has standard awd, and still has good off road capability?  I'd highly recommend this car if it's something you're thinking about.
"
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Carolyn, 05/23/2016,Disapointing experience,3,"This was my first new car purchanse in 12 years. I buy quality and drive it forever. I drove my Honda CRV for 11 years, until she got totalled by hail. I wanted a make that would hold it's value as well as the CRV did. Subaru seemed like a good choice. I also got a smokin deal, which is a good thing, since I'm selling it after only 18 months. This vehicle does a few things well. It's awesome in the snow. I've passed big trucks stuck in the drifts to get where I was going using a slow and steady approach. Which is odd, since the vehicle has no guts. It has poor acceleration and drags going up a hill. Passing is a white knuckle thing. I didn't think I would mind the reduction in power because of the fuel efficiency. It is very efficient. In fact, I ran out of gas a couple times because it would go so far on a single tank, I'd forget to get gas. But after only 18 months, I'm shopping for something else. I don't understand why Subaru would make such a sporty car, and have no upgrades to give it more pep. The vehicle is not comfortable. I didn't realize this just zipping to work and around town, but a trip into the mountains and I was shifting this way and that, could not get comfortable for a long hall. It's really loud when it shifting up, and this takes a ridiculously long time. The blue tooth is aweful, people always ask me to pick up my phone cause they can't hear me. What's the point in that? I've had a lot of weird electronic stuff too. Like..I get in the car and it tells me the phone is not connected. I have to turn the engine off to ""reboot"" and then it works fine. I've had various ""check engine"" lights come on, and then stay off the next time I start the car. I did take it in, and the service from the dealer has been excellent. But it's too intermitent for them to diagnose.This is the prettiest crossover out there, which is what got me in trouble. Don't be fooled though, you cant see the ouside when your driving!
"
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,burningred, 04/30/2015,Great deal!,4,"As another reviewer mentioned, everyone says this car has slow acceleration. I too disagree. This is a fun little car to drive, and with all-wheel drive and 9 inches of clearance, it'll do great when I take it up to the mountains. The hatchback trunk is practical; I'm glad they're coming back in style. The Venetian Red color is beautiful, and the Limited's leather seats and keyless entry don't hurt either. Nice interior, comfortable seats for long drives. Equipped with EyeSight, this would be a great car for a beginning driver. Its safety braking and automatic deceleration would have prevented my first accident, a rear-end fender bender. "
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Aurick S., 09/10/2015,Wonderful Little Car!,5,"Test driving the different Crosstrek's (among other Subaru cars) I have found that the hybrid touring version was a lot more enjoyable to drive than the base model to limited Crosstrek. I found it a lot quieter and overall a great experience that I ended up purchasing the 2015 Crosstrek Hybrid Touring. It's not a speedster but that doesn't bother me ( I have a motorcycle for that ), and it does lack in the cargo department ( Hybrid battery takes away from some of the cargo room ), but besides those small con's I'm really glad I made the purchase. The bluetooth was easy to set up ( you're able to set 5 devices ), the speakers are not going to blow you away, but they more then suffice for me, push button start is a nice touch, and the navigation works great! I average close to 33 mpg, which to me is amazing since my previous car was around 13 mpg (92 Nissan pathfinder). Could not be happier with this car!

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Sura Spiegel, 12/07/2015,Good not comfortable,3,"Today test drove the Crosstrek Limited urged by the reviews we read. I was sure this would be our new car today, but during the test drive found the cabin noise, road noise and engine noise to be tiresome. The seats are not comfortable both the driver and the passenger. We sat in the Limited Outback and the diffetence felt like two completely different manufactures. The inside cabin felt cheap (this was the Limited version) too much thin plastic and smelled like cheap plastic ( not the ""new car"" smell. We were disappointed - for $29,000 we were expecting more car. I'm sure the AWD is great from. Subaru, but the car simply felt flimsy and noisy
"
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Mary, 07/29/2016,Love it EXCEPT the windshield,4,"I bought my Crosstrek less than a year ago.  At first it was very sluggish when accelerating from a complete stop (did fine if already in motion).  This improved after I drove it hard for a few months.  Gas mileage is fabulous at 30-31 mpg on my daily commute.  I don't like the cruise control system as it breaks hard going downhill to keep exactly at the set mph (I have alot of hills on my drive).  I noticed also that the cruise system depletes my mpg as well, due to the frequent braking/accelerating.  I have not had any issues with acceleration/passing in the mountains of CO like some other reviewers.  Handling and stability are awesome, especially in snow and mud (even better than my Dodge Ram 1500).  Being short I am very comfortable in any of the seats and with entry/exit.  However, my 6ft 2in husband hates getting in and out of it, but he is comfortable once in the vehicle.  Bluetooth is pointless as no one can hear/understand me while the car is in motion.  I have not had a single mechanical issue.  However, I would advise that if you live in an area with gravel roads, gravel is used on roads for winter traction, or go to the mountains frequently not to get the EyeSight.  It requires a ""dealership only"" glass to replace the windshield so that the EyeSight will calibrate right.  Windshield repair places in my area say they have a contractual obligations with Subaru to use the ""dealer only"" glass. I am on my THIRD windshield in less than a year!  And one of the windshields, I drove cracked in three different areas through the winter. I knew if was replaced it would be chipped and cracked within days.  One month is the longest I have gone without a cracked windshield.   Once chipped, each time the windshield has cracked within minutes, making it impossible for me to get it in for chip repair vs full windshield repair.  I was three car lengths behind the other vehicles when the chips happened, and one chip was from a rock thrown by a truck going the opposite direction on a two lane road.  So not a matter of driving habits, just thin crappy glass.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Robert, 05/06/2016,"Crosstrek ""Hybrid"" mediocre fuel economy",2,"Update. Subaru and others must have agreed with my review, as the hybrid was laid to rest. If you are considering a used one, turn and run, youve been warned. Plain and simple..we bought a fake hybrid Crosstrek, at a 3000 + dollar discount. Thank goodness because we got out of it in a year. Car got barely 25 mpg overall. Hybrid system used only electric power for seconds at a time. Car shuts off which is supposed to help mileage. What a joke, car would start and stop several times at a red light and if you need to crawl forward a few feet would kick back on with a startling jolt.  Instrumentation is crude at best. Very difficult to navigate the info screen, not intuitive at all. Road noise is completely unacceptable. Plain loud. Back seats cramped for a vehicle this size and the trunk is miniscule due to battery placement. Factory stereo is a joke. Horrible experince in a new car. Had a previous older model Forester that was a better car than this. Only saving grace was the huge discount, enabling us to trade into something else. We leased a Cadillac SRX AWD at a great deal, paying about 75 dollars a month more for a much, much better car. The huge Caddy with its big engine and hefty weight manages 18 mpg overall. If you need something AWD and affordable look elsewhere.

Can beat the great price and hugs the road and great in bad weather.  Its not super luxorious by any means but still has all the stuff I need.  Fits me great, being 6'3' and 250+  which is nice.  With the bluetooth and everything it works well.  

Only thing I wish is to be more room in the trunk area to put random stuff.  But I will figure out a system.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Nowhereman, 05/31/2017,80k miles in and....,1,"My crosstrek's CVT transmission went out on me at just under 80k miles, or better yet, just past the warranty. I never did hard driving with it; only highway miles too and from work. The price to have it fixed? 8000 dollars! And it was a little past the power train warranty too. It's a good car, but I have never heard of a transmission going out that quick before. Just beware.
UPDATE: The CVT was replaced and the bill was paid by Subaru, (Yay!) but I still have a oil consumption issue that despite Subaru saying it’s normal, I still put in nearly a quart between changes. Nothing like carrying a quart around with you where ever you go for those special moments...
UPDATE 2: now at 102k miles I’m up to almost two quarts of oil between changes and this is after running the oil consumption 
test two more times, it’s still comes back as ‘acceptable oil consumption’. I’m keeping Valvoline in business...
FINAL UPDATE: Traded in the Crosstrek with 133k miles on it. It continued to have very bad excessive oil consumption even after Subaru said it’s in acceptable levels. I was putting in a quart every 600 miles. New piston rings were needed. The transmission started to act funny; occasionally missing first gear. Despite a complete transmission fluid change of 12 quarts, the Subaru mechanic told me the transmission is starting to fail. My second transmission by the way. And finally my check engine light made itself knows frequently by letting me know my catytaltic converter is failing. Most likely do to my Subaru approved ‘acceptable’ oil consumption. The total of all the repairs to get this corrected would set me back almost 10 thousand dollars. Nope, not doing that. Ironically though, my head gaskets never started to leak. Conclusion: Subaru is garbage, traded for a Toyota instead and now I have a habit of checking my oil every weekend...

Yes, its bit noisy but not enough to write home about. Throughout the cold Northeast winter; I have been averaging 28 mpg and hoping for a bit more when winter blend gas ends. Comfortable ride and the ability to see everything is a great safety feature. Love the backup Camera feature particularly with parallel parking in the city and avoiding snow banks. Here is to another 200,000 plus miles and 10 years!"
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Ronald, 11/02/2015,Should have test drove it with passenger,2,"I see why the dealership push the CVT I should have not picked a 5 speed. I commute about 60 miles one way. This is not a commuter car do yourself a favor pick the 6 speed if you want a manual shift. The gears are so near each other it is more like a 3 speed not a 5. I shift 1 3 5 90% of the time. If they would change 5 gear or make it a 6 speed you can pick up more MPG. 5 gear 3000 RPM is ~ 65. In my 11 year old Subaru it would be almost 75. Who decided to put the emergency brake lever on the driver side? This causes 2 issues one it moves 1st gear over more to the passenger side it is not far drivers side natural position so when you shift to 5 gear you are in the passengers leg with the shifter.  Next when you need it you can find the lever for the brake it is under you right leg. UPDATE  Due to the oil burn issue and I was told if I purchased another one that it would not guarantee that I would not see the same issue again. Subaru bought the car back. I went with a Honda CRV

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Paul, 08/22/2015,Best Car I Shall Ever Own,5,"Maybe it was love at first sight, or maybe it was because I had been suffering in a dying 15+ year old sedan, but I love driving my 2015 CrossTrek. I have a terrible commute, can be 2 hours one way, and so I spend a lot of time in my car. This car handles like a smaller vehicle, gets the highway gas mileage despite my sitting in gridlock for most of my trip, and is just a fun car to drive. The AWD is amazing, take this car off-road and it really shines, I have jumped a few medians and curbs because of hazards and aside from a little bump, we are on our way again no problem. This is not a luxury vehicle, but it still gets people's attention (it's bright orange.) The StarLink set-up needs a little work as it is a super glitchy, but it isn't an issue for since I plug in my iPod into the USB and let the Bluetooth connect my phone. Subaru has a rep for quality and rugged performance so I expect the car to age well. You aren't going to find a safer, better car with the same features for the money.<br><br>

Update: Still agree with everything I said. Just crossed 13,000 miles and nary a glitch or an issue with it. Gas mileage dropped a tad during frigid weather, but thanks to the AWD I was able to tear through a record single day snowfall without no difficulty. It was amazing driving on a road I would have not even attempted for days with my previous cars.

Update#2: Still agree with above. Pushed the MPG to 34.5 at approx 24,000 miles. Can't say enough good about this car.

Update #3: All of the above remains true. At 36,000 miles and counting. Great car.

Update #4: Still true. Approaching 50K miles and rides like it just came off the showroom lot.

Update #5: Still true. Approaching 65K miles. Still a great car.

Update #6: Car saved me and my daughter any injury in a serious accident. The RAV4 that hit us literally fell apart. Unbelievably drove this car 550 miles home after the accident, on one tank of gas (this is a true story!)

The car does not get anywhere near the advertised mpg...
The automatic transmission is horrible
Road noise is rediculous 
Bluetooth is non useable will driving
Our engine developed a head gasket leak and the dealer told me that I was going to believe what I wanted to believe. I have been an engine builder for more than 20 years so I am not a blind eyed customer. The all wheel drive system on this car is superior to all others period. We wanted to keep this car forever and let our 7 yr old drive it when he turned 16. But I have serious doubts that Subaru has fixed the head gasket issues that plaque the boxer engine. We sold this car 12 months and 26k miles after we bought it. I felt comfortable taking a $5,000 loss because I have no faith that subaru would take care of us. I am not mad, and I am not trying to bad mouth subaru. I am only here writing my first review EVER on ANYTHING because I think people really need to think long and hard before buying this car.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Dee, 11/04/2015,Honest Assessment,4,"I previously owned a Pontiac Vibe and what I have discovered with both vehicles, vibe/crosstrek, is that there is a sweet spot in the small engine vehicles that will get you the highest mileage.  ~36 to 40 going 50 - 55 miles per hour.  The higher the miles per hour the lower the gas mileage.  The Crosstrek has given me 32 hwy mpg going 70 mph on the interstate and about 22 mpg around town.  The Crosstrek is noisy, the windshield is huge and angled wrong causing constant reflection of the dash only disappearing with polarized sunglasses and the sun is on most of your body making it hot.  I can't see the lights at the intersection with the visors down and have to scrunch down to see or make sure there is a side signal.  The back seats are comfortable for passengers.  The driver seat cuts off the circulation of the back of my legs, even with the up and down adjustment.  I just can't seem to get a position that is not painful for my gas pedal foot.  I use cruise control as much as possible.  I am a 60 year old 5'8"" woman.  The clearance was great for getting down about  graveled driveway with about 8 inches of snow.  It has not burned oil, we babied it the first 1000 miles (not going above 4 on the rpm) and is an automatic transmission.  The oil burning seemed to be the manual transmissions.  I do wish there was a bit more cargo.  The vibe front passenger flipped flat and extended the cargo area but the crosstrek models don't do that.  The usb ports are in the middle front compartment that holds stuff/cds etc.  In the model I have there are no on dash ports with the stereo/radio. Plan to retire to snow country, thus the purchase with the clearance.  We own a Honda Element that is our bigger all around hiking/skiing vehicle.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Mike, 01/25/2016,Think again if u want something with power,3,"I still ponder why Subaru would put such a low HP engine in this vehicle?

Anyway...I love the look and size of this vehicle. At first I thought this was going to be the ideal car for me, as an owner of 3 previous Subaru Outbacks, this fit the perfect size for me. I tended to ignore the complaints of the underpowered motor as numerous said you simply use the upper end of your rpm's vs lower end in more powered vehicles. 

I will say this, I am more of an aggressive driver so hence my big complaint about the power. The crosstrek feels like it ""dies"" in corners. I feel like I have to floor the gas pedal to get it to kick it out of this ""dead zone"" the motor goes into when coming out of a corner. I also on numerous times have not attempted to power into a gap when merging from an onramp because I know the Crosstrek simply cant handle powered acceleration well. Ive never had this in any of the other vehicles Ive owned. When I now drive other peoples cars and they complain about the power, I laugh and tell them they have no idea and should climb in the Crosstrek to appreciate the power they DO have. Funny thing is when I went to get an appraisal on my old car before leasing the crosstrek, a guy was in there selling his Crosstrek and I asked him why and his answer was EXACTLY the reason Im complaining about. Otherwise he too loved the vehicle. Comon Subaru!

Interior controls are also very poor. Sound system is very weak as well as heat and AC motors. In a decent car where 3-4 bars are normally enough to get sufficient air, you have to crank the blower up to almost full blast to get anything decent. 

And, Im now done with Subaru and their ""we are going to try and irritate you as much as possible"" and their audible seat belt alarms!!! No other car dings you as constant and as loud as this manufacturer..its relentless with the audible alarm. And Ive spoken with others who own Subarus and they say the same thing. 

And yes on MPG's.....trust me, if you are like me that wants power, theirs no way you are going to get their advertised MPG's in the city, you will be closer to any other SUV out there, as you are flooring the accelerator to suck every bit of power out this engine and their goes your gas mileage!

So far, I have been extremely satisfied with this vehicle (4000 miles). In most ways, it compares to my 2014 Civic, About the same noise level, similar acceleration, similar comfort, etc. The fuel efficiency is quite good if you believe the fuel mileage computer. Do not believe it. At least in my car the indicated mileage is at least 6-8% higher than the calculated fuel efficiency. Subaru, you can do better than that. At least Honda has this ability (never more than 1/2 mpg off vs the constant 2+ mpg error in the Crosstrek. I am only getting 30-31 mpg right now but hope this improves with the warmer weather."

But the cross trek is more fun to drive, Took it to Cimarron New Mexico this summer. Fun to drive in the mountains was averaging 33mpg. So it does better in high elevations.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Bryan, 01/29/2017,Mechanically sound but technologically deficient,4,"Vehicle has been very reliable and dependable. Good performance in the snow. Decent MPG. Easy to change oil. 

Technology is very poor though. Text message and e-mail display fails to work most of the time.  ""EyeSight"" active safety system has far too many false alarms and is more of an annoyance than useful. ""EyeSight"" frequently turns off due to inclement weather, leaving two very bright indicators on the dash. System takes a long time to scan for music on USB devices, and has to do it on every start up, even if the USB device was left plugged in. Steering wheel has four audio buttons on the same rocker switch, leading to pressing wrong controls unintentionally. 

Remote start system is an awful design. Remote start, as added to keyless entry system, does not reach more than 40 feet. And after remote starting, the vehicle turns off when the door is opened. Who thought that was a good idea? Also honks main horn when remote starting, real great for the neighbors. Rear defrost does not turn on with remote start, which is silly because that is mainly used during winter. 

Vehicle could also use a more powerful engine option and a better sound system option. Small annoying delay when shifting from reverse to drive. Gas latch is in a terrible location on the floor of the driver side. Prone to collecting dirt and debris, unless you have a floor mat that covers it.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,TJ, 10/14/2018,Trading it In,2,"I have only ever heard great things about Subarus. This was my first. I am trading it in with about 89K miles after 3 years due to frequency of repairs and lack of reliability. PROS: My crosstrek is comfortable, quite, great power, handles AMAZINGLY well in the snow (I’m a nurse and commute 100miles/day no matter the weather). It’s fun to drive, great on even class 4 roads. Spacious: I have gotten 2 kayaks in the back with the 2nd row put down and the trunk closed >75%.  CONS: Problems I have had thus far include: radio repair (CD player randomly stopped working, Bluetooth always intermittent), replacing 3 brake calipers that seized up at different times in the last 9K miles (once having to tow it home over 50miles), having an intermittent unfixable problem that the dealership “could not replicate” where the key gets stuck in the ignition and you have to jam the shifter out of park, back into drive and then back into park and sometimes restart it once or twice to get the key out. I also had my break light switch go (covered under warenty at the time) but had to have the car towed back to the dealership on my way home from having it fixed when the new break light switch was not installed properly. That resulted in the breaks consistently being engaged and not being able to get the car out of 2nd gear on the highway (scary!). The dealership then tried to blame me with a weak excuse like that I “must park it where mice could get in it.” I had to remind them it got to the dealership just fine under its own power that time.... Overall, I was very disappointed with my local Subaru dealership’s service. And not just one dealership but two (I started getting some Subaru-specific repairs done at the second after a negative experience with the first). Oh, and other con: Subaru locks most things that require maintenance under the hood so your non-Subaru dealership mechanic cannot check things for you! Transmission fluid for example. For the record, my father also drives a Crosstrek after a good first year with mine. Of course, Subaru’s limited warenty ended before most problems started. My dad has loved his 2016 so far but the key is starting to do the same thing... I loved my 2015 but no longer have the time or money to keep up with the repairs while still making payments on it too. I need something more reliable for my commute that should handle highway driving better.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,w r, 07/05/2017,Symmetrical Ultimate Vehical for any season,5,"The main reason I have chosen this car was the versatility of usages in any season, winter, snow, sand, mountain, city driving everything is covered. You do not need snow chain, you do not need special tires. Just use all season Michelin tires and you will be more than happy. It is extremely reliable. It has the highest resale value and very good fuel economy(29+ MPG). It is not too big and not too compact. It is not too expensive either. Most of the car loose value significantly(40%+) in first 5 years, however, this car lost only 5%-10%, because it has a very high demand and that demand drives the less depreciation.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Cody Yeager, 06/05/2018,Surefooted Subaru,5,"Most Subaru buyers are college educated women and that describes me.  This is my fifth Subaru, so I know of which I speak.  I have driven Foresters, Outbacks, and even the old Loyale.  The Crosstrek is far and away the most surefooted vehicle I have ever driven.  I don't use chains or studs;  I don't need to.  It is not unusual for me to ford streams or climb the roads around Oregon's highest peak, Mt. Hood, in winter.  Never have I felt the Crosstrek slide at all. I call my car ""Orange Crush,"" because it is the beautiful tangerine color.  Paint is in excellent condition after 3 years, as is the leather interior.  Even my two dogs who are always co-piloting haven't managed to scratch or tear it.  WIth my kayak on the roof, my two dogs inside, along with all our gear, there is still plenty of room.  Best car ever.  30,000 miles on the odometer and not one issue, except having to replace the battery a few months ago. On the freeway, it is not unusual to reach 40-42 MPG.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Josh Jones, 01/20/2016,"Dont buy the ""everything is great""",3,"Brand new car, rolls back on hills,  radar turns itself off, eyesight works sure,,, but check out all the road conditions when it doesnt- typically the time when you need it,, so is it of use?  Not racers here as dog owners but mpg is lower than stated. Not impressed really. ** UPDATE,,, SOLD THE CAR**

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Aubi, 07/23/2015,Could be just my one car,3,"Check out the welds, I think a poor job was done on many locations, the weld cleaning was not good or identical. 

The interior door panels felt cheap, they were flimsy and always afraid it would brake. The wires to the rear view mirror on the windshield for power were not even concealed with a piece of plastic. The mirror vibrates badly even if you listen to NPR. 

The Seats rattled a lot, though you hit a small bumpy road things start to rattle on the rear seat. It is one where no one has sat on it yet except my wife on the day we took it while the guy was explaining controls with me in the front and only with 1000 miles on it.

The engine and transmission (I am sure just mine) when I shift it makes lot of noise, the car shakes a bit violently to crank up.

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Rich Troyer, 04/30/2015,its a great vehicle,4,My 2007 Forester got totalled by someone who was playing on his phone so I opted to downsize because I have to do alot of city driving for my job.  I got a Blue with Bone interior.  The car looks great when it gets muddy as well as when its sparkling clean.  I was nervous about the very light interior but I like it.  I am not someone who gives many 5s when I rate something because nothing is perfect.  A 3 means its just fine to me.  I gave it a 3 for value because I think the Forester is a better value but the new onse made me feel like I was a soccer mom. 
subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Maureen Saunders, 11/13/2015,It's an imprezza with lifts!,5,"Great car!  Compact but so roomy.  Can get into almost any parking spot.  Should have lighted vanity mirrors like the Outback, but doesn't!

subaru,xv-crosstrek,2015,Greenlady, 03/16/2020,Phillppe!!! My lime green hybrid baby is the best!,5,"My 2015 hybrid crosstrek is a subie at heart. It is the first gen of hybrids for subaru, so its performance as a ""hybrid"" is dabbly at best. It is nice in the city b/c emissions are drastically reduced,  but this baby was built as a subie first and a hybrid second. The hybrid has a bit more horsepower that compensates for the crostrek's heavier frame so, unlike basic treks, the hybrid has a bit of ""get up and go."" If you are a fan of 90's  or particularly 2002 imprezas then you know that a good suburu should be peppy, fun to drive, and reliable. The 2015 hybrid checks all those boxes. The only quirk, no spare wheel (thats where the hybrid battery goes). So get a spare and keep it in the back for road trips, just in case. Or get a cool roof rack and put the spare on top for travel. Btw, thpey engineered this baby so that the oild practically changes itself! Don't overpay to have some one else do it, watch a few youtube vids and you will be blown away by how wonderfully they designed routine maintence. LOVE this car it is a mega deal and awesome investment for any smart buyer.

Its the middle of the summer and the car ac doesn't work all the time. I read the owners manual and found this as a feature to the car.. do not like

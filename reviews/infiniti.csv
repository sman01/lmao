infiniti,q50,2014,Ashley, 03/25/2016,Don't let the reviews scare you!,5,"I was in the market to purchase a Q50, the reviews were scary. Look, the infotainment center is a computer! Just like any desktop computer, it is going to take a minute to boot up & become responsive. So if you are expecting super fast touch screens, do not look at this car. For me, It is quick enough, I never complain about it because I look at it as a computer and interact with it as such! I Love the car and all the features is offers! The ride is smooth, the car is quick & coming from a Hyundai Sonata the difference in quality all around is massive! I bought this car for a long term daily drive & am a happy camper!

infiniti,q50,2014,jpat0973, 03/01/2015,Ordinary driver's review after 2 months,4,"I'my not a professionally trained driver looking to evaluate this car on how many Gs it pulls.  I'm an ordinary guy who commutes 100 miles per day and bought this car to drive it like most people will - on traffic filled highways and streets with stop lights, not hairpin turns.  It is whisper quiet on the highway, faster than anything else you'll see on the road, and sips fuel.  Technology is beyond what I need, but has nice features.  I didn't get the deluxe technology package because I am more than capable of staying in my lane and hitting the brakes.  Bottom line, this is a really nice sedan (it's not a sports car). Extra note, it's great in the snow."
infiniti,q50,2014,uttim75, 12/21/2013,Almost perfect,4,"This car is nearly perfect.
It has a combination of looks, power, and technology that's unbeatable in its class, except for one thing: it bundles features that should be standard into expensive packages.


I was ready to purchase the Q50 AWD Premium with navigation and leather.
But in order to get memory seats and a reverse tilt down mirror, you have to move up to the Deluxe Package (another $3,100).

This is unacceptable.
I do NOT want the Direct Adaptive Steering that's part of this package.
Really disappointed Infiniti would force its customers to buy this new technology that many do not want. "
infiniti,q50,2014,imrgaff, 03/21/2014,Three years and still an Awesome vehicle,5,"After three years this is still the best car I have ever owned.  I have not had one problem with it and it has just been a joy to drive.  I almost dread turning it in for a new lease.  

This is my third Infiniti - G35, G37S and now the Q50.
I have loved all of them but this is by far the best of the bunch. Everything about this car is great including the technology, which is amazing.
The handling and the ride are better than both of the previous cars.
"
infiniti,q50,2014,banman10, 07/24/2014,Excellent New Model,5,"This is my second Infiniti. I Previously owned the initial model year 2003 Infiniti G35. 12 years old, 225,000+ miles and ran like new. 
The new Q50 is a spectacular car. The fit and finish of the vehicle is on par with a BMW, Lexus, etc. The attention to detail is evident throughout. The navigation system and iPad like internal systems (music, navigation, concierge, etc.) touchscreen adds significantly to the driver experience. Alternative driving modes including Sport mode afford the driver incredible engine and drivetrain responsiveness. When combined with the drive by wire handling, which has to be experienced to be appreciated, it provides a great overall driver experience.

Well it's been over 2 years driving this car. The car is a pleasure. Fun to drive, excellent handling (best of any car I have owned), tremendous acceleration, comfortable on long drives, quiet and great sound system. Leased the car now I will buy it.
"
infiniti,q50,2014,mtlinfin, 08/03/2014,Not Bad,4,"I had a 2012 G37S, so this is a direct comparison.
The Q50 isn't bad but it's a more refined and watered down G.
The build is more solid with tighter fitting exterior joints and more solid interior.
My G would creak and pop over any imperfection, this is much more solid of a car with a stiffer structure.
The steering is not like the G AT ALL!
New steer by wire is HORRIBLE!
I have the elect assist and it has more feel but on center isn't great and too light.
The car is quieter, but could be better.
The run flat tires are prob the culprit.
The gas mileage is pretty good, avg 30.9 on 600 mile trip at 65-75 mph.
The infotainment system is half baked and needs major work."
infiniti,q50,2014,Mohamed Samman, 03/15/2015,Q50 experience-15 months later,4,I leased a Q50S AWD Hybrid in Nov 2013. The first couple of months I had problems with the Infiniti Connection technology that even the dealership couldn't figure out how to fix. Since then it has been a very pleasant experience. The recent addition of the inTouch apps is nice. The handling and cornering is the same if not better than BMW 335. In Sport mode the acceleration is awesome and the paddle shifters are very responsive. When accelerating from low speed in standard or eco mode the transmission appears confused which gear to shift to first and sometimes fails to respond properly to the driver's foot on the gas pedal.
infiniti,q50,2014,johnnywild74, 03/16/2014,best car i ever owned,5,best car i ever owned very powerful great looks tech is awesome in the car
infiniti,q50,2014,grutkay, 04/26/2014,Initial reviewer has a case of sour grapes,5,"I purchased my Q50 just recently, I got the total safety package including drive by wire, the radar activated brakes, the camera that views the road, etc...

It's the best car I've ever had in my life! Comfort is superb for long trips, fuel economy is only 1L/100km more than my old Chevy Cobalt. The engine has a frightening amount of power to it, this car accelerates on 0.2 seconds longer from 0-100km/h than a Bentley Continental GT! It's a real powerhouse!

I love the safety packages, I picked this car so my wife would have good comfort and safety and she loves the seats, the built-in heat and all around smooth ride.

infiniti,q50,2014,Pierre, 02/29/2016,Love my Q50 but... What were they thinking???,5,"Inside this sleek, elegant body lies a powerful, well-balanced drivetrain.  So what's wrong with it?  The electronics, that's what (and the disappointing mpg figures).  The Intel-powered navigation and touch screen controls take almost two minutes to boot up.  The array and alternate modes of controlling are befuddling.  It all detracts from an otherwise very attractive chariot.  Shame on Infiniti for launching a product with instruments/interfaces that were obviously either untested or works still in progress.
"
infiniti,q50,2014,David, 07/24/2015,My last Infiniti,2,"Good looking car, strong engine for the most part, comfortable interior on road trips, but overall a disappointment.  Definitely buyer's remorse.  The inTouch electronics are buggy, slow, or just plain don't work.  Dealer has been really nice, but they can't change the poor quality and design of the manufacturer's electronics.  I have a complaint logged with Infiniti Consumer Affairs, and they were also really nice, but unwilling to do anything about the problems I've had.  I've had the car about a year and a half, and its been in the shop cumulatively for almost a month.  And after today, when several functions of the car electronics disappeared, I now have to schedule it into the shop again.  I have never had problems like this with any car I've ever owned.  My second Infiniti, but it will be my last.

infiniti,q50,2014,w2w2p, 11/11/2013,Luxury sport sedan for family,5,"I purchased my brand new Infiniti Q50 a few weeks ago. Everything about this car is great. Superb performance and quality. I was looking for a luxury sports sedan that can easily fit a child seat + 2 adults (occasionally) in a backseat and has reasonable trunk space. Also looked at C class and BMW 3 series, but they felt too small in that aspect. The main advantage of Infiniti Q50 in this segment is that 37k base car gets you 5.2 sec 0-60 performance. ~330 horses with no turbos, sounds awesome!"
infiniti,q50,2014,Ken Cribbs, 07/24/2016,You must drive this car to appreciate its wonders!,4,"It takes some time to appreciate the advanced technology the 2014 Q50S Hybrid brings to the table.  Once you ""get it,"" you won't want to go back to conventional drive trains or steering/suspensions. Now three-plus years into ownership of my Q50s Hybrid with all available options (except for AWD, which isn't needed in my urban tropical climate), I enjoy driving this vehicle more than ever. 

Ignore the naysayers! The hybrid Q50s with the 3.5L gas engine apparently has been discontinued in current model years, so this gem is now quite scarce on the market. If you find one in good shape with reasonable mileage, by all means, buy it!
"
infiniti,q50,2014,Kevin, 08/26/2016,Good car - Researched a ton before buying!,4,"I read the reviews on here and was nervous about buying the car. My wife and I wanted a 4 door sedan because we already had the Explorer Sport (large SUV). I bought the 2014 and wanted the '15 because of the so so rating s on the '14 Q50... but this car was too good of a deal to pass up because it only had 6K miles on it (Bought Used -  prior owner only leased). I have not had any issues with the car since I have owned it ( 1+ Year.)    The biggest complaint about this car on these reviews has been the electronics...GOOD NEWS! there is a software update for the electronics.. however it still has some really minor bugs.  Example: When you start up the car its takes my car approximately 43-46 seconds for the apps to load. With this includes the rear camera ""drive aid"" lines. So if you hop in your car you can still use the reverse camera but the ""drive aid"" lines wont show up until your car software has loaded which again takes almost 1 minute. So this is occasionally annoying but not enough for me to hate the car. Other than that, the layout of the electronic is really nice. I am a simple guy who wanted a sharp looking car that had some kick to it ( this car definitely has some speed to it). I also wanted a car that when you sit in it, you are impressed by the look of the dash and the display which the double screens is really sharp. The one real knock I would have on the car is the lack of storage. Also, if you are over 6 foot - this car may be too tight for you but still check it out. I'm 5'11 (200lbs) and feels good but at times a little cramped.  I'm not just talking about the trunk, I am talking about in the cabin too. the glove compartment is really small and the armrest storage is not deep at all. Also, the baby seat fits in the car but isn't as tight as I would personally like it... then again we take the Explorer for most long trips with the kids...Summary really fun car to drive and I wouldn't stress too hard on the electronics.

infiniti,q50,2014,keziapurrs, 06/25/2014,"Despite its shortcomings, I love my car",4,"I purchased my Q50 in mid-March. It was a demo with 1700 miles on it. The car was delivered pretty much flawless.
I love the look of the interior/exterior, and the feel/comfort of the car is outstanding. The navigation system has worked fine for me.
No mishaps, even driving on country roads.
The interior is nicely laid out and the technology ""concepts"" are awesome.
I just wish the ""In Touch"" did what it was marketed to do.
I made the mistake of speeding
up the delivery process since I had spent so much time in finance, so the salesman pitched the ""apps"" as if they worked.
That angers me.
But overall, I love my car and wouldn't trade it in for it's shortcomings."
infiniti,q50,2014,g35zman, 06/30/2015,Hate this car - can't wait to get rid of it,2,"I used to love the Infiniti brand and my Q50 is the forth one I have owned. Something has happened to Infiniti reliability over the last several years and it's moving in the wrong direction. The worst part is that Infiniti leadership doesn't seem to care. This is also the opinion of numerous Infiniti employees I have talked to.

What's good: great engine and performance. 

What's bad: electronics system is a hot mess. Has been in for repairs four times. The Infiniti InTouch system is a joke. The back of my trunk is already developing a rust spot and the car is barely over a year old. Problems with the electronic door locks that leave me out in the rain trying to get into my car!"
infiniti,q50,2014,alfstinky1, 09/20/2014,"NOISEY, POOR INFO SYSTEM",3,"I have owned this car for almost a year. Outstanding power, 15MPG city (NYC), 25 highway. Ride can be a little rough at times. Nice interior and outstanding BOSE sound system. Seat comfort and room is fine (6'1"").  
FOLLOW UP REVIEW: I have now had this car for two years. I have had the car in for two info system software updates with no success. After starting the car the info system fails to boot up a few times a month. When it does boot it takes forever for the icons to appear. There is also a time lag for the rear camera to come on after putting the car in reverse. The seat belt shoulder restraint fails to retract on the driver side. If you drop a passenger off that was sitting in the front passenger seat the seat belt warning sign comes on as though someone is in the seat without engaging their seat belt. I have been told by the dealer that the new models have a faster processor in the info system. The tire noise on concrete highways is the worst. You might as well turn the radio off because you can't hear it at all!!! I'm glad it's a lease. One year left.

infiniti,q50,2014,Rand Dent, 08/06/2017,2014 Q50s,5,"I had owned this car for less than a month, when it went in the shop at Harper Infiniti in Knoxville for recall issues. 
I own a BMW X5, and a  BMW CIC, and have owned BMWs and Mercedes for many years.  This Q50S is as fun to drive as either of my  vehicles, as well as all of the vehicles I have ever owned.
When my wife and I decided to buy another car we spent months researching BMW 535 xi, and Mercedes c300 sport 4matic and had taken a few out on test drives.Both are nice, but none were just right.  
As we researched additional vehicles my wife came across an Infiniti Q50S, which we also noticed that there was only one sport model for sale within a 400 miles radius.   That got our interest.  On a Friday afternoon we went to see this somewhat hard to find car, and drove the car for a couple hours and returned to the dealer.  That night we continued researching, and by Saturday morning we went back to the dealer to purchase the car.   Have not regretted it once.  Beautiful, comfortable,  strong running car and drives better than any other comparable vehicle I have ever driven.
Last year we decided to buy a crossover.  We came across a FX35, and purchased it on the spot.  Now our BMW CIC is parked covered in the driveway either of our inifinitis.

infiniti,q50,2014,Casey D., 03/23/2017,A gearhead's point of view.,5,"First of all, stomping on the throttle is AMAZING.  I love driving this car.  The handling is beautiful.  The brakes STOP the car very quickly. You should consider Infiniti more of a luxury sports car than a comfort car.   The front seats are soft on my butt and legs, WAAAAY better than our Mercedes GLK 350 which literally cause me pain in about 5 minutes of driving it.  I find the electronics intuitive, without the need to read a manual, which is totally different from my wife's 2014 Mercedes.  I love, love, love to drive this car.   The suspension is for driving fast in canyons, not to be confused for a fluffy marshmallow that you get in other luxury road cars. It handles bumps decently, about as good as my wife's Mercedes GLK 350, maybe even a little better. The MPG is reflective of the fact that Infiniti is squeezing EVERY bit of horsepower that they can out of this engine. If you want MPG, you need to get the Nissan Altima version of this car with 60 less horsepower.  The slow booting of the BlueTooth is mildly annoying, but I get to listen to that great exhaust note in the meantime :-) .  It has a nice little rumble when you start it up. This car was manufactured in 2014, so it may have less problems than those that were ""2014"" actually manufactured in 2013 (I hope).  I live in UT and have to drive up a steep, snowy hill in the wintertime that my FWD Camry barely makes on some days. I didn't want an SUV, which are more expensive anyway, and the price point was $12,000 dollars less than an AWD V6 Lexus.  I bought this as a Certified and bought the extended warranty, because I didn't want to pay when expensive electronics fail and I knew that Infiniti isn't as reliable as my Toyota's.  Caveat:  I've owned this less than a week, I can only speak about driving the car and nothing about reliability. The AC compressor started to howl when the climate control was on and they replaced it for a new one.  Within 3 months, it started to make noise again and it's getting louder so I will get it replaced again. If money wasn't an issue, I would have bought a Lexus GS.  If money isn't an issue with you, I would recommend that you buy a Lexus because the reliability will be light years ahead of this.

6 month update. I've put about 7k miles on it with a couple long road trips.  I still looooove driving this car and I giggle whenever I stomp on the throttle (which I do all the time). I wish that the suspension was a little softer, but it's supposed to be for cornering and it does that very well.

infiniti,q50,2014,Anita, 04/24/2018,Four Years and Loving My Q50,5,"I purchased this car new in 2014 and I have loved every minute of the four years! This car is awesome and fun to drive. This is my first Infiniti and I will purchase another, but I just don't want to part with the 3.7L V6 just yet. I shopped around for other premium sedans and found that for the styling, technology, performance and price, the Q50 is great!
It’s been more than 5 years andI still love this car. Basic maintenance only is required. I do recommend replacing the run flat tires with a all season tire for a much better ride.
"
infiniti,q50,2014,tageo, 05/02/2014,A Beautiful Machine,5,"I've had my car for 1 month now, and I am very impressed. The power and handling is excellent. The black on black looks sleek and mean. The interior quality is top notch, and it's full of nice options. Yes, the computer takes a bit of time to power up, but it's no big deal. You still have immediate access to the back-up camera, climate controls, and radio controls via the steering wheel buttons. Stop whining, people, and just enjoy driving this machine. Not a single problem with this car yet. I did not get the navigation, no need for it. And I don't know why people are complaining about the run flat tires. The tires are fine.
This car is simply fun to drive!"
infiniti,q50,2014,andrew714, 06/05/2015,Buyers Remorse....,2,"This is one of the biggest mistake ever. Not only did OC Infiniti ripped me off, they sold me a lemon. 

First and foremost, this car stinks. From the AC to the dead body order coming from the sunroof.  Apparently there is a TSB for the smell. Haven't taken the car in yet. This will be the 3rd time I've taken the car to the Dealership for the smell. 

The first 2 times was a waste of time. 

2nd, the car gets horrible MPG's. I'm avg 15mpg city driving. 

The steering wheel uses ""remote control steering"" technology. And it feels exactly like it sounds. Ever played with a remove control car from the 99 cent store? The steering wheel control in this 50k car has the same feel. CRAP!"
infiniti,q50,2014,Oren, 11/09/2015,Super Cruiser,5,"Extraordinary highway cruiser.

infiniti,q50,2014,Travis, 02/07/2018,Best car ever,5,"This is the best driving car I've ever owned. I have driven it a little over 5,000 miles and on a couple long trips. The only issue has been once  the steering pulled to the the left and a few weeks later to the right,  like the front was out of alignment. Both times it was random and went away after a few minutes. This car is very quick, nimble and fun to drive. I especially like merging into fast moving traffic. The acceleration will push you firlmy into your seat. Perhaps if you drove this car on a track the drive by wire steering would be an issue, but for everyday street driving its been great. Also, the brakes are “grabby” but are fine once you get used to them.
"
infiniti,q50,2014,personalfeel, 12/28/2014,Unpredictable,3,"I traded in my 2013 Accord 4 cyl with the q50 hybrid. I regret for my decision. The acceleration is uneven especially at lower speed and in the city. The transition from hybrid to gasoline is abrupt and feel embarrassed because even the passengers can feel it and questioned if there's anything wrong with the car. The acceleration is unpredictable at lower speed and there were many times, I felt the car lunge forward when I only step on the pedal just a little and other times, I had to step on it hard before it will take off. After driving for 5000 miles, I felt the car a lot heavier than the accord and the handling is not that much better which I expected more from a RWD."
infiniti,q50,2014,showguy, 08/12/2016,Do not buy if you have any regard for saftey .,2,"I am a 6 time Infiniti owner who made the ill fated mistake of leasing a loaded (every possible option) 2014 Q50S. I am not going to get into the widely reviewed issues with the rushed out, garbage InTouch system or the take you life in your hands DAS steering wonder.  
On the good side, the car is very attractive, well designed and performs well. That's where it ends.  The noise level on the inside is equal to that of riding on a train.  The factory supplied (long gone) run flat tires are noisy as hell, are blow out prowen (4 in 2 years). The passenger side seat rattles, the backup and front cameras are total mud and have long delays going on and going off.  All of these issues when taken into the dealer and logging complaints with Infiniti have been answered with the typical Infiniti response "" CAN NOT REPLICATE""
Now 27 months into a 39 month lease my car has been the shop for 5 weeks.  The brake pedal will sink to the floor after a 20 mile or so drive. The car does stop, but it stops long and feels unstable. The dealer has replaced the master cylinder after 3 times of doing nothing except for giving me the old "" CAN NOT REPLICATE"" Now it is the shop again waiting for define intervention from Infiniti.
On top of that there is well known issues with the airbag system on this car. 3 Recalls later and 2 malfunction lights I can't say with confidence that they work.
In the end, if you are looking for a quality car in the $55,000+ range and you have any value for your sanity and the life of you and your loved ones, run away from this car, this manufacture and their dealer network.  I thought I would never write such a review on Infiniti.  They have betrayed me and thousands of faithful followers.

infiniti,q50,2014,Louise, 08/04/2017,Disappointed - some major issues,3,"Bought the car at Infiniti in Georgia with just over 10,000 miles. It's a 2014 and I bought it in mid 2015. I average about 60 miles per day. Here are the problems: 1 - about 8 months after I bought the car so in 2016, I noticed the window button having cracked. Doesn't affect the use, but I feel the crack every time I go to use it. Shouldn't happen at this price and age of a ""luxury"" car. 2 - in late 2016, the driver side window started making a horrid squealing sound when it gets wet and it's opened/closed. Again...shouldn't happen at this price and age of a ""luxury"" car. 3 - the back seat row has the middle foldable cup holder that comes out of the back and behind it is a piece of what seems like a sturdy piece of plastic fold-able piece separates the trunk and the seat when the cup holders are down. Well this broke and came out the second time the cup holder was used. Shouldn't happen at this price and age of a ""luxury"" car in my humble opinion. 4 - at about 59,500 miles the check engine light came on and upon starting the car excessive white smoke comes out of the exhaust. Made appointment with dealership and after 6 hrs they can't find ANYTHING wrong other than it's about 4 quarts low on oil and it needs back breaks. They must have reset the check engine light. A week later, engine light comes back on and I take it back to dealer at 60,003 miles. This is where magic happens. An hour into sitting at the dealer, they discover the engine is so full of sludge that I just plain and simple need a new engine. It's worth to point out that bumper-to-bumper expires at 60,000 miles.  Amazing. Now we have to argue that we should not pay for the engine. It was brought in while under bumper-to-bumper and really, a new engine shouldn't happen at this price and age of a ""luxury"" car!! Of course I'm being accused of not changing oil frequently enough, however they will be receiving receipts to prove that I've done my part. 5 - 4 months ago I had the back brakes changed and now are being told I urgently need new brakes again. Should break pads wear down in 4 months? Never owned a car where the breaks wear in 4 months and my driving habits/patterns hasn't changed much in the past 15 years. 5 - the back up camera doesn't always work. Some days it just chooses to be black until next start up. For me, these are too many problems for a car in this price range. I have owned a Nissan Xterra and a QX80 and I have loved the durability and quality, but this car has made me skeptic of the brand and quality. I buy my cars and I keep them for years. The Xterra I had for 12 years with near 200,000 miles and never had any issues other than regular maintenance. The Q80 I had for 18 months before trading in for a smaller more gas efficient Q50. Disappointed in the brand and the declining quality, along with poor Inifiniti customer service from both dealer and corporate. Next car will be trying a Tesla and hoping for better quality and care on that one since Infiniti has disappointed.

infiniti,q50,2014,CoffeeBean, 09/11/2015,Having owned both the Q50 2014 and the 2015...,5,"This review is coming from someone who likes to drive aggressively. Two thumbs up.

2 cars ago I had a 2010 VW GTI. Loved it, 'til I drove it (almost literally) to the ground. It had to have a new engine at 80k mi, so instead, I was then in the market for a new vehicle. I've always liked smaller cars and their handling and steering, so this was somewhat of a big step to take to go with a ""mid-size sports luxury sedan.""

I had the 2014 Q50 for a year and I really liked it; I upgraded to a 2015 Q50 with a few more options (they took my 2014 as a trade-in). I'd never driven an Infiniti before the 2014 Q50, but my friend has/had a Nissan Maxima, another friend had an Infiniti M37, and a friend has an Infiniti EX37. My friends' opinions about the reliability of Infiniti kind of persuaded me to try it, and I'm glad I did.

It is ""less connected"" to the road, especially with the way I want to drive, but I still enjoy it, but this means a softer, smoother ride--a comfy drive. My friend even commented on the smooth suspension as a passenger (although, he had a BMW 3-series, so that's a pretty big difference). The big 327HP V6 engine is pretty powerful. With a 3 adult passengers and a trunk full of luggage, the Q50 still has no trouble accelerating quickly.

The Bose surround sound is pretty nice; very similar to Nissan's. You have to play around with the sound settings to get it just the way you like it (took me about a week). Sometimes the bass can be too loud; depends on what kind of music you listen to.

Navigation is decent. Back-up camera is good (and the display is big too).

Note: There is a big difference between the non-premium version and the premium version of the Q50, the premium version has steer-by-wire, which gives it a much more disconnected feel. You get used to it after a while (of all the loaner cars I've ever gotten), but they are drastically different. My Q50 does not have steer-by-wire. If money were not an obstacle, I would've gotten the Q50S for the sport suspension/tuning.

infiniti,q50,2014,Disappointed driver, 01/18/2016,Buyer beware defects,1,"I leased a beautiful red Q50 hybrid in October 2014.  We live in Wisconsin. In January 2015, the steering froze due to arctic weather in Wisconsin 0 degrees. Dealer had car for over a month to repair. International Infiniti couldn't be bothered with replacing said defective car. Fast forward to January 2016. Guess what?  The steering does not work again. Hmm. You need steering in all climates. Do not buy this car under any circumstance.  

Brakes do not stop well if you hit a bump. The electronics do not work properly. The fuel economy for a hybrid isn't worth the extra money. Infiniti should recall all of these cars until the defect is fixed. This car will kill someone.

I drove a fully loaded 2008 infiniti G35 sedan before this one (now its my work car lol). I love infiniti's because they are reliable, fast, fun, and stylish! So far I've put 6k miles on it & it has been a dream to drive.. i mean infiniti really outdone itself this time. Everything is excellent (seriously), infiniti's version of the i-drive system is very simple , not too much of a learning curb at all. All the driving modes really help, i have the hybrid so i avg 32 mpg on gas with 354 horses :) .. no words can describe how great this car is, don't believe me? Go test drive one, the infiniti Q50 won't let you down ."
infiniti,q50,2014,ocd168, 11/30/2014,A compromised sport sedan,2,"After leasing the car for about 6 months, 5k miles, here's my assessment. Accelerating from standstill is great, the electric motor really provides a smooth takeoff combined with the gas engine for the power. In ""sport"" mode it is fast (0-60 in 4.9s). However, taking turns or windy road is a different matter, I never feel the car is planted like the 3-series, car feels unstable at times. Sometimes the auto brake, lane departure tech get in the way of driving, I usually turn it off on local streets. The lane departure prevention is of little use because when the lane curves too much it won't correct for you. The touch-screen computer is extremely SLOW, needs a faster processor."
infiniti,q50,2014,Long Trip Commuter, 05/06/2016,Finding a used treasure,5,"I gave up a G35 for the mileage benefit of a fully loaded Nissan Altima Hybrid, which I rode for 6 years.  I returned to Infiniti in desire of muscle, but having been spoiled by the MPG of the Altima Hybrid.  Purchasing the Q50 Hybrid Sport AWD at ~33% discount to its new cost after just 11,000 miles, I was able to return to the sporty comfort of Infiniti giving up just 5mpg and gaining updated controls and muscle. Two weeks into ownership, I find myself, enjoying the ride, comfortable on the road, driving at 65mph, less in a rush to get anywhere, and knowing that with a tap of the pedal in sport mode, I can pass most all cars on the road and beat almost any car through the intersection as the red light turns green.

infiniti,q50,2014,Pee, 02/27/2018,Awesome car!,4,"I’ve had this car for quite a while now and I still really enjoy it. The performance is great, engine is very strong, transmission is super smooth and the brakes work very well too. The seats can be uncomfortable on longer rides, my FX had much comfier  ones.  I have a spare tire and the trunk is a lot smaller which is a little inconvenient at times. The headlights work extremely well and are very bright. The navigation isn’t bad in my opinion but I don’t use it much. It also annoys me that you can’t use it while driving but I guess that’s common. The car takes about a minute or two to boot up but it doesn’t bother me. I’ve never tried to use the apps so I can’t comment on that. The car has given me zero issues as far as reliability and I don’t intend it to. I’ve never had an issue with my previous Infiniti’s. The back wheels tend to slip a little in wet weather but it does handle good in the snow. Overall I would recommend and I think it makes a great used car  "
infiniti,q50,2014,Grant Hites, 05/17/2019,Infiniti Q50 hybrid sport,5,"This car is awesome. I have owned this car for almost three years. I now have 159k miles (I drive a lot for work). Literally the only repairs I have done except oil changes were a front ball joint and brakes. That is pretty good considering the mileage and FYI don’t go to Infiniti dealers to get repairs done other then oil changes(run about $60). This car drives just like it should just took on a vacation over 1100 miles one way. Got over 475 miles on a tank mind you this car has AWD and 360 hp. Mind you this car is fast it can do 0-60 in 4.8 seconds what other cars can get that mpg and go this far on a tank of gas? None absolutely none.   Also my car has the deluxe touring package this car can literally drive itself. This package consists of adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, around view camera, blind spot, adaptive headlights, auto-dimming mirrors, parking sensor front and rear and navigation.  I would never own another car ever without all these driving aids. I have owned 3 Infiniti’s and you better believe I will keep this thing until the wheels falls off. There is no other car I would rather have and drive everyday. This car is awesome In the snow. My only complaints are when driving in stop and go traffic the car can be annoyingly jumping going from electric mode to gas mode. It’s not the smoothest but luckily I don’t drive in those conditions very often.

Update:
Traded car for another. Got a great deal on a one owner with 49k miles.

infiniti,q50,2014,Kyle, 08/15/2018,Worst car I've ever owned,1,"I had 2007 Infiniti M35 for 7 years and over 185,000 miles.  The Bluetooth was useless, it went through brakes pretty fast and gas mileage wasn't great, but other than that it was a great car.  So, when it was time to get a new car, I bought the first model year of the Q50 hybrid.  Over the life of the car the drive-by-wire steering failed, the audio system never worked properly, the Bluetooth was useless, the transition from electric to gas was very rough, the gas engine would suddenly rev up while sitting at a stop light shaking the car, the car would actually speed up if you didn't push down on the brake hard enough, the car would shudder when accelerating out of a turn with neither gas nor electric engine knowing what to do and the mud flaps kept falling off.  I participated in two Nissan factory studies on engine performance and the exhaust system, which really made me feel like I was driving the beta version of this car.  After being told repeatedly ""that's just the way the car was designed"", I learned to live with all its deficiencies.  I was planning on selling the car before 100,000 miles, but since it hadn't really held its value very well, I decided to just drive it into the ground.  I didn't have to wait very long.  At 101,806 miles, 1,806 miles beyond the warranty, the hybrid battery overheated and needed to be replaced.  (I was one of 5 towed into the dealership that day with the same problem.)  That ""part"" cost $12,000!  With labor to install it, the total price was going to be $14,000.  The appraisal I'd gotten from CarMax just 200 miles earlier was $11,000.  Obviously it made no sense to repair it.  The dealership, Infiniti of Montclair, had no interest in helping me and suggested I get an attorney to escalate the matter.  Despite having owned and faithfully serviced Infiniti cars for the previous 11 1/2 years, Infiniti consumer affairs refused to buy the car back for a fair trade-in value or to even help out on the cost of the new battery.  I wound up having to sell this $50,000 luxury automobile with 101,806 miles on it for salvage value.  DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER INFINITI PRODUCT.

It is fun to drive. Performance and handling are great. The interior is well appointed and comfortable. It looks and feels luxurious. 
The major disappointment with this car is the Infiniti InTouch system. This system is used to control the navigation, climate, and audio systems. The system is takes a long time to first boot up and then is slow to respond to user input. 
The worst part is that it crashes and locks up all the controls. This was improved with a software upgrade but is still an issue. It's not fun when the navigation system gets reset while following route directions."

Bottom line, over a year later I have to reboot the computer (turn the car off and on and it takes 45 seconds to boot) because the center console is blank, radio doesn't work, sensors for detecting near objects (like my garage posts) don't stop beeping, radio cuts in and out (not reception), apps don't work.... need I say more?

We upgraded from a G37x to this car, some of the difference are that the Q50 is a bit lower in the back, the wind noise is very irritating, but no complaints about the run flats. They are designed like that, they will give you a bit more of a road noise than regular tires. Over all... happy campers with this car!!

infiniti,q50,2014,Michael, 07/07/2016,Very Disappointing,2,"I was one of the first buyers of the Q50 at the end of 2013 and I bought it because I wanted a sedan and loved the styling. There are several problems with the Q50 but first, the things I like. I definitely have felt safe in the car despite having to have it towed (only once) because the steering started to click it couldn't seem to find it's feet. This only happened once and Infiniti fixed it and paid for the tow. It's a solid car. However, it rides rough, it's noisey, and the worst part is that display/navigation is very unresponsive. It's incredibly annoying to push on the screen and taking as long as 10 seconds to accept the response. I've had the car now for 3 1/2 years and Infiniti has yet to correct this. Whoever designed where the USB port was put must have been a contortionist because it's almost useless. The navigation is stupid and not at all intuitive. Additionally, for the life of me, I cannot understand why I can't make ""Eco-Drive"" the default??? You always have to start in ""Standard"" mode. I believe the Q70 drives better and will consider it when my lease is up but unless I were to get a screaming deal, I probably would move on to another brand.

infiniti,q50,2014,srq5363, 06/11/2014,Well...it looks good...,3,"I leased the base model with the sunroof about 1.5 weeks ago.
I didn't want to pay for (or deal with) the electronic issues and gizmos and the base version hit my target price.
It looked great, drove well, and met my needs for size.
The downside is this car smells...bad.
Two others like it smelled bad, too, but the dealership claimed that whatever I was smelling would wear off or they'd take care of it.
After a few days, I returned and was told there was nothing they could do and I could trade it, lemon law it, or try to air it out.
No luck.
Software is buggy and slow and they are still saying apps are coming in 1 more month.
I'm regretting my choice but, at least it looks good.

Update 6/16
Infiniti let me down.  I thought they were a class act but they are not.  After a long period of denial, they finally acknowledged they had a problem with the smell coming from the drainage system around the sunroofs of the Q50.  Once they replaced it, the smell lingered for a while but eventually went away.  Unfortunately, they wouldn't do anything about the electronics.  Still slow to load and buggy as can be.  So, where even cheap cars will have guide lines on their backup cameras as soon as you shift, with the Q50 you have to wait like two minutes.  The clock will sometimes show only a face with no hands because the computer has lost the time/date.  The radio stations you've programmed will sometimes just disappear.  The automatic climate control will just stop functioning and you have to reboot the computer.  Most of the available functionality and features won't work (internet, email, text, etc.)  None of it is end of world stuff...just annoying for the most expensive car I've ever purchased/leased.  To be fair, I enjoy driving it as far as driving goes.  The power is there when you want it, it's comfortable, no complaints there.  Still like the way it looks, too.  The headlights don't reach out enough on low beam which can be hazardous, though.  I've noticed a few times that the sensor for the passenger seat airbag wasn't working properly and, as it turns out, I just received a notice of a recall on that issue.  I don't regret getting it, I enjoy driving it, but every time I consider that I could have purchased a much cheaper car with more features and functionality, I feel like it was a mistake I won't make again.  I will not buy a car that doesn't work fully again or from a company that has the nerve to say ""that's just the way it was designed"" when something is clearly not right.  I had a few Accords before this and all were great cars for a lot less money.

I bought the Q50 when it first came out and has had these issues:


1. Slow responsiveness of touch screen.
2. GPS loosing signal and going to a blank screen.
3. Electric steering locking while in drive (major safety issue!)
4. Doors locking and not able to get into our out of the car!

When we purchased the Q50 in early October 2013, we knew there were issues with the computer system.
The salesperson told us that there would be a fix in November and we would be contacted.
During October and November, we experienced a range of issues with the navigation system and one touch system.
We had to reboot the system almost every time we drove the car.
We were not contacted for the fix in November or December and we started to experience many steering issues.
My wife contacted the Pittsburgh Infiniti dealer to no avail. I guess they were waiting for someone to be killed by the steering problem before taking action.
Review update - 8/12/2016: we have owned the car now for almost three years.  It has never lived up to our expectations.  Cochran Infiniti (where we bought it) has not helped with liking the car.  There have been many recalls on the steering and overall technology package on the car.  The updates to the computer are poor or simply do not work after they have been performed.  Either the dealer has poor techs or the updates suck.  Not only will I never buy another Infiniti, I will not buy anything from Cochran.

infiniti,q50,2015,rogue36, 09/02/2015,"Loved my G's, but the Q50 is a beaut!",5,"I've owned 5 Infiniti G-Series vehicles over the past 12 years, starting with the original G35 in 2003.  Needless to say, I love the car.  I've always preferred its styling, comfort, and value compared to other entry luxury sedans.  I was hesitant to get a Q50 after reading the bad press it received, but the new styling really appealed to me and the technology in my 2012 G37 was feeling old (particularly the audio/navigation system).  After several test drives of the Q50 and its competitors, I liked the Audi A4 the best, but only slightly more than the Q50 and the lease deal on the Q50 was so much better there was no way I could pass it up.  Looking back, I'm glad I didn't get an A4 -- its styling is so boring compared to the Q50.

Overall I really like the Q50.  The powertrain is excellent - smooth acceleration and quiet at highway speeds.  The cabin is comfortable with nice feel to the materials, supportive seats, minimal wind and road noise, and good visibility.  The Bose ""studio on wheels"" is thankfully just as good as it was in the G37.  I didn't get the Technology Package (which I somewhat regret) so I can't comment on all the cool ADAS features.  I like the car, but I do have two reservations: the steer-by-wire system, and the infotainment system.

I wanted Around View Monitor to help with parking in my cluttered garage, and I really like entry/exit assist where the seats and steering wheel move out of the way to make getting in & out of the car easier, but to get these two features I had to take the ""direct adaptive steering"" system.  I'm not a professional driver, but even I can easily feel the difference between DAS and the hydraulic steering gears used on the G-series in the past, and I prefer the old steering feel.  That said, it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I use this car for my daily commute on boring mostly-straight highways.  After three months I can honestly say I've gotten used to the DAS feel and it doesn't bother me anymore.  In fact I appreciate the lightness of the steering while making low-speed maneuvers.  I did however have one incident where I was taking a tightly curved on-ramp at excessive speed just for the fun of it (which I did all the time in my G's) and in the middle of the maneuver I felt the car turn in slightly without me moving the steering wheel.  It scared the heck out of me.  I don't know if it was the DAS system making an adjustment, or  something else happening, but it was very disconcerting.  Bottom line: DAS makes me nervous and I would prefer not to have it.

As for the infotainment system, it has a nice set of features but the execution is bad, not terrible, but bad.  I have a lot of complaints about the system, but I'll limit myself to just mentioning two of them: 1) When listening to HD Radio the song title and artist name do not appear on any screen anywhere.  Not on the radio screen, not on the navigation screen, and not on the instrument cluster screen.  It's ridiculous.  I eventually found that information buried two levels deep in the ""controls"" menu, where it makes no sense for it to be and is basically useless.  When you listen to music from your phone or iPod the song title, artist name, and even album art are prominently displayed -- why wouldn't they do the same for HD Radio?  Even more crazy, if you turn HD Radio off you do get the song title and artist name displayed - though in the old style scrolling text format.  It's really frustrating and I hope Infiniti offers a software update to fix it.  2) I like to put my iPod or phone into random mode and just manually cycle through my songs.  Weirdly, in the Q50 there is a span of time where you can't hit ""next"" to go to the next song -- the system says ""retrieving album art"" and won't respond no matter how many times you hit the button.  That window of time seems to be from 1 - 3 seconds after a song starts playing, which
 can really be annoying when I hear a song I rather not listen to and want to quickly skip to the next one.  I either have to hit ""next"" immediately or wait 3 seconds.  It's a minor thing, but still, didn't anyone do user testing on the system?

Anyway, it is a great car and I am happy with my purchase.  I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a sporty rear-wheel drive (or rear-wheel biased AWD) sedan and wants something that looks more elegant and interesting than the boring German sedans.

infiniti,q50,2015,SS, 08/08/2015,Overlooked Option,5,"Update:  almost at the 3 year mark and the car has been worked flawless.  I did change out the run flats for conventional tires which softened the ride a bit. AWD system works great here in Minnesota.  Electric motor provides a ton a torque for quick acceleration. My lease will be up soon but I’ll probably change to something with a bit more room.  Lack of storage is a downside.

This car was panned pretty heavily when it came out in '14.   There were some first generation issues that for the most part have been fixed.  Great highway ride.  Not a fan of run-flat tires - probably my only gripe.  Steering system is awesome.  There were a lot of critics of the wireless steering in terms of feel.  You would have to test it yourself to see but personally I like it.  Long drives don't wear on you.    Cross winds don't impact your driving line.  Bumps/potholes don't jar the steering wheel.  And the power the hybrid delivers is impressive.  Not to mention pretty good mpg as well.  Add in a nice audio system and all-wheel drive and you have a great ride.

infiniti,q50,2015,Christopher Bradham, 10/22/2015,Former G owner,5,"First of all the car  is awesome. I am a former BMW guy and owned an 2008 G35 fully loaded. The 2015 Q50 did not replace all that I had in my G such as an actual power steering wheel adjustment. The Q has a manual lever. Premium leather in my G Leatherette in the Q (not a bad thing).  Memory seats, lumbar support on driver side in the G not for the Q. Cd changer in the trunk (not a big deal anymore) 

But overall more cabin room and the 7 speed transmission is a beast. Not too bad on gas on highway. Love it and feel I made the right decision.

infiniti,q50,2015,Nick J, 04/25/2016,Probably the best car in its class,4,"A lot of reviewers and car magazines like to brag on and on about the road feel and handling of a BMW 3 series. But most people in the real world aren't driving their car on a racetrack, a mountain road or trying to set a lap time. 
The Audi A4 doesn't even compare to this car in any way. This is more spacious, more powerful, and the quality of the material and fit and finish is on par. The S4 however, is a better car. 
The same story with the 3-series. When compared to a 328, the Q50 is definitely the better car. A 335 is a better performance machine, but the ride and comfort is sacrificed in the name of performance. 
If you're looking for a great balance of luxury and sport, but you don't want to fork over $50k or more (Audi S4, BMW 335i, etc.) This is the best car in its class.

infiniti,q50,2015,Catucho, 09/12/2018,Get all service records before buying used,2,"I bought  a 2015 Q50 Premium with a little over 28,500 two months ago. The car was still under the original manufacturer warranty for another 11 months or up to 60,000 miles. In addition to a test drive I checked the carfax for the car. It stated that a previous Infiniti dealer had completed a CPO inspection at 28,038 miles and sold it as a CPO. 
With less that 500 miles under my possession the car had catalytic converter problems wich infinity took care of. A week ago the engine started hesitating and the low oil pressure light came on. I got the car on a flatbed and took it to the dealer. Well, the car needs a new engine and Infiniti refuses to cover the repairs required due to oil sludge inside the engine. They claim that the car was not properly serviced.
The car has actually 28,768 miles. I am now in the quest to find all service records from the previous owner to go back to Infiniti and dispute their claims. I did find that many others had had similar problems with sludge buildup in their Infinitis. Some of them were covered by warranty only after a lawyer got involved. So the moral is: if you are thinking on buying a used Infiniti, think again or at least demand all service records, even if the car has very few miles on it.

infiniti,q50,2015,Mark D, 04/16/2016,Surprised how much I like it.,4,"My wife's Lexus IS250AWD just came to end of lease and in shopping around we stumbled almost by accident into the Infiniti dealer. After talking about the different models we test drove the Q50 and QX50. Very surprised by the Q50 3.7L. I wasn't expecting such a throaty warble from the engine, tight, direct steering and well equipped interior for the price. We have had it only about a month but, very nice.

infiniti,q50,2015,Ray, 06/01/2016,the capability to be good but not a bad car,4,"While shopping i was deciding between a 2015 Hyundai genesis sedan and a few other cars. I came across the q50 liking the old G models. ENded up with the Q because of the boring feel of the genesis. The q50 is marginally faster only because the transmission tuning is terrible at best. Pedal to the floor my 06 IS350 and the genesis sedan both downshift instantly to the right gear and puts the power down. The Q50 on the other hand has to build the revs up from cruising around 2k rpm's to about 6k to rev match, and it feels like an eternity. It never really knows what gear to go into when trying to do a smooth pass from 40 to 55 mph. I have reset the ecu so it could relearn based on my driving, it has improved but is still erratic. It either stays in a high gear then just bogs or downshifts too much and jumps out where you have to come off the gas quickly to compensate.
The premium Bose system is awesome much better than the earlier version in my old Maxima. I listen to a variety of music and it handles everything pretty well. I added an additional sub just to get those deeper lows but the sound is not lacking from factory, its crystal clear. The apps are a gimmick its best to use your phone when your parked versus having the intouch system do a google search. USB and ipod work very well and have clean sound and amplification. Bluetooth audio works seamlessly and gives access to phone for browsing on the screen versus using the actual phone.
Build quality is not on par with lexus or bmw parts feel a bit cheaper and less sturdy. Cabin noise is low even at highway speeds. tire noise is not bad for run flats but the ride quality greatly suffers. For a 55 series tire it rides like a 35 minus the performance benefits. I will be changing to standard tires once these wear out. plus the 17 inch wheels look too small for the car 18s or the 19 inch sports are a much better option.
Trunk space is marginally bigger than my is350 but the backseat is far more spacious. If the new Lexus IS wasn't so ugly i would have looked into one but i feel like i will go back to lexus versus Infiniti. Possibly even move to BMW before i buy another Infiniti. The q50 is no where near a bad car but it has a lot of bugs that need to worked out. THE GAS MILEAGE IS ALSO NO WHERE NEAR STATED. I get average 22 with 80% highway (70-80mph) 20% city (45mph). Driving the same routes/ speeds my is350 averages 25 highway and 18 city. the q50 is around 23 highway using premium only.

infiniti,q50,2015,JB, 09/23/2015,Bought my q50s awd with Nav and Deluxe package.,4,"I got my q50s awd early of September. 
First of all, car's performance is the best within this price range. In terms of accerelation, braking, and handling, they are good enough to be called ""Japanese BMW"".
I also own 2015 Acura TLX with SH-AWD and compare it to Q50s, TLX has much better comfort ride quality. Q50S's noise is quite noticeable and legroom, head room and back seats are not big enough as TLX. There is a lot of controversy on Direct Adaptive Steering system and to be honest, most of drivers would not even notice and it also offers precise and quick handling. Please do not mind about this system. However, the fact that you have to get all the way to tech package (you have to get another two packages in order to get this)  in order to get simple safety features such as blind spot monitoring system is quite annoying and its back up camera seems to fuzzy specially during the night (my 2014 honda civic ex has much better quality). However, this car still has a lot of standard features that are usually optional in some of other competitors. 
Q50S suppose to be sport car and I think Infiniti has done a great job with that. 
If you want comfort, smooth and easy riding, this car isnt great for you. Q50s is really for driving enthusiast who drives a lot to be afraid of owning BMW. 
BTW, if you are going to get Q50, make sure to get ""S"". its worth the price ! 19inch wheel, 4piston caliper, special front bumpers and sport front seats that also have manual thigh support!

infiniti,q50,2015,Philippe, 12/02/2015,a ghost in my car !!! (2),4,"I bought the Q50 hybrid last year. I have only 5000 miles after one year. last month, I rode the car to go to a medical appointment. I was at 60mph when the car started to go on the right by itself and started to brake multiple times creating a bumpy ride. it was a nightmare. I called the dealer and brought the car there.
They called the next monday to tell me that they uploaded the new version of the software and it was fixed....I am scared now no matter what.

New Update Dec 2nd 2016: althought I had a ghost in my car, it is now fixed by the magic of the reprogramming. The car is nice, good handling, good performance and especially good gas consumption (26~27mpg on the road, 32mpg in the highway).

new update June 2017: no more issue. good car with good acceleration and great comfort.

infiniti,q50,2015,FotG, 04/26/2016,"Unpredictable acceleration, uneven stops",2,"There is very little consistency from where you put the pedal and how the car accelerates. The standard transmission mode is the most consistent and the most driveable. The sport mode is so wildly unpredictable that it's pretty much unusable. Sometime the car takes off like a rocket, and some times there is a 2-3 second delay before anything happens.  The braking is uneven and when between 30 and 40 miles per hour there is a sudden decrease in acceleration force and the brake pedal has to be pressed much harder. The transmission is too aggressive at shifting up to higher gears making it hard to maintain a constant speed. I read the reviews of this car and saw it was a love it or hate it kind of car, but I was not expecting it to be so unpredictable. Strangely enough, nearly all of these problems go away if you shift manually, but it also disables EV mode. Software in the car seems rough around the edges and as if it was rushed to production. They are typically small problems but they get annoying after awhile. Ex: dash screen and top screen remember what you last set them to, bottom screen doesn't. Won't remember your selected drive mode. One thing I do like is the direct adaptive steering. But only in the heavy/quick mode. The standard mode gets twitchy when making quick left then right turns (such as an apartment parking lot).

The bottom line, I would not buy this car again, acceleration and braking are too unpredictable, which are consistent with a surprisingly high amount of car reviews. I didn't notice any of these issues in the test drive. My advice is get a weekend demo if you are looking into this car.

Not much torque, but still mid 5's to get to 60 MPG. It's a little bumpy with the run flat 19's. What makes it a great car is the low cost lease. Why drive a used car when you can get a new car in mid 300's per month? If you get the Non sport model, it is in the low 300's per month.

infiniti,q50,2015,Rich, 03/14/2016,Timing is everything,4,"2015 Q50 Sport model. Sticker price over 49k but under $390/mo with under 3000 upfront money including taxes. I think low price reflects Infinity unloading 2015's to make room for 2016's. That will be my strategy from now on. 
My prior lease was 2014 Lexus IS 250. This Infinity blows that car away with size, power (duh), comfort and superior navigation and radio features. 
Seats 5, but middle of rear seat over drive shaft is way too high and uncomfortable for anyone unlucky enough to be sitting there for an extended drive.
Climate control seems pretty accurate with transition from cold weather to unseasonably warm weather happening with minimal input on my part. I always felt comfortable.
Can't say anything about mpg since I haven't had the car long enough. The mpg' are climbing steadily and it looks like I can get to 25 mpg without much effort. Something I could not do in my Lexus no matter how hard I tried.
The 5 drive modes are pretty cool with sport mode pushing out some hefty acceleration with a bit of a throaty roar from the exhaust (we're not talking Mustang roar here though). The economy mode (where I do most of my driving), looks like I can get up to 30 mpg...but we'll see about that.
All in all, I'm pretty happy with the car.

I drive normally, standard wear and tear expected, but to have to change my run flat tires, front break pads, rotors, back rotors cut, etc and cough up $1600 in mid lease and less than 23k miles is unheard of!!! Terrible. What's worse, I tried to contact Infiniti and complain,  they put the blame on me as if my driving pattern etc. But I ask, if it's my driving pattern,  why is this the first leased car I had to maintain the way it requires?  I'm so dissapointed because overall, hoping someone would have reimbursed me etc.  Again, with brakes, I noticed something was wrong when the car would shake.

It's been about a month and still no buyer's remorse. True it's quite a bit different than the MkVI VW GTI, but there are only two things I miss, the hatchback and the manual transmission. I know, completely different category of vehicles but the GTI is what I traded in on the deal. The infotech is still taking some getting used to but I just feel downright spoiled every day I drive it. Oh, and just pressing a button to lock the doors and start the car. That 7500 RPM redline, AWD, comfort, and luxuries. Still can't believe I got a chance to own one.

infiniti,q50,2015,Greg, 07/10/2015,New to Infiniti,4,"When we looked at new cars in 2013, we were interested in the G37, but found that the Q50 had just been introduced.  It had all of the options we wanted (AWD, strong power, look of luxury) so we opted for the new model instead of the outgoing G model.  Overall the car is great with the exception of electronic systems that are the center piece of the interior.  I have never seen a car's systems take so long to come online.  Once you start the car, at best, all of the radio functions will finally become available after about 30 seconds to a minute.  Also (and I find this to be hazard that Infiniti should fix), the back-up sensors and grid also take about 30 seconds to a minute to become available.  When you are in a crowded shopping area and your first action when leaving is to back out of the parking spot, all safety systems should be immediately available.  Our other car's (not an Infiniti) backup systems, radio and all other electronics are immediately available at the turn of the ignition.  Even when the electronics are available, the Q50 has several glitches.  When we first got the car, the radio would ""freeze"", meaning once you turned to a station, you could not switch stations or even turn the volume down without stopping the car, turning it off and restarting.  I think they finally fixed that issue with one of the several updates, but we still have glitches in the radio and controls from time to time.  I think the Q50's navigation system is significantly better than the one in our other car and is extremely user-friendly and easy to use while driving.

Overall a good car with impressive power, comfort and other features, but as a new model, it has some needed improvements that likely will not be available for another model year or two.  Will consider another one when we look again, but will also explore the competitors again as we are not 100% sold.

infiniti,q50,2015,ghtrum, 08/27/2015,"A Driver's car, updated",5,"Updated review:  Made it to 6 months and my first oil change.  It seems everyday I see or feel something else of a positive note on this car.  Lately, I have noticed a very positive feel while moving through a specific curve, where anything over 35 would cause a car to push through the curve.  This car drifts in a very confident and positive fashion.  I am still quite glad I chose this car.  If you are a driver's driver, you should try this car.  In this price range, I consider this a better value than competitors like BMW.  Truth:  19 inch tires, upgraded brakes, Premium, RWD drive.  I purposedly chose the NON drive by wire, as I had a really BAD experience with another Infiniti that had drive by wire.  The NON drive by wire, has excellent road manners, great steering control and road feel, great shift points, and wonderful braking.  I find myself in tight turns still able to make micro shifts to the curve such that the line I have picked out is more efficiently used.  (It took 1200 miles and 3 months to get to the present performance and appreciation for my part)  Though there are two taller gears than the Coupe model, I find the accleration and shift points to be more than adequate.
Though others have found the dual electronics screen distracting, I have found the opposite.  With most things you need to do, like change the audio device or radio station, there are 2 or 3 ways to get it done.  I find that I can keep my attention on my driving, while my fingers find a handy device to make the change. 
The car seats will appeal to most people, but I can only give them 4/5.   I only have two negatives:  I hate run flat tires (bumpy, noisy), and I do not like how totally quiet the cabinet is.  There is barely any exhaust note or engine tone I can hear inside the cabin.  The G37 coupe is more appealling in that regard.  I bought the car with several misgivings, but they have mostly gone away, replaced by a real appreciation for this car that melds with my driving needs.

"
infiniti,q50,2015,Tim, 04/18/2019,It's OK at Best,3,"Let me begin by saying I had leased a G37x prior to my Q50 AWD that I adored. Sure, the styling was 7 years old and it def. needed a refresh, but re-designing a car should be a step forward, not two back. Beyond a few first world gripes, I never had a single issue with the G.

I don't really know where to begin with the Q50 in terms of what I didn't like, so I'll start out with the positives:
1. It was fast. Stoplights were its best friend. The sound that engine made as it sang through the gears was fantastic. 
2. The exterior styling was spot-on! It looked expensive, and people thought it was an aspirational type car. The paint held up and shined nicely.
3. I paid practically nothing to lease it- 0 out the door, 39k/39 mo, $270/mo
4. Upon return, there were no squeaks, rattles or real wear to the car

Negatives:
1. In the first 600 miles the dual screens became possessed by ghosts. They had to be replaced twice throughout the 3 years I had with the car. There were times when the system would just reboot out of the blue, requiring a restart to get the controls functional again. The car decided if and when the backup camera was going to come on. Both times the car was out of commission for a month, which made me happy because the loaner was always something that WASN'T a Q50
2. The steering felt like it was shot up with Novocain, and this isn't the drive by wire steering either, just the standard rack. 
3. The seats were ""synthetic leather"" aka vinyl, and although high quality, it was no where near the quality of genuine leather. Just a flat ugly matte finish. The rest of the interior had relatively high quality controls, but the chrome trim did start peeling from the window switch which infuriated me.
4. The rear brakes needed replacement at 25k miles! ...Read the other review about the guy who went through the same thing. My story is exactly the same. Found and ind. shop to replace them for $150, so not a huge deal. They were so bad though, they ate through the rotors.
5. Winter safety- This is a big one. The G37x was a stalwart in the snow. It wouldn't budge. The Q50 almost caused several crashes, one in particular driving down a mountain on a road trip to South Dakota, where it spun out 3x doing 360 spins like an Olympic champion! Maybe it was crappy tires from the factory, but the tread depth was still 5/8th when I turned it in, so it wasn't from wear or lack of maintenance. 
6. I can't speak for the Bose system, but if you happen to end up with the Q50a that has a base sound system, be prepared to be blown away by your friend's 97 Cavalier. I had to install a subwoofer because it was so godawful. 
7. It feels like a regression of a formerly great vehicle. 

In the 29k miles I had that car, I rotated the tires every 7k so I wouldn't be stuck with a replacement bill, but only had the oil changed twice. It never left me stranded and I beat on that car every single chance I got. Sometimes, because I hated it so much, I'd just sit and hit the rev limiter while it was cold to warm up quicker. In terms of drivetrain reliability I doubt a well taken care of example will cause much grief. Mine will probably need an engine replacement before 100k. 

All in all, I wouldn't buy one unless I got it for a song. 
"
infiniti,q50,2015,PsyMed, 08/22/2015,Direct Adaptive Steering performs poorly,2,"Edmunds full expert review has nothing good to say about the Direct Adaptive Steering option, and now I know why.  My new, fully loaded Q50 Premium hash Direct Adaptive Steering and run-flat tires.  After driving it over 1000 miles on mostly highways, I'm deeply troubled by the rather abysmal performance, road handling, and maybe even the real-world safety of this steer-by-wire system.  (As of this writing, I do not know the extent to which the rather miserable run-flat tires may be contributing to this poor performance,  but I suspect it may be quite significant. I will have more to say about these tires shortly.) 

 For those who may not be familiar with Infiniti's Direct Adaptive Steering (""steer-by-wire""), there isn't a conventional mechanically coupled linkage between the steering wheel and the front end.  Rather, the system relies on an electronic interface between the  steering wheel and the front end.  Thus, unlike conventional steering, there is no instantaneous telegraphing and biomechanical feedback of the sensations that a driver normally feels between one's hands on the steering wheel and the road, particularly lacking the natural progressive resistance that one would normally feel as the steering wheel is turned ever more to the left or to the right.

  The lack of this natural  sensation between the drivers hands and the road would be totally unnerving and disorienting.  So, Infiniti has attempted to simulate this sensation by driver selectable settings found within the Infiniti Drive Mode Selector app, found by scrolling through the apps on the touch pad.  After tapping the DMS app, one first selects Steering, after which one has four steering modes between ""Effort"" and ""Response"" to choose from, including (1) Light/Casual, (2) Standard/Standard, (3) Standard/Quick, and (4) Heavy/Quick.    Basically, the settings determine the degree of resistance one feels when turning the steering wheel. 

 With DAS, the  vehicle has an unnerving habit of wandering, floating, and swerving or yawing from side-to-side, requiring nearly constant steering corrections.    Unlike conventional steering, when one is negotiating a curve on a highway with DAS,  you can't simply turn the wheel in and hold it there as you progress through the curve.   If you attempt to do so you will quickly find that a few seconds after you turn the wheel slightly, the vehicle will stop going in the direction of the turn and will begin to go straight, so you have to keep turning the wheel back in the direction of the curve.  This in turn results in the vehicle wandering from side to side.
 
But wait, there's more.  With DAS, the vehicle tends to fall into and follow, for example, any uneven seams or other such things in the road surface. In addition, when one is passing, or being passed by trucks (and even other cars) the wind drafts will blow the car to the side and require  diligence with the steering  wheel because one must anticipate and compensate for this.   I cringe to think how it might perform when driving on the freeway with strong gusting winds and slippery road conditions.  On the bright side, my experience thus far has been that DAS  performs decidedly better when driving around town as well as on country roads.  

 Quite frankly, I am utterly baffled as to how this steer-by-wire system ever made it into production.  What in the world were they thinking?  It remains to be seen whether or not there will eventually be a Technical Service Bulletin about this glaring problem,  and if so, whether or not a firmware update will even be possible in order to fix the problem.  While driving on highways with the Driver Assist is on, the vehicle will wander/bounce back and forth within its lane if you let it, rather like a bobsled.   In fact, unless you're very diligent about keeping the vehicle on track, the degree of wandering from side to side has me
 worried that I might get pulled over by the police for driving is if I am intoxicated!  My experience thus far has been that the vehicle wanders the least in the Heavy/Quick setting.

 As previously mentioned, I remain very suspicious that the run-flat tires may be part of the problem, and  I would be very curious to see how it performs when I eventually replace them with a set of Michelin Primacy tires.   The Internet reveals that the majority of consumers don't like run-flats because they impart a rough ride; they cost a third more than conventional tires; and they wear very quickly.   I find it to be absolutely infuriating that the automotive industry is increasingly cramming these tires down our throats.  Indeed,  I have read reports that BMW for example may void the warranty if these tires are replaced with conventionals. Fortunately, with the 2015 Q50, these tires can be replaced with conventional ones without voiding the warranty.  In addition, the vehicle has a spare tire that can be replaced with a conventional one.

infiniti,q50,2015,Charlene, 07/01/2017,What happened to Infiniti,1,"This current lease with Infiniti will be my 17-20th years of driving an Infiniti. This car is an absolute disappointment. I had to get premium just for leather seats. The non leather are very uncomfortable. The steering, braking were changed. Car is all over the place and braking is also more powered. What happened to the stiff steering and braking.  Pick up is not as good. If you take great pleasure in driving as I do, this car is not for you. It is not a driving experience at all. Way too many distractions. Not driver focused. For example, the console is not facing driver. It's difficult to see radio, back up camera. You have to press too many buttons to get what you want. I like to put on radio and see stations not have to press a button to see what I want. I like climate control as well to see it not have to play with buttons to see it. Too many distractions if you live to drive. Can't shut off top screen with navigation. The leather seats are comfortable and good quality, but to pay the high price they charge is it worth it.

infiniti,q50,2015,slcraft, 05/13/2015,Unsung Hero,4,"It really sucks that this car will be overlooked by most due to the ongoing poor reviews for the ""Drive by Wire"" steering that has been universally panned by enthusiast reviews.  It seems every car road tested has all the electronics which, while impressed by them, many reviewers disliked as being too disconnected and not feeling natural.   This is why I did my research and, once I found out I could lease a well equipped Q50 AWD Premium I ran to my dealer to do so.  I put no money down and pay $430 a month.  Options were Navigation (which includes voice activation, Bose System, Infiniti In Touch and Sirius Radio, the 19inch wheels (must have) leather package, and spare tire. NO drive by wire steering, ever!!!  Outfitted like this it is one of the best looking cars in its class and you get a ton of equipment for 10k less than a BMW and the exclusivity that is hard to find.  I have never seen another exactly like mine in my medium sized city.  Reliable, great service, tons of features, fast, smooth, and always a treat to turn around and admire.  Full LED lighting, Bose Studio on Wheels, it even reads my texts!  DONE!

Many comparisons are made to the BMW 3 series, and Merdeces-Benz C class, but the q50 can be purchased for significantly less money. I found that I was able to get a Q50 for less than a Subaru wrx sti and the build quality is far superior. I was able to buy a q50 for 33k (36.8k out the door with tax, and other fees)

The cargo truck is so small, that if you have a bag of groceries, it will squash the items in the bag.  The navigation system usually is inaccurate and shuts down within 1/4 mile of what it perceives to be the destination.   There are NO safety features (for the price of $50,000) one would have expected at least blind spot  warning.   The Honda accord at 10,000 - 15,000 less has more features!!!!

I will write my upfront and honest review about the vehicle after putting it to the test the past 3 days. Please keep in mind I come from a 2010 535i RWD Sport. First impressions the Q50s seems like a top competitor in the sport sedan market , it is anything but. The acceleration isn't anything impressive , the car severely lacks torque and it shows. The cornering in 'AWD' kicks in when needed and is absolutely horrendous. It causes severe understeer  and instability. The ride feels very cheap and unstable as well. The seats aren't great and overall the interior feels cheap. The Bose 14 speaker system could be better as well.  There are other little things like non power steering wheel with out the - Deluxe Pkg.. I am sorry but for a mid 40s sedan to have a manual adjusting steering wheel is sad. If you want a reliable commuter car -Q50s ( I say the term 'S' lightly haha) is for you. If you want a real sport sedan with a solid drive , precise handling and impressive acceleration then the 335i/535i is your vehicle.

This is literally one of the reasons we sold ours. We couldn't fit our luggage in and there are only two of us. On the plus side, its a very sporty looking car and drives like one. Quick throaty response and plenty of giddy-up! My wife like to drive on our country roads in sport mode and went through an expensive set of tires in under 20K. We don't do that any more. We also drove through a vicious snowstorm and the car handled great.  The infotainment system is non-intuitive and makes for dangerous driving while trying to figure it out. It most cases, you need a co-pilot to figure out the infotainment system while moving. Overall we liked the car but just didn't love it.

infiniti,q50,2016,Dan, 01/23/2017,Best car I've driven in this price range.,5,"At first I was skeptical about Infiniti in general. I knew that they had the G-35 series which were popular in the 2 door version. I was not impressed by the 4 door models..too small for my taste. When the Q50 3.7 came out my wife leased one and I started driving it occasionally. She absolutely loves it and I fell in love with the Q50 series as well. When the Q50 turbo came out and I had an opportunity to road test one I actually got it that day! It's perfect 2017 Q50 RS 400 twin turbo all wheel drive! What an amazing car for the price. It's a rocket period! Put it in Sport + and you literally need to hold yourself together because by the time you realize what's going on mostly likely the speedometer is way past 100mph. I have no complaints about the car. It has power, looks sharp, comfortable seating, and it has so many option of driving that it's a ball to drive. Mine only has the navigation option and that's it. If you have 50k burning a hole in your pocket give this car a try, you will not regret it!

infiniti,q50,2016,twin turbo V6 with AWD, 09/29/2016,Catch me if you can,5,"This is my first Infiniti but it won't be my last, perfect blend of sport and comfort! The power of the V6 twin turbo is amazing given the HP rating, so much quicker than other 300 hp cars I have owned. Guessing its due to the turbos offering torque coming on strong at just 1500 rpms. Maybe it's under rated? Anyway, very happy with nearly everything. Given a magic wand I would ask that blind spot monitoring and other the safety items be standard fare. Also it should be real leather! Sticker was 45k but got it down to just 38.5k.

"
infiniti,q50,2016,Thomas Gaydos, 01/27/2017,The Ultimate Sleeper Sedan,5,"The Q50 Red Sport 400 needed to convince me to buy it...and it did. Coming off of a 2013 Infiniti M37xS lease (Q70 S AWD in modern nomenclature), I was looking to downsize. I leased the M37, a very large car, opportunistically because Infiniti had a great lease deal on the loaded models, but the truth is that I liked my G37s much better. The convincing came after driving some tough competition in the form of a BMW 340i and Audi S4, both of which I liked for various reasons. The first car I test drive was actually a Q60 Red Sport coupe loaded up with the DAS steering and all sorts of active safety tech. The interior was red with optic white trim. it was gorgeous. The car fast, composed, and a lot of fun. The steering was good, but still a bit video-gamey for my tastes. I had to deactivate much of the electronic safety wizardry because it drove me nuts. The next car was what I fell in love with; a Q50 Red Sport sedan, black on black, with only the Premium Plus package and a couple other select options added on to the standard Red Sport goodies. The black with the dark gray 19"" rims is a badass look and the black interior with the textured shodo aluminum trim is much more sporty than the wood interior treatment. The best part - besides the bonkers engine - is that the standard steering with electric-assist is MUCH better than the DAS, but still offers a couple of different settings. What won me over was the the combination of how the car drives and that I liked the interior and in-car tech better in the Infiniti. The first impression that you get when driving a Red Sport is that the engine is an absolute monster. I've owned and driven some fast cars and I think 400hp is under-rating this engine. It could be that it feels even faster because the torque comes on so early (1500) with a broad peak (6200) and that the AWD variant I have delivers all of that power at any time, but wow...this thing HAULS! The drive modes (SNOW, ECO, Standard, Sport, Sport+, Personal) significantly alter the personality of the car. SNOW mode is for the deep stuff. It essentially locks the car into 50/50 split and softens torque application, ECO actively resists aggressive driving and is perfect when driving elderly relatives, Standard mode softens the suspension, steering, throttle, and shifts and is perfect for general cruising, Sport makes the suspension stiffer, steering quicker, and everything feel much more aggressive, Sport + mode is hooligan mode and dials back the traction control. Personal mode allows individual settings for Steering, Suspension, Shifts/Throttle (I like everything dialed up expect standard suspension for highway driving, for instance). In all modes not SNOW or ECO, the Red Sport wants to run. I've already logged 4.48s 0-60 run and 12.95 quarter at 109.1mph according to Vbox in my limited testing. The interior is technically impressive with it's 2 touch screens and 3rd color screen between the gauges. Some complain that the InTouch system is difficult to use, but after a short time it becomes second nature. The app connectivity is beyond pathetic (only Facebook Check-in and Events, and Google Online Search apps) and is waaaay behind the competition, and the lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is shocking, the bluetooth and USB connectivity, the easy-to-use navigation system, and the solid design of the overall interface make it a positive experience. The Bose 14 speaker XM/HD Radio/FM/AM system is impressive and is superior to any of the other Bose systems I've experienced in other Infiniti vehicles. It was also the best audio system of the cars I test drove. Overall, the interior is very comfortable with soft leather and high quality switchgear everywhere you touch. This Q50 has the G37 character that I felt the 2014 model lacked. It's aggressive and always wants to attack the next straightaway, curve, or onramp. The engine
 sound is addictive and it'll pin you back in your seat. Check this one out if you want a true performance sleep that also happens to be a heck of a value.

infiniti,q50,2016,Joel, 03/27/2018,23k miles driven - True Review *UPDATED*,2,"**UPDATE SINCE LAST REVIEW  - July 2019. The car had a catastrophic engine failure (31,792 miles). The car has not warned me when there is an engine code, or if there is something wrong with it, which has put me at peril while driving it. The engine failed this past June, and it did not display an engine failure on the dashboard. I'm currently working with Infiniti Consumer Affairs to fix the situation, and I will keep this review updated**. The car shows excellent acceleration from 0MPH. However, when in traffic, decelerating, or at slower speeds, if speeds are demanded, the car will drag horrendously. It simply will sit there and go through the motions before reacting to the demanded power (between the downshifting, and the turbo charging, it is extremely slow to respond). That is probably because it is mostly relying on turbo power when it is in motion or decelerating,  and it is when the turbo lag issue shows up.  MPG is far from the ""estimated"" values advertised. I personally drive about 65% city, 35% highway, and I get an average of 17.3 MPG. Everybody is amazed at the technology offered by this car, I'm like ""meh"". The redundant systems contradict each other, are really unnecessary, and are really buggy. For example, there is no way to set a specific app, or app function, as it will reset each time you start the vehicle. The Infiniti drive mode selection is not harmony with the other drive mode selection that is selected separately. You can set one at ""sports mode"" and the other on can remain on “standard”, and vice versa – no alignment.   Also, these car's depreciation rate is probably one of the worst for Japanese cars. The rear view camera software freezes constantly (I've had the unit replaced twice), the systems resets quite often, sometimes while driving, and the electronic clock shown is probably the brand killer (especially for those who really appreciated good clock workmanship from Infiniti), yes electronic technology the car is loaded with, not a big deal. In fact, I think it destroys the brand. Other than that, it is a smooth, comfortable ride.

infiniti,q50,2016,Raymond Gross, 09/28/2016,My New Q50,4,"I leased a new Q50 when they first came out three years ago.  That car had some issues (most notably the computer), but when my lease was up I decided to give the Q50 another try.  I absolutely love my new Q50.  The computer issues have all been resolved and I don't notice any of the issues I had with my last one.  Even though the engine is a bit smaller, the turbo gives the car plenty of power.  It also handles like a dream.  The sports seats provide great support.  And I love all the technology.  After having two Q50s, I can't imagine owning a car without the surround view cameras.  But best of all, the dealers were bending over backwards to move the cars over Labor Day weekend.  The final cap cost on my new lease was over $10k below sticker (with the only upfront payment on my part being the customary drive offs).  I would highly recommend this car.

infiniti,q50,2016,Javan Pohl, 01/13/2017,Great so far,5,"I came off of owning a 2006 Infiniti g35x.  I, like others, was worried about the acceleration, with this being a turbo driven(?), smaller engine.  While I think perhaps this new one might have a little less grunt if you're already going 40 or 60, off the line, this thing is like a vomit-inducing rocket.  There's a turbo?--I sure can't tell.  Yes, the steering is a bit wonky at first but I think I might grow to like it--as of right now I'm ambivalent about it.  It's like it fights your initial move on the wheel and then slightly keeps it where you move it.  Weird.  I haven't really had a chance to test them out but the brakes don't feel quite as utterly and mind-blowingly amazing as they were on my g35x.  Those things were absolutely ridiculous though.  I don't think I ever put my foot all the way to the floor.  These ones feel a lot more civilized but I think if you do put your foot to the floor that's when they'd really clamp down?  We shall see.  The interior is mostly a work of art--I'm SO glad they changed the colors away from that amber/orange color (gross).  However the dual screens are kinda weird.  I hope there's a way to just turn off the GPS screen (haven't found it yet), 'cause I'd rather not have it on all the time.  I also think it's pretty bizarre that you can't change the default driving mode (I have actually verified this one).  I'd much rather have it start up in Eco and what's the point of having a personalized driving mode if you have to click three times to get to it each time you start up the car?  Also seems strange that they don't have a main mid display mode that shows current MPH (that could be one thing I just haven't found yet, but I've definitely toggled through all the screen options.)  Anyways, those are very minor gripes.  So far this car is a dream... I want to live in it.

infiniti,q50,2016,valmiles@cox.net, 01/31/2017,This car looks great on paper,3,"On paper, this Q50 Sport is a great car, less expensive and more capable than BMW 3-series or Mercedes Benz C-class.  However, handing is awful, worse than any other car I have owned or driven, including SUVs!
Q50 is not new to power steering foes.  2015 has its issues with Direct Adaptive Steering.  2016 has gone to electric assisted power steering on the Sports model with the second generation DAS being an option.  Being well aware of the issue with the first generation DAS, I elected to get base electric power steering.
The car, however, wanders whichever way the road takes it, which is specifically evident at highway speeds.  If you hold the steering wheel perfectly straight, the vehicle starts pulling on one direction, after correcting it, it pulls in the other.  We have seen number of reviews on infinitiq50.org forum about this issue, some owners indicating that Run Flat Tires (RFTs) are causing this behavior.
I don’t know for certain and I’m not willing to replace tires on the brand new vehicle.  In few months I will trade it in and get something else, although at a loss.
Other than this issue and few deficiencies with the infotainment system, such as lack of useful applications and slow response, this car has been good.  Acceleration is excellent, but the poor steering takes all the fun out of driving it.
After driving Nissan vehicles for over 20 years, this Infinity was a major disappointment.  No more Nissan/Infiniti vehicles for me.

Infiniti introduced a 3.0L TT Engine last year and so I made the switch (I lease my cars - the best way to go!) I absolutely love the new engine! The throttle/acceleration response is to the point and almost instant! I drive this car daily back and forth to work and some fun weekend drives and am very happy with it! This time, I added the Driver's Assistance package to give me some safety features and I'm glad I did it. The only thing that I dont like (it has more to do with my personal preference - nothing wrong with the feature itself) is that the forward collision warning and emergency braking assist kicks in when I'm zipping in and out of traffic. I know I can turn this feature off but for the 10-20 seconds of ""fun"" driving, I wouldnt want to keep having to go to the settings to turn the feature of, even though it can be turned off just by turning the Traction OFF. This car is very smooth and it can get up to speed in no time so just in case... I never turn the traction control off. Over all... very happy with the change and upgrade. I'll probably switch to the RedSport next time around and get a feel for it that beast as well!

infiniti,q50,2016,Michael Y, 11/21/2019,Q50 2.0T Garbage,1,"Nice looking car with potentially good features but in reality it is garbage. May be my expectations where high as I owned a Hyundai Azera that I loved and had no issues with it. As for the Q50 2.0T, it had fume smell in the car for the first 4 months until it was fixed. The cooling fan will run on once you shut the car off and will wake my entire neighborhood as it was very loud. The screens will go blank randomly while driving. Plus the passenger and driver window would go down very slowly and make a lot of noise. I think Infiniti has a lot to learn from Hyundai on how to build reliable and consistent cars.

I have black on black and it turns heads.  The reviews are correct:  there is no turbo lag.  The steering is a little different feel, but I'm coming out of 15 yrs of SUV driving.

I am getting used to the DAS system and don't mind at all. The only complaints I have is no Android Auto or Apple Carplay which is ridiculous nowadays and no ventilated seats. This car is flying under the radar and not too many people know about it and I like it. So far no mechanical issues but my mileage is still low. Gas mileage is a crappy 20 mpg, however, I think it's worth the fun.

infiniti,q50,2017,Scott, 02/14/2018,Stupid Fast!,5,"I have almost 10,000 miles on my 2017 Q50 Red Sport so I figured it was about time to write a review.  I have had it for 10 months and driven in snow, rain and dry conditions.  Mountains and flat ground.  The thing has been great in all conditions, even in a mini blizzard!  You have to watch the throttle in bad weather, or use the economy or snow modes but otherwise it handles great.  I find myself going over the limit a bit more often when accelerating on an on-ramp, it just gets to speed so quickly if you aren't paying attention, even faster if you have it in sport or sport+ mode.  I typically drive around in standard mode.  I initially used the economy mode but realized it didn't seem to make a big difference in fuel economy.  Speaking of, I average 22-24 MPG with a good mix of city and highway.  I play with the speed a bit but I'm not racing every car I pull up next to at a stop light either.  I have had it back to the dealer three times.  First was for the Bluetooth system.  It would not connect properly to my old LG G4 even though they advertised it would.  They went through the Bluetooth system and couldn't find anything and finally told me to go away that there wasn't anything they could do for me.  Now with my new (Samsung S8) there haven't been any issues.  Second trip was for the first oil change.  Third trip was due to a notice I got in the mail about a computer re-programming (no big deal).  Otherwise I haven't had any issues.  I was a littler nervous about the run flat tires and no spare.  I got a nail in one of the tires and saw that it was $465/tire for the OEM tires.  Luckily the nail didn't puncture the air chamber and I didn't have to replace the tire.  There are cheaper run flats but I have been impressed with the tires, not sure I want to spend that for replacement tires when that time comes.  Overall for being a fairly large car, it handles well and has a stupid amount of acceleration, even at highway speeds.  I love the flat torque curve.  I was a little worried about having some buyers remorse but so far I have been super happy with the car!

October 2002 Update:  Have around 55,000 miles on the car now.  Nothing has really changed from my initial thoughts.  Few sets of tires (Bridgestone Driveguard seem to work well on it and get good mileage).  Have take a couple trips and driven in a lot of snow/ice with no issues.  It does take a little getting used to the handling in the snow but once you get the feel for it there aren't really any issues.  Still very happy with the purchase.

infiniti,q50,2017,Bob D, 02/02/2017,Rocket ship,5,"Recently turned in a 2014 Q50 AWD 3.7 v6 premium for a 2017 Q50 AWD premium 3.0 twin turbo. I was worried about the power of the 3.0 vs the 3.7. I loved the 3.7 v6 power and top end speed but this twin turbo 3.0 really surprised me. The power and smoothness is great. No turbo lag and the power is felt even at low rpm's. My 2014 had a very slow info system. It took for ever for the app's and radio to boot up. This 2017 must have a new and much faster processor in it because everything comes on in a couple of seconds. Although the two cars look the same, they drive differently. Smoother ride and power response from the 2017. Infiniti added two more speakers for a total of 16 but I don't notice any difference. The sound was great already in the 2014 model. Only disappointment is that the 2014 came standard with heated seats and steering and now you have to get the navigation package to get them. All in all I'm very happy with this 2017!!

infiniti,q50,2017,Q50 live, 03/08/2017,"Q50, Slicing Through the Wind",5,"This is a great car. I've been an owner for about 2 months and I absolutely love the car. Great acceleration, minimal shift shock and dynamic breaking without the dramatic nose dive. When you start the engine it doesn't sound so luxurious, but levels out after the fluids start mixing. Not a problem, but something that you notice. Not much head room unless you lower the seats and a small trunk that's ""about"" the same as its competitors. I love the Infiniti InTouch system and the ability to utilize your cell phone for many out of car features.  There's power in the pedal. You may want to be a little easy when you use the Sport Mode as it will give you what you asked for. Comes with Run Flat tires and no spare just so you know. Still a great car.

"
infiniti,q50,2017,Sash, 06/01/2017,Q50 redsport,4,"I've had the car for about 2 months. My previous car was a G37 IPL, so I will mostly compare this to that and the other two cars I cross shopped this with, the BMW 440iGC/340i and Lexus GS350 F Sport. It's definitely faster than the IPL, but it doesn't feel as sporty. I can't figure out why, but I've narrowed it down to either the tires being different or because the IPL had a LSD. It just doesn't feel that great in the corners. The acceleration is really good, though. I mainly drive on the highway and it's really useful for when you have to speed up to change lanes. From what I've read, the 400HP ranking is actually underrated. But still, I actually preferred the cars I was comparing this too. I really wanted a Lexus GS, but when it came down to price, there was really no decision at all. They have some insane deals going on. The sticker on mine was $57K. The Lexus and BMW I was looking at were $59K. My monthly lease payment is $250-350 lower with the Infiniti. My payment is actually $50 lower than what it was for my IPL and this has a lot more power and technology. The gas mileage is pretty good too. I get 24mpg in Sport mode and 25 in Normal. One time I was running low on gas, so I took it easy on the pedal and I got up to 30mpg. So in conclusion, the car looks great, handles okay, has a lot of power, interior is comfortable with a good amount of space, has all the new technology, and even gets pretty good gas mileage if you don't mash the peddle. And they usually have really good deals going on, so it's great value for the money.

All I can say is wow! this car is a ""sleeper""...I have had so may BMW 335is, Lexus IS350 and Acuras want to race me.  Now I'm not a racer but you put this in sport + or as I've created my own ""personal"" configuration and none of them can keep up, it's not even close. On top of that(I've had it about 2 years now), it's super comfortable for long drives of over 500 miles, it's Bluetooth works great, seat warmers and steering wheel warmers come in very handy, it gives decent gas mileage for the way I drive and over the last year it's become even more intuitive to my driving style .  It's a real pleasure to drive, and I can truly say, it's the best infiniti I've owned by MILES!!!

Coming off lease or a 2015 BMW 428i x drive, the Infiniti has more comfort, better acceleration, and more safety features. Handling is a little less precise, but better ride on long trips more than makes up for it. Once you get used to the Direct Adaptive Steering it is great and adjustable too.

infiniti,q50,2017,Chris, 12/21/2018,Fun ride but pros and cons exist,4,"I love my infiniti Q50 Red Sport. The exterior styling is truly exemplary with many eye catching lines, pronounced wheel arches, sporty looking wheels, and amazing light design. The interior is filled with nice technology and the Bose surround system is amazing. Twin turbo V-6 offers some nice power for the price point. Now for the cons... The fuel efficiency is poor. Even at this power level you'd expect 3-4 more miles and the sticker overstates it. Second, the rear view camera has a very dim light. It really needs to be improved. Even though the top camera and side cameras are a nice add on, still it leaves you wanting a little bit more. Transmission shifts a bit harsh and it is not THE most comfortable, but you probably expect that getting a sports car. Overall the car is a great value and a great design. CPO warranty is strong as well. Full disclosure, I sell a competitor for a living in the high luxury segment. If you wanted to get a bit more out of a similar car, look to spend 65-75k instead of the 50's this Red Sport is in.

infiniti,q50,2017,srd555, 01/20/2018,Beware!!!,2,"Bought a new 2018 Red sport. Two days after purchase the lower touch screen malfunctions. Took it back to the dealer and was told I NEED A new DCU (the lower screen). I was told it would take 5 days. On the 8th day I had to call to find out whats going on and was told the part is on back order for a month. As of today the month has come and gone and still no car and no idea when I would get it back. Inifiniti customer care has to be the worst in history. I have been lied to and my calls have gone unanswered. They tell me dates, then when the date passes I have to call and then im told another date with no explanation as to why the change. Ive searched the internet and found that the DCU is an on going issue for infiniti since 2014 so they know about it, but when I originally asked if this is something that happens alot, I was told no. This has been my worst purchase ever. The look , power and handling of the car is fantastic but the unreliability of the electronics and the terrible customer service makes this a bad buy. I gave up a reliable Lexus I had for 11 years for this car and it broke in 2 days. This is my first and last Infiniti. After I get it back i need to find a way to get out of it before anything else happens""

infiniti,q50,2017,BobL, 10/28/2017,"Based on specs, this is a great car, but...",3,"It looks impressive in specs.  Engine is excellent, it makes me doubt that it only has 300HP, feels more potent, perhaps the high torque at low RPMs is a big help.  The major issue with this car is that Infiniti completely screwed up steering and to add insult to injury installed awful run flat tires (2.5 starts on TireRack).  I changed the tires at 6K miles, first time in my life before tires wore out.  The steering does not seem to have a center, the car goes left and right whenever it feels like on the highway, even if the steering wheel is not moving.  In-spite of the engine and good interior, not a bad looking exterior, I'm not enjoying driving this car.  Will be trading it in when Genesis G70 becomes available.  No more Infinities for me.

infiniti,q50,2017,Susan, 12/28/2017,Not Fully Satisfied,3,"If you live in a snowy climate, be prepared to have the front and back sensors go off the entire time you are driving because the snow builds up on it. When I called to ask about it, I was told I could either turn the sensors off manually, (and lose the safety feature) or keep getting out of my car to wipe them off. That’s not an option as I drive mainly on highways and will not pull off on an interstate highway and risk getting hit.     Not acceptable for the cost of this car.                                                                   I also put in an after market remote starter which will not work as I was told by the dealer, after I put it in, that the heater, etc will reset to automatic and there’s nothing I can do about it. That should have been told to me when I told the dealer I was putting a remote starter in since they said they couldn’t do it after market at the dealership.                              The other thing I am struggling with is I do not hear my email tones on my phone or thru the car.  I’ve called a number of times and the blue tooth department tells me it’s an in touch problem, and in touch says it’s blue tooth department.  Meanwhile, I know it works because I’ve heard it a couple times, but it’s not consistent.  So frustrating.

I wanted to keep my expenses within a reasonable range, and hence eliminated the German cars from my search.  From the Japanese luxury sedans, the Infiniti was more fun to drive and engaging. Infiniti then gave me a good deal, which settled the matter for me. There is a lot of chatter about the dual screen and jnfotainment system, but I found it easy to use.

I love the styling, handling, and performance.  The Bose audio system is outstanding.  The infotainment system is old (no Carplay or Android Auto) but works well.  I especially appreciate that it indexes my iPod & thumb drive so that I can say ""Play song <name>"" or ""Play artist <name>"" and it works.  The Kia Stinger could not do that and the Audi A4 wouldn't work with my iPod at all!  What keeps me coming back to Infiniti is quality.  This is the sixth G35/G37/Q50 I've leased and I've never had a single major issue with any of them.  So why only 4 stars?  The seats.  The seat bottom feels like it is designed for a tiny Japanese person -- which I'm not.  The sides of the seat bottom are stiff and cupped upward, to keep you from sliding around during all those high-G turns Infiniti expects you to make, but for me they press into my butt enough to cause soreness and fatigue - so much so that I had to buy a foam seat cushion to use on long trips or I end up with sciatic pain.  This is something I did not notice during my 20 minute test drive, but after a week of owning the car it became evident.  If I could take the car back and switch it for a non-sport model, I would - that's how painful it is.

My wife came home in her new Q50 Sport and I was a little sceptical. 20k miles later and now I cant wait to move her into the coupe version (Q60). Fun to drive, the twin turbos present incredible power. Handling is superb even over 100mph. I will agree the road noise is a bit high but keep in mind it is a sport sedan. The split screen system does take a little getting use to but works fine for us. Gas mileage averages about 24-25mpg even at 90mph, 300 mile road trips. Comfort for us is great even on long trips (I'm 6'1""). The trunk has plenty of space. The maintenance is relatively affordable even through the dealer. The ONLY 2 issues we have are 1) no heated seats 2) no memory settings on the driver seat. Not really a problem on either one considering I only drive the car on road trips and living in South Texas limits the real use of the heated seats. Being a long time Mercedes fan I must admit....My wife really knocked it out of the park with this choice of vehicle. Infinity....I love the performance of this vehicle!! Would I change over from my passion for Mercedes probably not. Would I recomend this car ""YES"". Oh regarding fuel..YES you have to run Premium fuel. This is due to the twin turbos and the need for higher octane levels. Realistically what is an extra $2 at the pump. I hope this helps, I personally think you will NOT be disappointed with this purchase.

The vehicle looks nice on the outside and the dimensions give an impression of large interior size.    However the vehicle is small on the inside.  Especially the back seat leg room.  The worst part is the road noise intruding into the vehicle on rough roads.  The Ford Fusion and Hyundai Sonata are quieter on the inside and can be bought for thousands less.  I'd skip this vehicle.  However if your heart is set on this vehicle then make sure to test drive the car on a rough road.

infiniti,q50,2018,Tom K, 11/13/2017,Q50 after 1 year,3,"The bumper color on my new 2018, Liquid Platinum, Q50 is noticeably different then the rest of the vehicle.  Make certain to look at the car in sunlight or at night under the lights before making your decision.  This issue definitely is the reason for for my review. I have pictures if required. 
FYI, the salesman said that Premium fuel is suggested but you can use regular but the owners manual says that Premium fueling iS REQUIRED. And regular can be used only in an emergency.

infiniti,q50,2019,Scott, 12/19/2018,Great driving beast,5,"Ok, time to update this review. My opinions have not changed. This is a great car. Currently I have a little over 32,000 miles on the car and have not had a single mechanical or electrical issue of any kind. The only work I’ve had done are oil changes. I agree with the criticism of the runflat tires. Before I even had 1000 miles on the vehicle I picked up a nail in one of the runflat tires and nobody would repair it because of the way the runflat tires are made. I had to pay over $500For one single new tire. So, I replaced the runflat tires with speed rated tires of the same size that are just conventional tires and I have a AAA membership. The spare tire issue, or lack there of, because the car comes with runflat tires is my biggest criticism of the car. Otherwise, the acceleration is great, the sound system is wonderful, the brakes are still working terrific, and the vehicle looks wonderful. Overall-great car.

infiniti,q50,2019,Chris Dennis, 12/28/2018,Big upgrade over my old 2008 G35,5,"Thrilled with most aspects. I’ll only list the negatives since there are so many positives and most are already published:
Should have option to switch out the run flat tires.  They get reduced tread lift and add some road noise. 
Dual infotainment is ok...would prefer more custom configuration
Road noise is moderate above 70 mph but still much improved over my older 2008. 
No Apple car play. Dealer said their internal InTouch is better.  I disagree. 

Otherwise love the look and feel of this car and totally enjoy driving it. I suddenly don’t mind running errands for the wife.  "
infiniti,q50,2019,Brent , 05/22/2019,Absolutely love this car. Good and Bad review.,5,"The good then the bad....
The good to start ok?
1.  Awesome looks. The styling on this car is sexy as hell. The black paint is like a mirror. The rims and tires are very appealing and performance oriented. 
.2. Safety features are here. I like the all way around the vehicle back up cameras and the collision avoidance so I don't rear end anyone. There is a button to push where the sunroof controller is in case of a crash, it will connect you with a live INFINITI operator.
3. The black interior is so well done with real leather all over. The sunroof really makes it more fun. I am 6ft 1 inch and 280 pounds...4 guys like me can easily drive all day in this car. The 14 speaker Bose system is so clear and powerful. I am very proud to be booming this system.
4. The sound the turbo makes is fun and exhilarating. Plenty of power 300 hp. I have taken the car up to 140, that seems to be about it for top speed. That was fun.
5. Handling...you can drive this car fast around a corner and it will control your braking and gas to make the smoothest turn. The brakes are super strong, and very impressive. 
6. The trunk is huge...I think I could fit a small elephant in there. 

The bad...
1. I am not digging the navigation system, for me it's too complicated to use.
2. It doesn't have apple play or android play or whatever its called. I end up using my phone for directions and playing music via Bluetooth. It would be much easier to touch a screen to go to panora, amazon music or apple music. 
3. The transmission switch for ice, economy, standard, sport and sport plus....it doesn't remember your choice when you restart the car. So everytime i get in the car i have to select economy.....i hate that. 
4. i notice Bluetooth connection issues. it has issues the first minute of start up. 

So to finish....I love this damn car and will buy another when the lease runs out.
5. Some of the instrument panel you cant read unless you like really lean over and look around the steering wheel. i didn't know how to find the cruise control for a few months.

infiniti,q50,2019,Waseeq, 07/19/2019,DeJa Vu all over again?,4,"I lease my cars so I've had 3 Q50 sedans; 1st was the Q50 3.7L and now I'm in my 2nd Q50 3.0t Sedan. I really enjoyed the switch from the 3.7L to the 3.0t. I've never had a turbo engine so it was a pleasant surprise. The power and engine response on the 2016 model was very good. The safety features and technology was great. The 2019 model on the other hand wasnt as smooth of a transition. I currently have about 1200 miles on it (it might change and get better after the break in period) but I feel there is more turbo lag in this car compared to the 2016 model. It's not as responsive. I love the small changes to the exterior body but another thing that I dont like is the brightness of the blind spot warning light.
There seems to be two stages for the light, one is when the BS detects a vehicle and lights up and the second is when it starts blinking when/if you put the turn signal on. The warning light is dimmer than the blinking light. In the older models it was all the same which I prefer. 
Last but not least, the front passenger seat still vibrates. In my 2016 model they couldnt figure out the issue to fix. I lived with it hoping the 2019 model wouldnt have the same issue but I was wrong. 
It's the small things that can ruin a nice car!
"
infiniti,q50,2019,Max, 09/24/2019,Infiniti got cheap with the options,2,"Same great engine but Infiniti reprogrammed the transmission to shift into higher gears at slower speeds. The results are being in 5th gear at 30 MPH. I am sure this was in an attempt to maximize fuel economy but the result is lugging this great power plant to a pedestrian level. Tranny is also harsh on downshifts from 5th to 4th and 4th to 3rd. Options that were on my 2016 not offered in similar packages in 2019. No power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, no more Bose audio, no more memory driver's seat. Better back up camera in 2019 than 2016. More detailed Nav screen. Same two screen set up. Still fun on the open road but in town driving can be maddening with the reprogrammed transmission.

infiniti,q50,2019,Ron Heyl, 01/25/2019,Red Sport 400,5,"This cars acceleration is awesome. I thought the stock exhaust was too quiet for a car with sporting intentions, so I bought the after market Inifini straight pipe axle back exhaust. It is loud but I enjoy the rumble. It’s a lot of fun to drive and I find myself flooring the accelerator as often as conditions permit!
"
infiniti,q50,2019,mudbone , 08/23/2019,"BMW what, Audi who",5,"The RedSport is a bit of both. It's a gentleman's M3.  It's just as explosive as an M3 but without the feeling of constant adrenaline.  It's not as refined as Audi s4, but it's more comfortable that both of the aforementioned.  I've had over 30 BMW's and when I test drove one after driving the Redsport, the Bimmer felt stiff and uncomfortable.  The wind noise and other lack of subtleties may be a problem for some - especially at the price.  Speaking of price, the Redsport is a much better value and Infiniti presents a more reasonable repair option.  I like it much better than BMW.  M3 is more of a drivers car, but Redsport is more of a complete car.  Its a more comfortable driving experience 100% of the time
"
infiniti,q50,2019,Billy, 05/12/2019,Comfortable luxury sedan with loads of power,5,"The Q50 Red Sport is very fun to drive. The 3.0 L twin turbo engine is the highlight. The 7 speed automatic transmission does its job well. Shifts are very smooth and quick. Infotainment system is not the best but is simple and user friendly. The car is a looker, I got mines in iridium blue. The akibono red brake calipers with the gunmetal 19 inch infinity wheels comes standard with the red sport and makes the cars appeal pop. This is my daily driver and I am loving it!

infiniti,q50,2019,Mel, 08/01/2019,Q50 your Amazing!,5,"I was amazed and fell in love with the car right after I test drove it. I've had turbo charged cars before and this car definitely is on top of the game with it's twin turbo charge engine.  I can already tell that this engine is bullet proof. I would definitely buy this car again. Waiting for the 400Z to come out, apparently it's suppose to have the same engine. Go Q50!
"
infiniti,q50,2019,Phil M., 04/10/2020,Solid car but misses on a couple areas,4,"Infiniti cars have a solid build quality with strong performance engines. My car is the Q50 Signature Edition. Comes with nicer black chrome wheels and sport seats. Interior is a relatively clean design with the exception of the center stack. Having two screens is not a problem - the problem is the two screens are two different finishes and one is touch screen and the other isn’t. Also, I bought the last year they didn’t include Apple Car play (started in 2020 models) so that is very limiting when using the underwhelming infotainment system with my phone.

The drive train is strong but a mixed bag. The engine is superior. Good power, smooth acceleration, and reasonably efficient. As you will probably read elsewhere, the 7-speed transmission is a let down. Up shifts are not very smooth and down shifts are clumsy when not shifting yourself. Having driven BMWs for years, I don’t know why almost every automaker is not using the ZF 8-speed transmission. It is so much further ahead of the tranny in the Q50. Nissan/Infiniti needs to figure out their transmission execution. I know they love CVTs and are committed to that, but their torque converter trannys are  a little disappointing.

Suspension is good. My car has the Active Trace feature which is basically a poor mans torque vectoring (brakes the inside rear wheel to pull you through a corner). It actually works very well and causes this car to corner with confidence.

Compared to any German counterparts, it is a great value. The lease deals on these are great! However compared to some of the other brands pushing up market like Kia and Mazda, the value proposition isn’t as strong as it once was 4-5 years ago.

I would cross-shop this car with a Kia Stinger, Mazda 6, Volvo S60 or even a Nissan Maxima. Would I buy this car again? If the infotainment was upgraded and the transmission was different, I definitely would. Strong predicted reliability and a top notch service experience give you a piece of mind that few other cars can give you.

I have no regrets for the purchase I made.

infiniti,q50,2019,Rob H, 01/15/2020,You'll love it!,5,"Over the years, I've owned an Infiniti G35 and a 2014 Q50 before trading in for my 2019 Q50 Red Sport 400. In summary, you can get a faster car in this category from the German companies. You can also get a nicer interior from the German guys. What you can't get from them is this bang-for-the-buck. Dollar for dollar, you would be hard pressed to find a car that can compete with the Red Sport 400. The interior is getting a little outdated but outside of that I absolutely love it! Fantastic, stealthy, daily-driver that can match the straight-line performance of most sport cars...yet with surprising good mpg. 0 -60 mph in 4.5 seconds!? Make sure the baby-seat is strapped down tight! The other guys can keep their German cars. I'll keep the extra @ $20k in my bank account!

infiniti,q50,2019,Hafley, 03/24/2020,Death trap,1,"I took my car in the first month because of it drifting to the right constantly and was told its roadcrown but nothing ever inspected. roadcrown is in the right lanes not every lane. the 4th month the run flat on front right blew out on the sidewall but was no potholes around and roadside assistance never came to tow my car. I had to buy 4 new tires. The 14th month new tire on front right has sidewall damage again with a crack on the inner lip of the rim. Rim was replaced but nothing else inspected. Potholes will throw a car way out of alignment. i went to pay for alignment and only spec out was the left front toe. Now in spec car drifts to the right even more. So if you want a self driving car lol that will go from the left lane to the far right lane in 2 to 3 seconds all by its self i guess its for you. If you want a car that will be a constant money pit,  unsafe snd warranty not covering this car is for you. The manufacturer claims this car is manufactured to constantly drift to the right but i csnt find this complaint anywhere. That seems to be the stupidest thing i ever heard and seems very unsafe. However the company has never drove the car to make this conclusion. cars are put at spec to fight roadcrown. ive never owned a car that seems to drive so unsafe. The lower control arm bushings are defective and leaking and this is whats causing this issue. These defects are not warrantable and cost me 3600.00 to fix the issue. The fuel rails are also defective and leaking gas. I have 25k miles and have replaced my tires 3 times now

infiniti,q50,2019,F Korn, 06/26/2020,Wonderful Infiniti Q50,5,"This is a perfect car. Its fuel consumption is ridiculously low for its size. The inside is very quiet, teh engine sound is a wonderful V6! Extremely good to drive. Beautiful shape. At the gas station people ask what it is, because it is so well-shaped. The Bose hifi is excellent. The seats are very comfortable. The various driver assistance functions work smoothly. When you liearn it to use, the cameras give real help in parking and driving backwards. The car is very fast, runs smoothly. I have the sport tech version, fully extrad. Luggage spece can be best used if you put in big bags, rather than suitcases. The fule consumprion in town is a joke: if you learn how to use the electric motor. I am not sure the finicky reviews are rightt. Except a few functions in infotainment (say, phone mirroring), the car has all the functions imaginable at the end of 2018. The car is built very well, everything matches well, no cracking or other noises inside. Insurance is reasonably priced. In town my fuel consumprion is similar to or less than in my diesel Honda Accord, 2.2, 180 bhp. The Honda Accord was also made in Japan, but you, no doubt, feel the difference. For this price, you can get nothing similar. A shame people do not know more about this car.

infiniti,q50,2019,G_R, 06/27/2020,Awesome!,5,"I was really on the fence for this car based on the negative reviews for the DAS. I am coming from a G37S sedan which I have driven for the last 6 years and absolutely love. After taking the plunge, I have to say this car is a Beast! I now have 3400 miles and truly love everything about the car(minus the Dunlop runflats). Hoping the reliability matches the G37S. Sport+ is a BLAST!"
infiniti,q50,2019,Ahmadski Ha-Hanif, 12/18/2020,Room to improve,4,"For the longest time, my wife and I have been fascinated by INFINITI vehicles, to own the I series, G series (sedans and coupes), multiple Q50S and QX60 SUV's, I still think the INFINITI Q50S 3.0t AWD Sport Sedan (regular sport) is the best car for your money. Yes it might lack some ""futuristic"" interior trimming or exterior design but does it get the job done? Is it still satisfying? OF COURSE IT IS! Let's face it, what's not ""out dated"" now a days. As soon as you buy an electronic or a car for that matter, the next year there is something new about it.  Not that this is a Porsche 911 or anything but performance is on par! So when driving this car, you mainly focus on the drive and handling... not some fancy interior lighting that can change to 20 different colors. Exterior design is very inspiring - from the front headlights to the taillights. My model doesnt have a carplay but it really doesnt matter because we never use it in my wife's car (2021 Subaru Ascent - review coming up soon) anyway. This is my 3rd Q50S Sport sedan and overall... I'm a happy camper, but of course there are some things that I dont like about my Q50S Sedan!
The run-flat tires are nice for what it's meant to do (increase trunk cargo space) but not so much for the ride quality. Early morning/first drive for the first 10 mins or so, it sounds like I have a flat but once it warms up, the sound goes away. Not that I've taken it to the tracks or anything but the couple times I've pushed it on the ramps, you can definitely feel the loss of traction or notice that you have a set of run-flat tires on. It feels like the car is literally riding on the steel sidewalls and heaven forbid you hit a pothole or a small curb. Just the thought of it is scary! But I will say that they are pretty strong. Many times I've hit potholes so hard to have surly blown the tires or damaged the sidewall etc, but nothing came on the odometer display and didnt notice any damage on the tire/wheel either. 
Conclusion... I'd definitely get another one even if they dont change the body style, which I'm hopeful that they will in another 2 years! No other car can come close to the features, technology, performance and not to mention the price of this car!

infiniti,q50,2020,Cincy_Bronx Ride, 08/09/2020,Excellent Value,5,"This is my 2nd Q, I had the 2017 Q50 which was a nice car.  The technology was surely lacking behind Lexus and Acura but the car itself outperformed each of them easily.  I also had a 3 Series BMW, which was a superior ride versus all entry level luxury cars, BUT way too overpriced, pus a weak engine compared to the Q50. I just went to the 2020 Q50S which is Fantastic.  The technology was upgraded, still not the best, but the response is quick and accurate. The 16 speaker Bose is astounding. Lexus always wins on interior detail, they are #1. Acura is too conservative and reminds me too much of a Honda.  I never had good luck with Honda transmissions. Although I had a 1992 Acura Legend which rates as one of my best overall cars I ever owned. You can't go wrong with a Q50 if you want a great engine, smooth transmission, a great drive and an overall comfortable ride. Like I said, Lexus beats Infiniti with interior details and beauty every time, it's not even close. So it all depends on what you are looking for. You can't go wrong with a Q50, or the Q50S if you want a high performance, good looking ride.

infiniti,q60,2017,JRJC, 09/18/2018,Dreams come true,5,"Live in Minneapolis need a AWD vehicle and want one that is sporty and fun to drive.  Ruled out the Camaro (though car of choice, no AWD), Mustang, Challenger (impressive but simply way too much car for me though AWD.  It is the true muscle car).  Narrowed search to Audi A5, BMW & the Infiniti Q60.  Opted for the Q60 based on repair concerns.  BMW & Audi are way to proprietary and need attention of the dealership alone, Q60 comes with all the perks but without the mechanical intricacies of the Audi & BMW allowing my local mechanic to do maintenance as needed.  Plus the price is much more competitive."
infiniti,q60,2017,Jon Michaels, 03/18/2017,A wonderful GT car with a dual personality,4,"I am a month in to owning the Q60S Red Sport 400.  I have owned BMWs (740i, 540i & M5) & Audis (S4 Cabrio and S5 Coupe) in the past as comparison. The exterior appearance is stunning. Like truly breathtaking. I find myself walking backwards away from the car so I can look at it more. The interior design is very well done. The front seats are magic. Just outstanding from a comfort & lateral stability standpoint. Engine performance can be described as a giggle machine with a start button. Just mash the throttle and laugh. The 400bhp & 350ft/lb of torque are available from 2500 RPMs all the way to redline. My favorite move is when I am on the open freeway & impatiently slogging along behind some snow bird doing 55 in a 65 zone. I lightly tug the downshift paddle twice to take me to 5th gear and bury the boot. Good lord, the acceleration is instant and fantastic! Within a few seconds I am doing 100MPH and rushing quickly towards 120MPH if I'm not careful. I've had the car up to 125MPH so far and the stability & smoothness inspires a ton of confidence. The car just seems to sit down on its haunches the faster you go. I set the ""Personal"" mode on the Infiniti Drive Mode to ""Sport+"" engine with ""Standard"" steering and suspension.  This gives me the truest GT experience with instant throttle response & a nice, soft, cushy ride. If I know I will be on the twisties, I'll choose ""Sport+"" mode across the board. The Bose sound system is hands-down the best sounding system I've heard in any car. I know, I know. No highs, no lows, it's gotta be a Bose. That may have been true five years ago, but this system, in this particular car is brilliant. So perfectly clean, with large bass response (no annoying rattle) and crisp highs that just sing. Maybe the Mark Levinson system in the Lexus LS600H is better, but then you're paying $120k for a sedan, so... Handling is so good to the point where it's annoying. I cannot seem to get the car to oversteer or understeer. It just corners with complete neutrality. If I turn off the dynamic anti-skid nannies I could probably get the car to slide some, but I am reticent to do that until I have a better feel for the 16lb/ft of turbo boost coming from the twin chargers. You don't want to get into a slide and have your turbos kick in before the apex! Braking is strong and linear. I adapted to the brakes the first day, which is a testament to how well -- and predictably -- they stop. The car comes with so much safety technology, you almost have to be an imbecile to get into a wreck. I'm sure I can personally figure out a way, as I lean towards the imbecilic, but truly, any normal person is safer in this car than in Fort Knox. Ok, now for the less than stellar. First, the steering. The DAS steering is as vague as everyone says it is. It's really designed and set up for long trips where comfort and low-fatigue are more important than feeling connected to the car. I wish there was a way to turn it off. Shift response is inconsistent. Downshifts under light acceleration come when they feel like it. Downshifts under hard acceleration come fairly quickly, but if you've ever driven a Porsche with the PDK dual clutch, the Q60 Red Sport ain't even in the same universe. Again, you're paying less than half the price, so... Still, for $62k, you'd think a less awesome dual clutch auto-trans would be mated to this terrific engine. As lovely as the interior is, I have a few nits. There are some very specific areas where the materials chosen are just plain cheap AF. The lower part of the interior door assembly for example. Cheap plastic. The inside of the glove box, center console storage and cigarette lighter opening... The cheapest felt-like substance known to man. Like those 1970s glow-in-the-dark posters with the black fuzzy crap? Yeah, that stuff (they still make that shizz?). The rocker switch for the aforementioned Infiniti
 Drive Mode, and the Audi-like circular mouse control are made of hollow chromed plastic that don't feel stout when you're pulling, pushing or twisting them. Guys, really? Use real aluminum for these things for goodness sakes! We have seat heat and steering wheel heat, but we do not have seat ventilation/cooling. This is a big deal to me because I live in Phoenix, AZ. I almost didn't buy the car because of this. Infiniti offers seat ventilation on many of their other models -- as do Honda, Toyota, Ford, Chevy, Opel, Kia and Hyundai. I love these seats, but I won't have a sexual relationship with them until they have ventilation. Lastly, the exhaust note. There really isn't one. When you first start the car, there is slight growl that seems promising but once the engine speed dies down to idle, the car is almost as quiet as a Tesla. If you put the car in ""Sport+"" mode, Infiniti figured out a way to pump some exhaust noise into the cabin to remind you that you have hair on your chest, but it's just not aggressive or loud enough. I'm sitting on 400HP baby! Remind me!

infiniti,q60,2017,Dan, 11/19/2017,"Comparison: 3.7 VQ, 3.0tt, 3.0tt Red Sport",4,"This review is for the Red Sport AWD Q60.  I test drove the 300 hp version (for a week) and I decided to buy the 400 hp version.  The 300 hp VR feels similar to the 3.7 VQ engine in overall power (I had a 2014 Q50); with more low end torque on the VR that runs out of juice at around 4.5K, while the naturally aspirated VQ is still going strong to 6.5K.   The VR will be quicker off the line, and will feel faster when driving around town.   The Red Sport version, on the other hand, is an entirely different animal.  Much quicker from stop and awesome when needing to quickly merge with oncoming traffic on highway ramps in Chicagoland.  There is a slight turbo lag right off the line and the transmission can be slightly sluggish when shifting in lower gears.  Using the paddle shifters make this issue much worse, so I'd just keep the car in automatic and in Sport + mode for the quickest shifting.  The only way that you even notice any of this is because the VR engine in the Red Sport is so much quicker off the line than the older VQ engine; which had the same 7 speed auto transmission.   I would make three suggestions with regards to choosing options for the Q60.  First, you'll want blind spot monitors and driver assistance features; as it is saved me MANY times from changing lanes into a car that was riding behind me in my blind spot.  The Q50's visibility was fine without this feature, but the more sexy Q60 profile has one major limitation; massive rear quarter blind spots.  Also, the around view monitor allows you to park this car effortlessly, without curbing your wheels.  Second, if you enjoy performance oriented driving, I'd skip the Direct Adaptive Steering.  Version 2.0 is better, but it still needs further refinement.  The standard electric steering is quite good; much better than the older VQs hydraulic rack.  Most reviews of this car that complain about the Q60s steering have a fully loaded Q60; with the DAS option.  What a shame, as the standard rack is excellent.  The only trade off is that you do loose some additional features that are packaged with DAS (adaptive cruse control, lane keeping, etc.).  However, Infiniti still gives you 2 settings for the electric steering; standard and sport, which is great and fine for most people.  Third, please consider changing out those horrible run flat OEM tires!  The handling, ride quality, steering, and braking all improve significantly.  A tire change completely transforms this car.  You have no idea how well this car can perform with better tires.  The Run Flats on the Red Sport can kick the back end out of the car when you take a sharp turn and it will hydroplane in heavy rain.  I wouldn't even attempt to use these in the snow.  Cornering also feels unstable with stock tires and the steering is way too heavy.  Did I mention that the ride is brutal with the Run Flats, even in the ""comfort"" mode?  Before I changed the tires, I considered returning the Q60 due to the very harsh ride quality.  This would have been a huge mistake!  As with the DAS optioned on almost all test cars, all reviews that I've read that complain about both the handling and the ride quality... are also using the OEM Run Flats.  (Continental DWS 06s go very well with this model).  Also, I must say that I am happy the the gas millage.  I average 23 mpg with mixed highway / city driving.  I got 21 mpg with the 3.7 VQ.  Mileage actually improved with the addition of 72 hp!  Thanks twin turbos and better cooling.  Lastly, if you shop around you can get some really great deals on this car.  (A well-optioned Q60 Red Sport AWD can be had for the mid-50Ks).  Cross shopping, I felt that I would probably need to jump to around 80k+ to improve on this car's performance.  Even then, you may not be able to match the Q60's good looks.  Yes, I'm looking at you Lexus LC!   Oh, one last comment, the sport seats in the Q60 are
 amazingly comfortable compared to my older Q50s, and even the current Q50s, seats.  No back problems at all on a 750 mile one-day drive!

That is incomprehensible for a luxury brand? I know it is coming for the 2021 models, but undescribable how you can possibly miss that.

infiniti,q60,2017,Andy Matheson, 11/26/2016,"Sleek, sexy, and seductive",5,"First of all, this is our fourth Infiniti. My wife and I like the brand a lot. We had two EX35's (too long in the tooth now despite some recent upgrades), and a Q50 sedan (one of the first). The sedan suffered from excessive wind noise from around both front doors....very irksome on the  Interstate after a while. Apparently many Q50's suffered a similar problem (the Q60 suffers a bit but I can live with it). Apart from that the Q50 was an excellent car with great performance. Lease was almost up and Infiniti offered to make the last three payments for us if we got another car. What I like about Infiniti (and Lexus also) is that their designs are so good that they don't need to keep changing them. The previous coupe was around for a long time so if you keep the Q60 for 6 years you still have a current design. We leased again. My wife is a realtor and wants to look professional when she turns up for appointments. My opinion of the design of the new Q60 coupe....gorgeous; the only way to describe it and better in the flesh than in the photos (where it still looks darned good). The proportions are perfect, the stance just right, the alloy wheels....stunning. We have the pearlescent (Majestic) white which looks just awesome. Definitely better in a light color because of the beautiful dark allows which pop against the white paintwork. Perfection on wheels. I was concerned about poor vision and blind spots in the coupe but actually it is not an issue at all. The car is a joy to drive with the 300hp engine. It sits purposefully lower than the sedan and rides on 19in wheels so it is a little firm but the steering is excellent (the Q50 was a little lifeless and vague) and the car is plenty responsive. Minimal turbo lag. Too early to comment on gas mileage but I don't expect much of an improvement over the sedan. Most of our journeys are fairly short so that will do us no favors. At the end of the day, the 3 year old Q50 sedan only had 19000 miles so we will not be high mileage drivers even when my Mazda lease is up and we don't replace it to become a one car household. I work from home exclusively now so a second car is not required. Anyway, we love this Q60. Any car that brings a smile to my face is going to be good. That doesn't happen too often. My Audi S3 in England had the same effect. So, anyone in the market for a hot-looking coupe with more than enough power and refinement, get a Q60. You won't regret it...totally beautiful car.

infiniti,q60,2017,Cindy Gross, 11/21/2018,"Gorgeous car, but some poor design choices",4,"It's a gorgeous car! It drives like a dream on side roads or smooth highways. It's super comfortable to drive and the safety features are awesome. I can't imagine ever again owning a car without the around-view camera - it makes parking, merging in slow traffic, and squeezing into tight areas SO easy. However, the tires track too much to imperfections on the highway, pulling the car around the lane in construction zones or in the rain. The instrumentation and control panel are unnecessarily complicated. It takes too much attention away from driving to use the navigation and respond to texts (3 clicks and then only a predetermined list of responses you scroll through with more clicks). The location of the center buttons and seat belt holder behind the seat are clearly designed for a tall person. The trunk is tiny and awkward - on a recent road trip we squeezed two suitcases into the trunk and put our backpacks and groceries in the back seats which was inconvenient.

infiniti,q60,2017,Phillip H, 10/27/2018,problems with the infotainment system,3,"I've owned 4 Infiniti coupe's, starting with the g35 and I have liked all of them, but after the g35 the quality of the interior has always been disappointing.   My current 2017 q60 3.0t has had issues with the infotainment system since I first drove it off the lot.  Had it in to the dealership 2 times over the past 2-years, they can't figure it out and blame my iPhone.  but I have had 2 different iPhones over this 2-year period and I've tried 5 different cables and the system reboots even when the iPhone is not attached, but they still blame the iPhone.     What I have finally learned is Infiniti is really nice but not worth the price, I will never buy a new one again, I will consider certified used Infiniti's (  the problems with the infotainment system are that it randomly reboots, sometimes after just a few minutes but mostly after an hour+ of driving.  )
"
infiniti,q60,2017,Driver8, 11/06/2019,Don't be fooled...,2,"I'm literally counting down the days until I turn in this disappointing vehicle.   Infiniti has much to learn if it wants to win in the near-luxury field.  Yes - the 400 hp is great, it handles ok and brakes fine.  The details are sorely lacking and I realize that I've been duped into an overpriced Nissan every single day.   Might sound like I'm being hypercritical, but I didn't have one of these issues in my prior BMWs:  Poor trunk design allows water to dump directly into the trunk onto what ever you're carrying, and there's no way to avoid it other than to clear the top of the trunk prior to opening.   Even the slightest angle.  No drain.  Two dealers have told me it can't be fixed and is a 'design flaw'.  Seatbelt is slightly adjustable at the top base, yet the slightest movement clicks it forward, cutting into my neck.   I readjust it - and it snaps right back.  I'm 5'8"" & average weight and have tried moving the seat up, etc.  If I take a hit with the seatbelt in this position, I could be decapitated...seriously.  My biggest complaint.  Again, dealer said it works as it should and there is no fix.  The car also randomly disallows me to unlock.  Fresh batteries - remote out - doesn't matter.  It just freezes up for minutes.  The doors rattle and vibrate from any bass whatsoever, since a week after I took delivery.   I'd expect this in a standard Chevy or KIA but not in a car of this price & supposed quality.  Dealer said that I should try lowering the bass.  By now you're getting the sense of the appallingly low quality of customer satisfaction provided by #1 Cochran Infiniti in Wexford, PA. Incidentally, they wet wash your car post-service and expect you to dry it...BMW and Mercedes - never.  Definitely didn't expect perfection - just expected better for the brand and the money.  360 days and I'm out.

infiniti,q60,2017,RohanB, 05/30/2018,Glad I rented it before buying it - Beware,3,"I rented a pretty sweet Infiniti Q60 with the 6-cylinder/300HP engine over the long weekend. Drove about 1,000 miles over Wyoming and Utah, exposed to city and country driving. Interior: Very comfortable but the quality and fit/finish doesn't match up to the Germans. It actually doesn't match up to the quality of fit and finish of my 2012 VW GTI. Exterior: FREAKING BEAUTIFUL. This has to be most beautiful and attention grabbing design within the 50-60K price bracket (save for a Mustang). Everyone takes double looks and it definitely appears like a 100K car. Performance: Straight line performance is amazing, could have a nicer exhaust, but there are several aftermarket solutions without making it sound ricer. Now for the part why I would NOT recommend this car - Steering and Safety: The steering has a mind of it's own - I was constantly making minor corrections on a straight piece of highway doing the speed limit (70 MPH).  It seems like the adaptive steering tries to second guess the driver, but as the driver, you don't expect the car to make that correction by itself so you either end up overcorrecting or jerking/lurching the car. Lane changes on the highway became difficult. THE WORST PART - When doing 70MPH in moderate rain, this car almost wiped out. This was again, on a straight piece of road, the steering system twitched and sent the car into a near wipeout, as I almost lost the rear end of this AWD car. I ended up bringing it back in control, but never felt comfortable driving it again, especially since I had my wife in the car and wiping out at 70MPH would have definitely injured (or worse) us both. Absolutely do not recommend this car - I have driven econoboxes that would do better in the rain at these speeds (including my elantra, civic) as well as my amazing (now even more so) VW GTI

infiniti,q60,2017,DavidB, 07/21/2018,Beware steering system twitch,2,"I am glad to be here writing this review.  Also very glad to read RohanB revuew confirming what happen to me (see his review here to).  Like RohanB I was renting this car and had my son with me.  I was less fortunate than RohanB I ended up hitting the guard rail and spinning around luckily did not hit any other vehicle.  Just like his review going down highway it was raining.  If I recall right I was just easily sliding into middle lane and then it went hard right and felt like hydroplaning.  I have been driving for almost 30 years. I am not a speeder no speeding ticket since my teenage years.  Thank God the other safety features was awesome in the car.  We both got out okay...my son had a few bruises...but we are alive and well.  I do have the headache of dealing with an out of state wreck but will take that vs other options!  There is your PSA from me stay away from adaptive steering technology.  Perhaps 99% ok but it's the 1% that matters when it's life or death.  I had no idea I was renting a car with that technology.  Hert had a row of cars to pick from and since I was with my son we picked the cool looking car! It sure was cool looking.  Lesson learned do quick review of car safety issues before picking car at rental.

infiniti,q60,2017,Johnny, 09/26/2018,A coupe like no other!,4,"What do I mean by a coupe like no other? Just that. As I was shopping for a new coupe, it came down to 3 cars. The A5 and BMW 430i came really close to cutting it but the Q60 was just a bit more attractive to look at. There are multiple cons about the vehicle but also a lot of pros that helped me decide on this car. My biggest issue was the fact that here you have such a handsome car paired to an infotainment that isn't as advanced as something you'd get in a Camry. The double screen is a very nice design but the top screen does minimal stuff (mainly for the navigation IF equipped). There is no Apple Carplay or Android Auto available. I payed $51,000 for this car and it does not have Apple Carplay. Same goes for my Infiniti Q50. They share the same infotainment center. Infiniti needs to step up their game with the technology. They're starting to come up as a legitimate luxury brand. They still have some ways to go before being fully competitive against rivals like Audi, Mercedes, Lexus, ETC,. Also the fact that at that price range there is no heated seats and remote start was a bit of a bummer. Also, Infiniti's new technology used for the steering is a bit too new and I keep that in consideration when I say the car is always a bit late in responsiveness when steering. It's as if you steer and the car has too think for a half a second to do it. It may seem like nothing but believe me, you definitely feel it when driving. Aside from all of that, the car overall is built very nicely. There are so many soft touch surfaces in the car and Infiniti does a good job at keeping away cheap plastic. My Q60 came standard with Bose Performance Series audio system which was very nice touch. The outer exterior of the car is simply gorgeous. From the headlights to the side of the car and following through to the back, this car (to me at least) has no bad angle. Also a 300hp 3.0 twin turbo helps make driving quite the adventure. So if you're considering a new coupe take it from me. It's not a perfect car and it has it's flaws...HOWEVER...its a very nice car that will get you compliments and you don't see them on the road as much. Plenty of power for fun driving although the car does feel a little heavy. Even with it's quirks, I would in a hearbeat get another Q60. I honestly enjoy driving it and I think it makes for a very solid choice as a coupe option.

Puts out 100% touque to the rear and turns better than 135i. Also with driver assist package makes it much safer feeling and it's a frickin sexy luxury car. I'm extremely satisfied.
"
infiniti,q60,2017,TJ Saye, 02/07/2018,Buy it.,4,"Listen, I realize there are a lot of good options in this price range. I know because I've owned most of them. I've been driving the Red Sport now for just under a year... and I'm very, very pleased with the purchase.  It's a beautiful car.  Inside and out.  Fun to drive.  Fast enough.  In general terms, there aren't many on the road here in Chicagoland... so it gets a ton of looks and comments.  I also splurged for the lit front logo, which really pops the car at night. Very sharp. The other thing that separated this vehicles from similar options was the AWD.  It handles like gem in poor conditions.  Sure, sharp turns on a road with four inches of snow is going to create some sliding (like yesterday with my wife yelling at me) but all in all, it handles very well in bad conditions.  I have a steep driveway which looks menacing in snow... and it conquers it like a Jeep during each snow storm.  Heck, I pass Jeeps in the snow in this car.  So, no problems or worries in bad weather.  Yes, there are some imperfections.  There's some repetitiveness with controls.  Also, while the car does have a backup camera, there's no sensor.  Since the vehicle is a sports car... there are times when it's difficult to see what's behind you... and without the sensor... near impossible if another car or person is rolling through a parking lot behind you. One more thing, the car is really beautiful, however, I think they should have added a few more external design options to clearly differentiate it as a Red Sport.  At first glance, it really looks the same as other Q60's--and it's not. That's pretty much it. I love the car and would highly recommend it to anyone interested.

infiniti,q60,2017,John, 08/16/2018,Electronic steering is great!,5,"I have read a lot of reviews bashing the electronic steering. Unless you have a stage coach, having a feel for every pebble on the road  an be cumbersome, on long trips. The Q60 is a Grand Touring style coupe.  It gives comfort and performance in one package. I have leased the 2017 and 2018 red sport models. The first a rwd and the second awd.  The Bose sound system is great. The collision avoidance works very well, and the pro pilot assist greatly reduces fatigue on long road trips. Whenever I drive a car without the electronic steering it feel very tedious to drive. I suppose those that don't like it or compare it to a playstation or xbox, just haven't had enough time behind the wheel of a Q60 to realize that it is a good thing.  The acceleration in this car is very very nice. It is a beautiful car that brings admirers everytime I go anywhere. Mercedes style looks boring, Volkswagon interiors are cheap and BMW doesn't bring the bang for the buck. Hands down the Infinity Q60 is a worthy successor of the G35 and G37 of yore.  This car drives at 160mph as smooth as 20mph. Anyone looking for road feel should drive a hydraulically assisted steering vehicle on gravel roads.  I like my drive smooth as possible without having to fight the steering wheel. Way to go Infinity!

I'm not sure why the critics hate this car, because the car is great. The fun factor is through the roof. Don't buy the 2.0t, you will miss the V6 3.0t.

Carmax did an oil change on it when they got it. Had an issue a month in and had it towed to Carmax. The car lost power and was in limp mode. Carmax subbed the work to Infiniti. Infiniti couldn’t replicate the issue (P011) and gave the car back to me.  Had squealing a couple months later and they replaced the belt tensioner. I followed the recommended 10k/12mos oil change. Had it done at Carmax.  A couple months ago 49k miles now, the car started overheating. No check engine lights, no codes. Towed it to Infiniti and they said I needed to provide the maintenance records from the first owner or they would deny the warranty. Their denial letter says lack of maintenance is their reason for denial. Well, I don’t have them so I asked Carmax to step in with my maxcare warranty I purchased. They are denying to do any work either.  Now I have a $27000 lawn ornament. Infiniti won’t listen to me plead my case on their car. How did they not catch this issue with the first visit?

I've been driving my Q60 Redsport for over a year now, and it's still incredibly fun! The sport plus mode is insane, and I love using it on long country roads...BUT, I live in Chicagoland and the snow in the winter made my GT Mustang spin in circles- not this car. It grips the road and I feel completely safe (AWD). I can't say enough good things about this car. It's comfortable (even on long drives), fun to drive, not bad fuel economy...the tech they use in the center console is only average, so that's my only negative. I haven't had a single issue with this vehicle, and it's a first gen 2017. I'd buy this car again and again! Just FYI, I do not have the adaptive steering in this car and it's very responsive. I swear the brakes on this car saved my life once...and it looks HOT! People come up to me when I'm gassing up and ask me about the car. Sweeeet!

infiniti,q60,2018,Dorran Williams, 01/18/2019,WIDE EYE for The RED SPORT,2,"I got the 2018 Q60S Red Sport, and have had it for about 2 months now. I have read the reviews on it and agree with some of them and disagree with some as well. One of the things a disagree with is the trunk space. The reviews on it say the trunk space is way too small. If you are buying a luxury sports car, you are not buying it for the trunk. The trunk in the Red Sport can fit plenty of groceries, or 2 small suit cases in it(I have done it). Now to what I agree with, the screens. The reviews say the screen are a little outdated or from two different areas. Most cars these days, like Chevy, Ford, and even Jeep have Apple play in them. These are not even Luxury Car companies. Infiniti needs to listen to its people like me who have bought 5,6, and even 7 Infiniti's and counting and upgrade to Apple play or something better. Not only that, The printing/writing on the screen is very hard to read(very small). My family is an Infiniti family but we would love to see these small little changes.

infiniti,q60,2018,F. Peloso, 10/05/2018,Q60 Owner,5,"Great looking and performing automobile. Got the AWD 3.0 Coupe model. Very quick and responsive.  Quality construction, handles very nicely and is a real pleasure to drive.  Gas mileage is OK around town and good on trips.  Very satisfied customer.  Also, must give credit to the dealership.  Faulkner Infiniti of Willow Grove, PA.  Great team of folks who handled the sale and delivery.  A team that is both professional and classy.  So far, I am a satisfied customer.

infiniti,q60,2018,C MC, 01/08/2019,Love the new body style,5,"I had the first generation G37 Journey Coupe and kept it until trading it for this 2018 Q60. I absolutely love this car and love the AWD. It hugs the road much tighter than the RWD. Braking power is exceptional. There was literally a car that dead stopped in road today while everyone was going 50mph. The car in front of me hit the car that stopped, my car actually stopped right before I thought I was going to rear end the guy. The back end of this AWD never swung around on me. A RWD would have. But, this Q60 will get up and go. Gas mileage is the same as my G37. There’s more trunk room in this car when comparing to the older 2 door coupes. This car hugs the road though like my touring 350z roadster did and this is not the red sport. I love the AWD. This car is fun to drive and is sharp. It’s wicked looking with the running lights and at night, it’s even more wicked looking. The only thing I don’t like about it having some controls on the console. My dog gets into those and there’s been blank screens pop up as we’ve been going down the road! So, I have to guard the buttons when the dog is in the car. She was used to laying and propping her head on the console due to her size.  She’s adamant that she sits in the front seat! That’s the only negative with this vehicle are the placement of the controls on the console. Another drawback are the tires, they are run flat tires and substantially higher than normal tires. However, the original tires lasted about 30,000 miles. They can be rotated, so that is a plus. But there is no jack or spare tire in the trunk.

infiniti,q60,2018,Rick M., 04/07/2019,2018 Q60S AWD is definitely the sweet spot!,5,"First and foremost, this “S” model is a SPORT coupe, not a sport sedan compromise nor a family hauler.  If you really need more trunk space, just fold down the rear seatback... you’ll have room to spare.  In “silver” Sport trim (discontinued for 2019), you’ll get everything important in the Red Sport... adaptive suspension, 14” brakes, paddle shifters, etc...  except with “only” 300hp.  The 400hp version VR30 DDTT engine is structurally identical, with the exception of an extra intercooler water pump and turbo speed monitor... those additional 100hp come from upping turbo boost from 9.7 lbs to nearly 15 lbs.!  When equipped with the electrical assist mechanical rack steering with standard and sport settings,  maneuverability and handling are flawless.  This car has been a joy to drive, as my daily driver as well as weekend getaways.  No regets!
"
infiniti,q60,2018,David Allsopp, 11/17/2018,Slippery!!,5,"I didn't buy the AWD and it's almost impossible to use all that power because the back end drifts when slightly pushed.  I know how to use the power effectively as I've had powerful vehicles for years but trying to get anything aggressive out of a 0-60 without losing the rear is near impossible.  This is a wonderful car for the money and lots of fun to drive.  Would highly recommend it but do go for the AWD

infiniti,q60,2018,Steph T, 03/30/2019,Very happy,5,"I went in to test drive the 2.0, but after driving the 3.0, I was hooked.

infiniti,q60,2019,Carla, 10/21/2019,My beautiful Infiniti!,4,"Excellent gas mileage, and no problem passing any vehicle on the road. The trunk is small but this is strictly my car, so packing my small/medium size bags into the trunk isn’t an issue. It drives and handles well, and takes curves really well. Much more comfortable seats and ride compared to my BMW. This is my first Infiniti after driving a BMW for several years. It doesn’t have a spare/donut if you have a flat. That can be a very bad situation if you hit a pothole that slices your tire open to make driving impossible. This is really bad when you’re a female driving out of state, in the mountains, in the middle of no where with poor cellular reception. So you definitely want to take that in consideration. I travel a lot so this will probably be the reason I will be trading my q60 in the near future.

infiniti,q60,2020,Karen L, 08/30/2020,A Scintillating Jewel,5,"This car is a unique mix of sleek styling and muscularity.  A wide stance, sporty wheels and the sleek design give way to an understated classy luxury when you open the door.  You can drive it like a roadster or have it carry you with elegant grace.  The best thing I can say about the Q60 is how it makes you feel.  Satiated!"
infiniti,q60,2020,PG, 10/19/2020,Refined Power and Limited Technology,4,"If you are a returning Infiniti customer and you enjoyed the benefits of using the InTouch Services app on your phone, be prepared to loose all of that functionality.  Right now, this FLAGSHIP car doesn't work with the current version of the app. So (from within the app), you lose Remote Start (from anywhere), Find My Vehicle, Send Directions to Car, Vehicle Health Report, Valet Mode, Curfew alerts, Perimeter alerts, and Speed alerts. Yes, you would pay extra to have these features, but the fact that these are no longer an option is FRUSTRATING. There are other aspects of the onboard software that were modified (or, eliminated) to accommodate Apple & Android Car Play.  Like most of all the other reviews I read or viewed, the power of the vehicle is outstanding... it just doesn't sound like it.  This vehicle in Sport+ mode should make a lot more exhaust noise. The Suspension in this vehicle is different from all of the other Infiniti vehicles... and this is a good thing in my book.  It handles rough surfaces very well. My vehicle came with the exterior Carbon Fiber package which, for over $2280, is not worth it.  The paddle shifters in this car are a nice black color, but they are plastic... however, they are very responsive and the downshift rev matching is great. This car does not come with upgraded floor mats, which was very surprising, as, again, the Q60 Red Sport AWD is a flagship vehicle. Very powerful engine, yet comfortable to drive.  Sometimes, it's exhilarating, but not exactly fun... I'd opt for an Audi TTS for that.

infiniti,q60,2020,Christian, 12/02/2020,"A sleek, beautiful coupe",4,"I agree with reviewers that this car is far behind the competition in terms of technological prowess. But what the Germans have forgotten is that a vehicle is more than just a spectacular interior...it needs to LOOK the part too. I have found that the materials inside are nice and that the lighting is sleek and understated especially with the silver optic fiber trim and red leather. Ultimately, do we really care about a digital gauge cluster that much? She is a little porky but many of the drawbacks can be fixed: different tires, a performance exhaust. Fix those things and pick up a Red Sport for under 40K and you have the best looking car under about 65K but you paid almost 30K less...Seriously. Everything else worth driving is over 75K - Lexus LC500, used Jaguar F-Type R... "
infiniti,q70,2014,tntstark, 02/04/2015,Rattle in the dash with less than 200 miles,3,"I purchased this car three days ago.  Before the odometer hit 200 miles, the dash had a rattle anytime I drove on any road that wasn't perfectly smooth.  The eight year old Mercedes I traded in for this car had no rattles when driven on the same roads and it was a soft top.  This is completely unaccepted for a brand new upscale vehicle."
infiniti,q70,2015,Adam LeRoy, 07/29/2016,Best car in class...what went wrong Edmunds???,5,"Having been in the market for a mid sized luxury vehicle for a few months I decided it would be best to drive all the vehicles in the class except the Audi A6. Audi and I don't get along hahaha. Ill start by saying all vehicles I tested had their pluses and minuses and were all really good cars. In short the Lexus GS350 was the only other one that wasn't ""boring"" to me, but it didn't have the ""it"" factor I was looking for. The BMW 535i and the Mercedes E350 felt really stale and old if that makes sense. Almost as if these would be great cars for my grandparents to drive. In steps the Infiniti Q70 Sport. Everything about this car I love. from the aggressive styling to the performance of the tried and true VQ engine. This car just does it for me. Not to mention the room inside the cabin. Being 6'5"" and 250 I'm not a small guy and while driving the Inifiniti I don't feel cramped in at all. I can also sit in the back seat comfortably without hunching over. I can't remember the last time I was able to do that in a car....maybe 8th grade??? Now I will admit this car is a touch edgy, but in a good way. I love cars and like to feel connected to the road and not taken away from it like some of the others in that class have done. So If you are looking for a Sports Luxury sedan that looks fantastic and performs well while zipping around town look no further than the Infiniti Q70.

infiniti,q70,2015,David, 05/04/2016,"The ""Pros"" Are All Wrong!",5,"This is absolutely a wonderful car.  I have driven MBZ for the past 25 years (1985 500SEL, 1998 & 2002 E320) and while those were good cars, when looking around for this purchase none of the MBZ (E), Audi (A6), Lexus (ES, GS), BMW (5) were as comfortable to get in and out of or be in as the Q70L.  And this car has tremendous rear seat space, very much appreciated by our adult and very adult-sized kids.
Good acceleration and handling, the mileage is a little better than expected, climate controls good, very comfortable overall.  Yes, I got a tremendous deal because I bought a 2015 that had been around for a while, so that just adds to my excitement.  My cost of ownership won't be anywhere near as high as what Edmunds or the other guys calculate.  I'm very happy with my decision.
"
infiniti,q70,2015,Justin L. Williams, 09/01/2015,Former Mercedes owner says Infinity better car,5,"I have owned 5 Mercedes including an S Class car. I compared this car to the Mercedes E350 and lower end S class cars, the Audi8 and the BMW's. It is definitely bigger than the E350 and about the same as the Audi, maybe the same or slightly larger, feeling than the S class? I have not compared the specs they will tell you but I am 6'1"" and when sitting in the back can't touch the front seat and when in the front it is huge. I bought the car because of the technology package which is one of the tops on the market. The car has a smooth ride, quickly passes cars on the highway and is a joy to drive. This may be the best value luxury car on the market. I strongly suggest the ""L"" edition for the extra room.

infiniti,q70,2015,Jasper Newton, 07/24/2015,Great ride for tall guys,5,"After ten years with g35 I made the move to the q70 after driving Cadillac CTS and Hyundai Genesis. I like that it sits a bit higher for easier entry for a taller guy--I'm 6'5"". And, I have tons of headroom and leg room. Even with moonroof which I haven't had in all prior cars due to my height. The handling isn't as crisp as g35 but it is a bigger car and I was ready for the extra room. Still handles very nicely. I like the Sport mode best--closer the the great handling of the G35. Gas mileage is only mediocre but that wasn't an issue for my needs. Love all the tech stuff--voice activated blue tooth, nav, locks, etc.  I like the looks of the exterior and the looks, cush, pampering of the interior. Hoping for the same great reliability of my g35.

Well, it's one year later and I'm still satisfied. The all wheel drive was great in the winter snow.  Absolutely no maintenance problems (which will jinx me, for sure).

infiniti,q70,2015,Ed Collins, 03/21/2016,"Infiniti Q70S: Underrated, High Value",5,"Having lived with an Infiniti Q70S for six months, I can say that it is supremely competent and at $56K loaded beats its competition by a mile. Very good looking in a unique way (unlike it's anodyne competitors), extremely comfortable, very nimble for a large car (as in the same size as a BMW 740 or an Audi A8). 330 HP paired with the 7 speed transmission and 14"" disc brakes, 20"" wheels and the adjustable sport suspension is plenty. 

Also capable in difficult road conditions; last week we hammered through no less than six thunderstorms on an interstate with no difficulty. 

And perhaps the most important item from the vanity point of view: the valets always put the Q70S in the front row. So you've got competence, reliability, good looks, good handling, and a reasonable price going here. What could be wrong with that?

******************************

Update March 2017. Perfectly acceptable large sedan at a huge value compared to its competitors. Buyers who are concerned with extremely high performance (as in, cars with 400 hp and up) should look elsewhere). But the Q70S 3.7 is a supreme long distance cruiser (up to 155 mph) and is more than handy on twisty roads.  No mechanical issues of any kind.  Exterior paint is gorgeous as are 20"" wheels and show no wear. Interior materials excellent after a year in use.  

A buyer has to consider what I call the shark look.  I personally like the look a lot in the S version with 20"" wheels and big brakes. It's so not anodyne as its competitors. A matter of taste; do you follow the crowd or do you want something distinctive?
"
infiniti,q70,2015,Leighton Rockafellow, 03/15/2016,Great car at a great price,5,"Shop Infiniti first and you will go no further.  I have owned Cadillacs, Lincoln's, Mercedes and Jaguar.   Nothing comes close to the price and quality advantage of an Infiniti.  This time around I seriously considered another Jaguar, but one ride in the Q70L quickly convinced me that Infiniti had hit another home run.  These are great cars.  These are beautiful cars.  These are reliable cars.  As the slogan says: ""Own one and you will understand.""

2nd review request:  I repeat all of the above.  I see Infiniti now has a self drive option on the new QX50.  I can't wait to try it.  I have owned or leased 6 Infiniti products and my daughter is on her 4th Infiniti product.  We love these cars.  The quality and price can't be matched by anyone.

infiniti,q70,2015,minfed, 05/25/2015,Impressive Q70L,5,"In the last 7 years I have owned a Cadillac and a Lexus GS. After thinking I wanted to buy another Lexus, they have made the body style way to edgy for my taste. Cadillac also is taking on edgy lines and too many upgrades to make what you want an additional $10K in package cost. I also test drove the Lincoln MKZ & MKS, both left me very unimpressed. 
My husband said I've always liked Infinity's let's see what the new ones have to offer. Started off test driving the Q50, very stylish and was a comfy ride, however it lack all the power functions including cold seats that my Lexus spoiled me with. Then they showed my the Q70L... It was LOVE at first sight, what a beautiful car.

infiniti,q70,2015,Emir, 08/13/2015,Excellent car!,5,"I test drove few cars in this class and Q70 came up on top.  It seamed to be larger then Audi A6, Lexus GS350, BMW 528 and Mercedes E 350 (cars I test drove).  It was very quick for the size of that car.  It handles perfect, the ride is smooth and quiet, but Lexus is quieter.  V6 engine is powerful and responds quick especially in Sport mode.  I love the exterior and interior look.  It has good touch screen navigation (wish it was a bigger and HD), Bluetooth is awesome, sound is very good, brake assistance, blind spot, lane departure and correction is all very good .   It takes few days to get familiar with all the buttons, but once you are familiar you'll be perfectly fine with all of it.

infiniti,q70,2015,Geoff, 08/16/2015,The Edmunds reviewer is flat out wrong....,5,"...or  drove some other car! I own a Q 70 for about a month now. Like most people, I test drove all the major competitors. The Q70 engine is one of the great V6 engines around. The same that is on the Nissan 370Z. The base engine accelerates faster than a BMW 535ix and Mercedes E350. The brakes on the Q 70 are great and the audio system is better than what you get on either the 5 series or E class. The interior fit and finish is probably the best as well. I did like the Audio A6 and the A7 interior I really liked! But overall, the Q70 is very comfortable but as someone mentioned the Lexus GS 350 and Acura RLX have quitter ride, although the Q to me has better overall fit and finish and much better styling.

It seems to me the Edmunds reviewer did not drove this car at all. He was also wrong on that the premium package is included and not extra even on the base config.

Of course nothing will match the Tesla's acceleration and sharp handling, but the Q70L is more suited to normal driving.  The rear seating comfort is excellent and the transmission shifts so smoothly you almost feel like you are driving a Tesla.  The electronics and collision avoidance are Excellent!  My 2013 Tesla did not have 4 wheel drive which makes it totally unsuitable in Denver so I traded it for my Infinity Q70L and I have been very pleased.  Both front and rear leg room also are the best of any car I have ever owned.

There is not another single car company out there that can beat the quality that Infiniti offers. Not a single one!! You dont buy a car like this for fuel economy. This car has power and very comfortable for short trips and long hauls. You feel safe in this car. The folks in the back seat have plenty of leg room and equal comfort. You won't be disappointed in this car!!

infiniti,q70,2015,Rey W., 07/31/2015,Incredible value on an excellent car!,5,"I bought a fully loaded Q70S after a very careful review and test drives that included the Jaguar XF AWD Portfolio, the Audi A7 and A6, the BMW 528i and 435. Based on a mix of performance, comfort, features and cost the top 2 were the Jaguar and the Q70S AWD. To me the Jag looked better, but the Infiniti drove better in the sport configuration and has more space for rear passengers. All I can say is that unless what you're looking for is a BMW (because there are people who specifically like a BMW - in which case everything else will fall short) or are Looking to maximize your prestige the Q70 is an excellent choice to consider.

infiniti,q70,2015,Christian, 10/22/2019,Great used car but not worth buying new!,3,"Pros and Cons (After driving it for a year)

It hasn’t been updated forever, but the exterior/interior design still looks very good.  Still has a nice flow to it.  Hermosa Blue exterior and graphite interior is a nice color combination as well.
With Deluxe Touring Package, Premium Package, Technology Package, and Performance Tire & Wheel Package, my car stickered at $63k.  But it doesn’t drive/feel like a premium luxury car when compared to the fit/finish of other luxury brands.  My car was a lease turn in and in excellent condition with just 30k miles with brand new tires.  I had paid $28k in Oct. 2018 with still decent warranty remaining.  It was a lot of car for the money as used but not as new at $63k.  Infiniti has to give deep discounts to move them as new.
20 inch wheels really make the car look outstanding.
Huge legroom in the back and overall very spacious.  
Power rear doors is a nice touch.  But why not the front?
Safety features are very nice.
Good power and has been reliable.

Areas where Infiniti can improve to compete with other premium luxury brands:
Improve ride quality.  Ride is too coarse, too stiff, and unrefined for premium luxury car.  Ride needs more composure while still being sporty.  Improve suspension.
Too noisy on the road.  Improve sound insulation.
All Interior materials including the dash/door, all buttons, knobs for volume/heated seats, leather seat quality, can use upgrade.  Still too much plastic.  They feel old and cheap.  It doesn’t look much different from Nissan.
Doors need to close more solidly.  Feels too light and cheap.
Needs power open/close trunk.  
The car needs to be 2-3 inches wider.  Car looks great from the side but too narrow from the front/back.  
Improve stereo.  Even with Bose 16 speaker option, it’s still not up to par when compared to other premium stereos.
Design new key fob.  It’s same as Nissan. 
Improve Keyless Entry.  Doors need to unlock without pressing a button.
Improve the touch screen, navigation graphics, and cameras.  Needs better resolution for the cameras.

You get a lot of car for the money as used but not worth buying new.  

04/22/2020 update:  I traded it in for 2016 BMW 535xi with sport package.  Very happy with my purchase.  If only had the Q70L better finish and composure, I'd have kept it for a long time.

infiniti,q70,2015,Charles Stephens, 01/29/2017,Not Another Lexus,4,"I love this car. I've owned 2 Lexus, 2 Infiniti (3 now) and a Mercedes S. This may be my favorite car. (2001 RX300 still not out of the running) But the Q70L is luxe. sexy, and fast. One thing I think Infiniti gets right almost all the time is ergonomics. All the buttons are within reach and easy to use with multiple ways to accomplish the same task. It feels like it was made for me, customizable for how you want to interact with the car. We're tall people 6' & 6'5"" and there is more than enough room no matter where you are. The 360 camera system should be the standard on ALL cars, that alone would keep me coming back.

Gas mileage is horrific at 15mpg. using premium fuel, handling depends on the road surface, uneven pavement and the car is all over the road, Technology for the Flagship Q70 is behind the Q50 series, If you are really into this vehicle wait until the 2021 Q70 which will have some fresh upgrades.

The vehicle hesitates still which caused a accident, problems were never fixed by Infiniti, finally had to git rid of the vehicle in February, 2020 it was just to Dangerous To Drive. I feared for my safety and others.

The long haul drive from Denver to Florida, 23 hours was comfortable.  Where its is for every day city driving or zooming up the mountain this was a great car and I miss it.

infiniti,q70,2015,Margaret, 08/30/2015,Easily one of the best in class,5,"The Q70 has a stunning interior with excellent fit and finish. The combination of technology and design in the inside is really second to none. Not sure what the reviewer here is talking about, but the engine and ride quality on the Q 70 is great. I have been driving a 2015 for a little over 2 months now and I could not be happier with the car.

I really like the active noise cancellation feature. The acceleration is very quick - easily at par with a BMW 335ix in my opinion. 

Along with the Audi A7, I find the Q70S exterior styling to be the best in class as well. But that is a personal choice. Overall, I'd highly recommend this car. My last car was a 2009 Mercedes C 300 4 Matic (fully loaded). I considered the E350 and Acura RLX as well.

The Q70L is definitely the way to go, and the other luxury car companies that offer the long wheel base are at least 20k more.  The engine power is great.  I get so many compliments from other people saying what a great looking car.  I have the pearl white exterior and java interior.  I love this car, and for the price and reliability, you can't go wrong.  It gets bad publicity, but for the price and quality it can't be beat.

infiniti,q70,2015,James R., 05/25/2016,Problems: If you want more problems than you......,1,"Update- car is worse than in beginning, on 3rd set of tires at 39k miles and all original problems still there.....Since the time I started this car for the first time at the dealer it has had nothing but problems. First when the A/C is on the car sounds like a jumbo jet trying to take off but can't (you can even hear it over the radio) and guests always ask me ""whats wrong with your car?"". The service department told me they can't fix it because ""they all make this noise and Infiniti knows it"". Next the car grabs every rut in the road and flies all over the place and when I say ""flies"" I mean way beyond a safety concern. The problem even gets worse when braking. Also there is a buzz noise when driving the car that you can hear over the radio but the dealer says ""they can't hear it and they can't fix it"". I could go on and on about how bad this car is but to tell you the truth I have already waste so much of my time on trying to get this car fix and trying to get Infiniti the car company to do something about it (which they won't & they have told me this one 3 different occasions) i just can't stand this car anymore. If you want all the problem you can handle and then some please buy one of these cars. I thought this was going to be a great fast and cool car but all it turned out to be was a huge waste of my time and money. Sincerely, a 3 time new Infiniti buyer and owner (also a disgusted customer of Infiniti). *******

update at 39000 miles: WORST car I have ever purchased, all of the problems have persisted, A/C whines louder than I can turn the radio uo to cover it up, brakes start shaking every 3000 miles and it is not because I ride the brakes, tires wear out at 18000 miles, just a terrible terrible experience with a brand new luxury car. Nissan North America/Infiniti has refused to do anything about the concerns I have. I only thing I have to look forward to is the day I trade this car in which is quickly approaching.

Update at 45000 miles. All problems at still happening and Infiniti hasn’t contacted me to resolve any of them. Worst car ever.

Update: 46500 miles = worst car ever!

infiniti,q70,2016,RWD Fan, 06/18/2018,Perfect for my needs but I need to watch my speed!,4,"I'm upgrading from my beloved 2008 truck because I need to tote the elderly parents back and forth.  Got a used Acura RDX in the interim but I couldn't stand the FWD dynamics although it was a definite improvement technology and ease of entry for me.  My gently-used Infiniti Q70L is perfect for my current needs - I like to say I bought the back seats for Mom and Dad and the rest for me!  It is a truly sharp-looking car and I believe a significantly safer car for me as I burn up the highways 3 hrs 1-way back and forth every week to look after the folks.  I never lack for power or acceleration and it is truly a road warrior for me.  Blue-tooth connectivity is awful as I can no longer read or respond to texts - but I honestly think this may be Divine Intervention for me (as I acknowledge it leads to distracted driving so I've accepted it and it no longer bothers me - I just warn people that I'm trying to meet up with to call, not text me when I'm on my way).  Climate control is COLD and accurate but the fans associated with the cooled seats are loud.  I still use them all the time, however, living in the Southeast.  It's a physically beautiful car that is a joy to drive.  Quick acceleration, tight turning radius, back to commanding RWD,  a beast on the interstate, and not a pain to park in a city parking deck. 

Update: still love this smooth highway cruiser after a year of ownership and 26k more miles. Incredibly comfortable; powerful; planted at speed. And my elderly parents can still get in/out easier than any other vehicle with wheelchair in the backseat and 2 walkers in the trunk.

infiniti,q70,2017,jhawk , 04/16/2018,Excellent value in a great car!,5,"If brand name is all that matters then yes please overpay for a German brand. 

I had a 2015 AWD Q50 premium and decided after 2 1/2 years to trade in for something a bit bigger. 

The dealership gave me an awesome deal on a 2017 Q70S AWD. A deal so good actually that I ended up paying less for this than I did for my Q50. 

Now I know this car does not fully compete against the finest midsize luxury cars but infiniti is always running deals on these so you have to put it in perspective. Infiniti does need to redesign to keep up with the latest but it is still is a fine and comfortable driving car. 

You have to put it in perspective when it comes to value:

I paid $42,000 for a $57,000 stickered car and for that money with AWD, a sport package, bose radio, heated and cooled seats, navigation, sunroof, great seats, a comfortable ride and many standard features it was a no brainer. 

Not many cars you could consider for this price point that are this fun to drive and luxurious! 

The Q70 handles well, has good power, is very comfortable, good space for 4 people and is an attractive looking car and has AWD. For that type of money you can’t really ask for much more...plus this car is more fun to drive and more pleasant than the Q50 (more communication in the steering, quieter/more comfortable when cruising and has a better sound from the engine). 

Overall an great car at a excellent value price! "
infiniti,q70,2017,ACW3426, 12/06/2019,Infiniti Q70H hybrid,5,"Infiniti Q70H is a car overlooked by a lot of people, it is a very practical and reliable car in my opinion.
I owned 4 Infiniti cars before, one thing I can vouture for the Infiniti brand is their reliability, I have never been stranded before , their strength is on their engine and transmission, accessories including air conditioning can go way over 100k miles without major issues. Their structure integrity is also good, I walked away from a serious highway accident,the car is totaled although still drivable.
As for the hybrid , it is smoother than the Lexus es300h, my wife owned the Lexus hybrid, and I have the opportunity to compare both, the performance is good, the mileage figure is on the ballpark of EPA rating, I got consistent 28 mpg.
The most impressive feature in my opinion is their technology package, Infiniti semi-autonomous driving technology is way ahead of a lot of other car companies, I feel safe driving with it in my long commute every day.
All in all a great car.

I had the chance to drive this car for couple thousand miles. It's definitely not the most competitive in the class, but Edmunds' review is absolutely terrible and biased. Their whole article screams one sentence - buy German car, don't buy Q70. ""no Q70 variant truly stands out in the crowd""??? Seriously??? Look at how many A6 and E class are on the road, and you tell me Q70 does not stand out? To be completely honest Q70 isn't the most attractive design but it has a very strong presence when you see it. Oh and I see Edmunds gave 1 star for Q70's technology. Sure the tech is not up to date, the screen is not the most crisp and the largest. BUT even for today's standards I found the system very intuitive and easy to use even for the first time, and the NAV never got me a problem. Now it comes where Edmunds lose all the credit, where in the driving aids section it says ""It's almost unheard of in this class for items such as blind-spot monitoring and forward collision warning to be optional."" What a joke. I guess you are just ignoring the fact that German cars nickel and dime you for every single piece of desirable feature? And not to mention Q70 is one of the most reliable luxury cars in the market right now! If you enjoy paying repair bills and loaner cars from the dealer -  go ahead and buy German and enjoy.

Dealer service has been outstanding.  The car sells for a lot less than the BMW740, the Mercedes E350, or the Lexus GS350.  Also a 330 HP engine is standard.  I like everything about the Q70L, except for the GPS system.  Exterior and interior quality is excellent.  The exterior looks great; the front  ene reminds me of a shark.  The ride is very smooth, even with the 20 inche wheels.  Others may think the exhaust acceleration nice is high, but I like the sound of the engine exhaust when I floor the gas.  The Q70L has a large interior, and an especially roomy rear seat and leg room.  I have no regrets about buying this car, and Infiniti of Raleigh has given me outstanding service.  A beautiful car!

infiniti,q70,2019,K.San, 07/23/2019,Under appreciated Great Luxury Car!,5,"I did lots of shopping before decide to go with Infiniti Q70L.  I like the styling of Q70L and mine came with all packages possible including driver assist, the car looks amazing in black on black combination and it is perfect for road trips, the extra 6"" leg room is unmatchable in the class and puts this car almost in S class category.  the interior quality and comfort is exceptional and everywhere you touch is real trim and soft to the touch, the only hard touch spot I found is the bottom of B pillar cover.  The interior is isolated from outside with all noise insulations in doors and double pane glasses and active noise cancellation system.  All the advanced safety functions that come in the driver assist package are icing on the cake and they all work pretty well and few times so far have saved us from sticky situations.  The 3.7 V6 330hp engine has plenty of power and is very responsive, however I found the transmission in standard mode to be slightly slow in downshifts which can be fixed if you put it in sports mode.  The kids love the soft closing feature on rear doors and trunk and I wished INFINITI would have added that to front doors as well, just don't understand why is not included. The infotainment system is the only area that I can say this car lacks and the interface is very dated with no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto (Come on Infiniti! Really?! It's 2020 already), however the 16 speaker Bose system produces very great sound.  With the incentives that Infiniti and dealers offer on these sedans there is no room for thinking on purchasing any other luxury brand vehicle unless you are brand oriented person.

It'll be just me 90% of the time and will seldom use the backseat, as we are empty nesters and my wife has a larger SUV. After a lot of research I found the QX30. Previously I owned a G37 and liked the car, but had a terrible dealer experience (in another state). I found the model I wanted, Premium black/black and test drove it. After getting multiple quotes I was able to reach a deal. The car is great. It's based on the Mercedes GLA 250, but I think the Infiniti looks much better. It handles extremely well and the twin turbo is plenty powerful with loads of torque at the low end. There are three drive modes, economy, sport and manual, which allows you to use the paddle shifters. It's quick and agile. The Bose Surround Sound is outstanding, the best sound system I've ever heard in a car. I love being able to see text messages on the screen (they are read to you while driving)  and the touch screen is excellent but I prefer to use the turn knob.

My wife thought it was a 6 cyl because the 4 cly with turbo had so much kick to it.  It goes!  Just got back from a 1,700 mile trip to DC and it caused me no fatigue at all.  My QX30 is fully loaded except 4 wheel drive.  I get about 25-27 in town and mid 30s on the highway. Wish the gas tank was a little bigger but filling up for under $25 works for me.  My only complaints are: 1) Clanky start noise that I hate, 2) Lack of surface space to place a mount for my cellphone, 3) Limited storage for coins, glasses, etc. , 4) Navigation needs more refinement, 5) I'm putting too many miles on it because I enjoy driving it.  My Loves: 1) I love all the options, Bose sound, self parking, adaptive cruse, BT, lane warning, radar and 360 cameras.    I just wish the auto stop/start was not there and that it would not clank when restarting.  That is my biggest complaint.

When car is in standard mode it really accelerates. It's a weird feeling walking up to this car because of it's low profile however, when you are driving it you still feel like you are driving an SUV. At first I wanted the dark grey car but saw the majestic white with beige and black leather interior and fell in love. The only things that still bother me are the button puss park. It still freaks me out. Also the back up camera sometimes turns black when your backing up. (it happened to me only about 5 or 6 times since I owned the car). I spoke with the Infinity Dealer about problem and they said it is a known issue with this car and are in the process of resolving it. Love the large premium tires too with beautiful dirt free trim. What else can I say about the Bose stereo and Speakers. Phenomenal! Bluetooth works great too. Dimming mirrors at night to take away that annoying one car who always seem to have his or her bights on. Adjustable seats a re wonderful and cater to small people as well as large. Great lumbar support! Nice beautiful cockpit with everything under the sun . Too much to even name.One thing is missing though. Where is the sunglass storage?

infiniti,qx30,2017,HeatherLea, 05/04/2017,Not for everyone & it's not an SUV,4,"First, I realize that this car (not SUV) is not for everyone. I was seeking to get out of my Mazda CX-9 because the fuel economy was not very good and it was just more vehicle then I needed.  The two big dogs were gone and the kids were older so  I decided it was time to simplify my life and do something for me.  I searched high and low for my next ride and was not interested in driving what everyone else was.  The QX30 is different.  It's compact and loaded with style.  The turbo charged 4 cyl has given me a new super powers...passing speed and the ability merge into traffic with zero effort.  The drivers seat is exceptionally comfortable and it is fun to drive.  Here are the CONs... there is no cargo space.  I can get one carry-on suitcase and a couple of grocery bags in there.  If you are taller than 5'9 and weigh more than you should :( this car will not be comfortable.   It really is a two seater and not suitable for a family.  My five year old and his car seat fit comfortably in the back but it won't work for him in a couple years.  The owner's manual has a hard time fitting into the glove box, my iPhone Plus does not fit anywhere including in the center console.  The infotainment system blows!  It's complicated and is confused when you plug in your phone or more than one person has Bluetooth on in the car.  The upside is that I am glad I took the plunge and I don't miss the extra cargo or seating.  I wish the infotainment system was better but it's not that big of a deal to me.  I like the compact styling because it is more effiecent and prevents me from buying anything that I cannot fit in the cargo space.   The lack of seating keeps people that I don't like out of my car.  Some people complain about the visabilty but if you have driven an SUV you are accustomed to poor visabilty.  I actually find it easier to see what's around me than in my old SUV.  Lastly, taking the plunge to a much smaller vehicle was made easier by the fact that it is leased.  It's fun for now but in a couple years I can try something else.  It's not a keeper by any stretch and reminds me of a modernized version of my 1969 Karmann Ghia which like the QX30 was fun only for a little while.
"
infiniti,qx30,2017,Steve M., 07/17/2018,Nice interior but drives like a Go Kart,2,"Overall just a poorly conceived and designed vehicle. The interior compartment is very nice and it actually got me to buy the car. While it is beautiful, after a few days it seemed like one of the most impractical cars I ever owned. Storage is awful, there is no place to store even sunglasses and the owners manual is too big to fit in the glove box (really?). Also hard to believe that there is no power hatch, only a manual option in a ""luxury"" car. Another problem, there is no way to have the doors unlock when you put the car in park. My 2008 Camry had this feature.  Also, the sight lines are awful as there is very low visibility out the rear and sides of this car. The glass panoramic roof is a must as it makes it feel less cramped but no where near as nice as a moonroof that actually opens. There is very little leg and headroom in the back for an average size adult. As far as the drive, it is very simply underpowered, and whines through the lower gears. This is not how I would expect a ""luxury"" car to drive. While sport mode does offer some nice performance, it really whines even more. Lastly, the road noise is horrendous, it sounds like something is open, the only relief is keeping the radio turned up. Handling was one of the few positives as long as you are on very smooth pavement as the ride is very stiff and you feel EVERY bump and expansion joint, even on the highway.  In closing, I disliked this vehicle so much that I returned it after 3 weeks and took the financial hit. Very disappointed.

There's a panoramic moonroof, but it doesn't open. Pickup is sluggish and electronic controls on the dashboard are difficult to reach and adjust, and there are several blindspots.

A great looking combination inside and out. As compared to the Z, it is a pleasure to drive. The road noise could be a bit better, but again, I came out of a Z, thus this is a significant upgrade in noise levels. Plus if all else fails, crank up the Bose, its awesome.

The dealer gave me a GX50--which made me wish for my piece of garbage (it was worse). My car is noisy. It works best in sport mode, but then the gas guzzling is at it's worst. I can't wait to give it back to the dealer.

infiniti,qx30,2017,Nana B, 02/15/2020,Full of regrets!,2,"I bought this car because I wanted a small, sporty car and I loved the rose gold color. The car is very stylish and the sport interior trim is nice. However the car is very small, and has had several problems since I purchased it 2 years ago. Repetitive problems with the coolant sensor and reservoir, brakes were jerking and needed repair, have already replaced the tires once. I’m so glad I have wan extended warranty, otherwise would have already spent  thousands of dollars and have only had a car for 2 years. I plan on trading it in the next year for an SUV.

The coolant sensor is ALWAYS on (they don’t know why), it goes through tires like nobody’s business (about to need new tires for the second time, they blame it on the fact it’s front wheel drive and the tires come with 60% less tread than a normal tire Due to its thin wall nature), the central $10,000 CPU system went bad after 2 years thankfully the warranty covered it, the gas tank access cover is automated And the switch went bad so I couldn’t close my gas tank.... etc. I love my car, but I’m  definitely  not buying it and would not suggest purchasing it.

infiniti,qx30,2017,Robert Kilburg, 03/13/2018,When a true sports sedan meets an SUV...,5,"...you get the QX 30. The perfect combination of all-wheel drive SUV performance and a nimble luxury sports car. This is no ""me too"" crossover. Once you slip in the cockpit and fire up the engine you'll know this technologically advanced alchemy of sure-footed-ski-trip sled and luxurious-razor-sharp-dressed-dart was not designed for wimps. It's sexy, smooth, powerful and poised in any driving situation - be it around the city or heading up to Tahoe. Add to that the fact you get incredible value and gas mileage even with the most loaded QX 30 trim package: you'll be glad you didn't overpay for a BMW or Mercedes.

I hear ever wind sound as if the window is open. There is little hatchback space. The arm rest is tiny. The glovebox only fits the manual.  The car auto locks and must be manually unlocked. It does do well on gas. I hate the sun view that doesn't open. I plan to take a financial loss after only 6 months to upgrade to a real luxury SUV.

infiniti,qx30,2017,James E., 11/07/2020,"It's not perfect, but close!",5,"I bought the 2017 QX30 this July with only 10,800 miles. It did take some getting use to, and at first I wondered if I had made a mistake. The transmission felt finicky, and the run-flat tires were awful--hard as a rock and loud. Did not like the ride at all. So after about 3 weeks, off came the run-flat Continentals and on went a set of traditional Generals (Altimax RT43), and I completely fell in love with the vehicle. Totally different riding experience! I also got used to the quirks of the transmission, so that's no longer an issue: I just use the default mode and don't mess with Sport or Manual. It has lots of power and gives excellent gas mileage: 31.5 highway and 26-27 combined. It's definitely small, but a small crossover is what I wanted. The driver and front passenger areas have ample room, just the back storage area that could be a little deeper. I've logged about 3,000 miles and couldn't be happier. This is a lot of car for the money.

infiniti,qx30,2018,Svnisus, 09/01/2018,Wish I Knew Then What I Know Now,3,"Please, please, please I BEG you before you purchase an Infiniti QX30 open the rear hatch and look to see if the left wiring harness is crushed. If so, please walk away. My brand new 2018 with only 70 miles was purchased on 6/16/18. Because the start/stop feature battery was dead I didn't actually take possession of the car until 6/26/18. During the first month of ownership I began having problems with the backup camera going black, navigation system flashing weird messages and the lights and radio not turning off after the car was turned off and the driver door was opened. When I took it in for service the dealership said these problems were because software needed to be updated, which they did. There was also a window gasket that needed to be replaced. That part was ordered and an appointment made two weeks out. This car came complete with a rear cargo cover which we didn't disconnect to vacuum the top of until approximately 5 weeks after purchasing it. After dropping it down we saw the left wiring harness was damaged. The next day I drove it to the dealership and was told they would order a new cover and replace it at my next already scheduled appointment. Upon returning for that appointment I was told they couldn't order just the harness cover, all the wires which control the whole car run through the harness and it was one complete part which would have to replaced. They quoted me a price of $11,000 and due to the cost they were going to have get approval from Infiniti beforehand since it would be covered under warranty. The dealership had given me another QX30 loaner to drive. I checked and that harness was completely intact. I then checked several others on the lot and found 4 out of 6 were compromised, one to the point the VIN number tag located above the left harness had been pushed up and out of place.  Infiniti refused to replace the wiring harness. I then contacted Infiniti Consumer Affairs, they opened a case and said a regional manager would contact me. After speaking to the regional manager, again my request to have the problem corrected was denied. I was told it was a design defect and yes, the wires were being pinched but there wasn't any sense in replacing it since I hadn't really hadn't had any major problems because the next one installed would just do the same thing. I explained I was concerned about both electrical failure and since I keep cars for a very long time, what would happen if these electrical problems didn't occur until after the warranty expired. I was told there was nothing they could do. I then asked to speak to someone over the regional manager and was told there wasn't anyone else that dealt with the public. I then called Consumer Affairs back, explained I wasn't happy with the situation, asked again to speak to someone else and was again told there wasn't anyone else to talk to. This morning the car was in reverse and once again the backup camera went to black. I emailed the service adviser to schedule yet another appointment to have the car looked at. I firmly believe it is all tied to the design defect causing the wiring inside the harness to be compromised and Infiniti refuses to take responsibility for the problem.
"
infiniti,qx30,2018,Sy, 01/02/2019,An underrated car that saved my life!,5,"This is our first ""entry"" sort of vehicle and it feels anything but. We brought a fully loaded red QX30S in red and is stunning! I've noticed that the lease deals are great on this car but I always keep my cars for 10+ years so I don't lease but you might want to look into it. I would not recommend this car as a main car if you have a family with young kids I would recommend a bigger SUV, but  I would definitely recommend it as a weekend or a smaller daily driver. Having many cars I needed something daily driveable and practical with more space but having that fun factor this was the final decision. I test drove the Range Rover Sport V8 and was about to get but the screens did not turn on during the test drive which was an automatic turn off, test drove the Cayenne and it was fun but kind of too big, Macan GTS and was fun but small, the GLC 43 SUV and Coupe we’re not impressive in the slightest(also my friend is having nightmares with hers). After realizing how much I loved my G sedan I decided to look at Infiniti and the new QX50 but that was first model year and no, so I saw this car in the parking lot and I fell in love. I brought it and have no buyers remorse. I have only seen one of these on the road in the 5 months we've had it but it is a huge head turner, especially because of the beautiful red pearl paint. We surprisingly get compliments on it all the time. The Sport trim comes with every option besides the adaptive cruise and that is ok because this car is easy and fun to drive anyways so it is not needed. We have always had powerful W12, V8, and V6 engines so we were extremely skeptical about coming to a turbo 4 but this car flies! Having a G35 alongside this car, I do not feel it is underpowered, it zips and is great in the city or highway, there are no problems passing cars at 80+mph. Even though we got sport model, the ride quality is not harsh, and handles great but you can feel the bumps a little more than higher luxury cars. I thought getting a FWD car would be a mistake but in the Florida rain, it handles well and feels safe. We always leave it in Eco mode because in sport mode it holds out the gears and makes me want to accelerate more but the dual clutch transmission is great! It has expensive feeling(compared to RDX) paddle shifters but  it is always in the right gear. The only CON I have to this vehicle is the Auto-start stop system because sometimes if you come to a stop and your foot is not all the way down the brake pedal you will be stopped but the car stays in second gear and when you press the brake pedal all the way down it roughly shifts into first and cuts off the engine but it restarts fine, it has only happened a couple times but I still turn off the auto start-stop everytime I get in the car because the gas mileage is great anyways. In terrible rush hour(bumper to bumper for an hours on I-4/I-275), I usually get 24-26 mpg but on stretches, I get easily 31 MPG which I was impressed by. This car does have a small gas tank though so that is something I do not like but it is fine. The storage space is not terrible and the interior room is surprisingly roomy especially with my tall family.I was worried it would be too small but everyone is comfy we just lower the seats when driving and it still gives the SUV ""commanding driving position"" feel.  The cargo space is plenty for the Costco runs as well. Finally: The features in this car are plentiful and surprising for the price. Full LED w/ swiveling and fogs is a great feature for night drivers, pano roof makes the cabin feel open and airy(it doesn't open which I do not care about but some people do), the parking features are helpful, the 360 camera, parking sensors, and self-park system are all useful, especially perpendicular parking assist,this car will do it! The navigation system is great and the live traffic is good, Bluetooth connects
 automatically with phone everytime I start the car. The Bose surround sound is pretty good. The seats(specific to sport model) are lovely and wow first timers too. They are black leather w/white sides&contrast stitching and suede inserts which provide amazing comfort when stuck in traffic. I spent months trying to decide on a car and finally came to this and I am extremely happy; UPDATE: 3k miles I love the car, only pano roof shade needed replacing under warranty free 1st mainUPDATE: 6k miles: no problems and still turns heads;wish gas tank was larger for city driving,but I’m just nit picking get one while you can! They discontinued them, why? Beats me... UPDATE: 7.5k miles; Long trips great except small tank but cruising at 90 for 200 miles no prob; was in shop for 1 month to fix strut; all under warranty but took a month which was annoying; this car is extremely safe; it has knee airbags and on impact of accident protects your ears with a sound. This car saved my life I’m extremely thankful but unfortunately it was totaled. Such a beautiful car but with that accident, thankful to be alive.

infiniti,qx30,2018,Lynn, 01/10/2018,Infiniti is like family to me,3,"This QX30 model has a major design flaw.  When driving with A/C on, every couple of minutes it blows hot air then reverts back to cool air.  I have noticed this even when driving it with vents only,no A/C.  I bought this car cause I liked the look, size and handling and its adequate cargo space.  I would have preferred a hybrid but settled for a known commodity.  It hasn't gotten more than 25 MPG but it was advertised at 31 on their sales sticker.  It didn't come with ""heat seats""or lane protection and there is no automatic lift gate opener either in the car or under the back bumper.  It has had a rattle since I bought it - interior - its been checked on three occasions at the Infiniti service repair and they cannot find the source of the rattle.  Aggravating.  The sun room is really a moon roof, it doesn't open to allow fresh air into the car.  I am not as enthralled with the car as I was when I bought it in Nov. 2017.

I bought this car because I needed its safety features that few other cars have at this time.  I specifically love the blind spot warning and parking sensors, plus the 360 degree live view.  The self-parking feature was a requirement for me, and it works great!  It takes corners nicely and holds the road.  Negatives are:  loud engine, poor placement of some of the controls (very hard to see and to reach while driving), not enough USB ports, voice controls don't that respond well enough to my commands,  no onboard computer to store my music, and it's disappointingly small.  The price is exceptionally high, and the gas mileage is not great.  Overall, I'm happy with the vehicle, but wish I would have noticed some of the negatives before purchasing.

infiniti,qx30,2018,TW in Iowa, 08/14/2018,Loving our QX30 Premium more than our G37x Coupe!,4,"Love the unique look and sexy / sporty styling of the QX30 and that in 2 plus months of ownership we haven't seen another one on the road.  Having a Full Sized Toyota Sequoia and a Mid sized Nissan Murano as daily drivers, we have driven Infiniti Coupes (G35, G37x, Q60x) as our weekend fun car the past 10 plus years. After a considerable search for our 3rd stall garage fun car, we pulled the trigger on a new 2018 QX30 Premium Crossover loaded with every option. We LOVE it and my wife is now driving it daily and her Murano sits in the garage. :-) She's averaging 25 mpg on her daily commute of 50-50 freeway / town. We've seen 30 mpg on two 300 mile weekend road trips. We embrace the size / dimensions as it offers so much more than our Coupes. Getting in / out is much easier and our dog can hop in the back as well. If your expecting to tote the family around or take several co workers to lunch... you'd better buy a larger SUV.  Hands down the ride quality and the AMAZING 2.0 motor / 7 speed dual clutch trans, impressed us enough to buy it.  Super strong 258 ft lbs of torque at just 1250 RPM, and you'll enjoy zippy guilt free starts as just 1/3 throttle puts you a block down the road while other cars are just crossing the intersection. Near triple digit speeds on entrance ramps are possible. Ride quality was better than Lexus nx200t, nissan Rogue SL, Toyota Rav4 Limited, Honda CRV Touring we also test drove. Assisted Parking is amazing and not only parallel parks but also backs into tight parking spots as well. All you do is monitor the brake and the car steers itself! Sound system is superb, memory seats for both driver and passenger etc. are all top notch. As for handling, it delivers sports car like cornering and a much smoother overall ride. We thought we might miss our 330 hp Infiniti coupes but the QX30 is like a sports sedan on steroids with higher seating, 4 doors, lift gate cargo area, and overall unique and sporty appearance.  The adaptive LED headlights are awesome in that they turn with the steering wheel, and auto high beam took all of about 1 minute to appreciate. As with any new car, there is a learning curve with controls and buttons, and even being the Mercedes influence such as seat position knobs on the door panel, the QX30 has been very easy to learn to navigate all the functions / screens. A few small complaints like having to hold the memory seat button instead of just touch it and placing the steering wheel volume on the right side wouldn't stop us from buying it again. We got an amazing low price and scored the 7 yr 100K wrap warranty for about 1/2 the asking price from a Chicago Infiniti dealer. There are 3 dealers in Chicago, so the competition is a good thing for the consumer! Just 1500 miles on the odometer and we are loving our QX30!

infiniti,qx30,2018,Portdriver, 01/08/2019,"A very nice ""personal"" utility vehicle",4,"I like this car very much. When I first got this it, I thought the economy setting on the transmission mode was too slow, but now I always use it and just jump on the paddle shifters if i want truly sporty driving. I do like the front seats - a lot - but this is NOT a big car. I am 5' 10"" 180 pounds, and it fits me perfectly. I knew I fit before I purchased it, so I am perplexed by people who have purchased it, but then say it's too small. The back seat is only good for short trips, unless your passengers are average size or less - but, again - I knew this when I bought it. Cargo room is fine, the glass roof has a nice retractable screen (yes, I wish it opened), and the roof rails allows for real, sturdy roof racks - which I use. After years of my wife having to drive large SUVs for the kids, she is now thrilled to have a sporty, AWD vehicle with just enough utility, and a lot more fun.

Don’t have to over reach for controls, and I feel like I’m in a cockpit. I have the Sport model, so it’s loaded - Nav, Handsfree, Awesome detailing in the interior. I had driven a Nissan Rogue for years which handled my Mom Duties like a pro, but I was ready for something a bit more fun and this car delivers! It’s zippy, tight handling, but I find the seats very comfortable especially with the adjustable lumbar support. I love my panoramic roof (this doesn’t open - just a giant glass ceiling), this makes the car feel roomier. I can see out of this car better than the Rogue so I don’t feel like my view is impeded...and the blind spot monitor is very sensitive. The gas mileage is the same as my Rogue. I live in an area that I drive 50 mph on average, so this car loves to gets up and go!  With the back seats down, I can get a small coffee table and end table in. (Tried it, so I know!). My golf clubs fit snugly in the trunk with the seats up.

If you’re looking for something fun, looks incredibly sharp (even the car wash attendant told me “Nice Wheels!” today), great sound system, and well made then this car is for you!"
infiniti,qx30,2018,Finito123, 02/24/2020,What was I thinking...,2,"I bought the 2018 Infiniti QX30 on a whim because I thought it was fun, fast and sporty looking, and the ink blue looked pretty sweet.  None of those were good reasons to buy a brand new $34K car when I was going to be putting 80 miles / day on it as a daily driver.  Fast forward 2 years and 43K miles:  We try to put a baby carseat in the back - it fit, but only if the front passenger has their knees jammed (literally) into the dashboard.  The stroller fit in the trunk, but took up ALL of the cargo space, so good luck if you need to get groceries.  The paint scratches if you look at it funny (I got suckered into an extended warranty that, surprisingly, didn't cover it when the technician who applied the ""protective coating"" must have done so with a rough cloth because I had many spiderweb scratches from there on out).  The transmission is clunky/jerky, not very good at low speeds or stop and go traffic.  Gas mileage is decent at 23 mpg, but requires 93 premium gasoline, which even in this economy is always well over $3 a gallon.  The cabin space itself feels cramped, and there is no place to put anything unless it is a standard issue bottle of water.  There is a change compartment where the USB and power outlets are, 2 small cupholders, and a teeny console, also a very small glove box.  The worst is that there is no place to put your sunglasses up by the rearview mirror!  Finally, the ""sporty suspension"" creates a bumpy ride and super loud road noise.  It comes as no surprise that Infiniti dropped production of the QX30 in mid-2019.  They should really just issue a refund to those who purchased.  I just traded mine in to go back to a CR-V and it is the BEST.

Even the exhaust looks like Mercedes.  I owned the Infiniti FX35 for nearly 10 years and miss is so.  I doubt that I will own this car for 6 months.  The QX30 handles ok but the instrument panel is crap and not easily accessible.  The cargo space is very limited and for all that money you dont even get a power lift gate.  So glad the kids are out of the house as the back seat is really small.  So no, if your expecting traditional Infiniti maybe save your money and get the QX50.

The good news is that even though the car was totaled and all airbags were deployed, my son walked away without a scratch. I was surprised that the windshield did not crack. When I drove this car, I would say that I can only think of two drawbacks. It does not have a very tight turning radius. For example I had a Volvo V50 station wagon for many years where you could make a hairpin turn in the smallest of spaces. Second, the designers of this car must have not taken into consideration that some women buy cars like this one. The brake pedal is the only brake pedal in a car that I have driven where my foot could not rest of the floor and have the ball of my foot on the break. The brake pedal is positioned higher than in any other car I've driven...in other words, it was designed for a large foot. It was incredibly reliable and the seats are amazingly comfortable. It is hard to find a car with seats as comfortable as this car. Love this car.

infiniti,qx50,2014,Jeff, 12/11/2019,My favorite vehicle,5,"So far, I’ve had this car for 5 1/2 years, and it’s been very good to me. The drawbacks...

1. Tight turning radius
2. Nicks in the leather (it’s so supple, that it wears easily - corners of drivers seat have torn from standard use - issue began after only about 1 year)
3. Interior space - much smaller inside than similar vehicles. The hatch is tiny.
4. Blue tooth technology - updates to apple’s compression algorithms continue to make the music features on the phone obsolete via Bluetooth - have to keep taking car into dealership for updates 

But...

Great handling car. Powerful engine. Mileage isn’t awful (21.4 mpg after 85,000 miles). Even though the technology is 6 years old at this point, it still works well. Very comfortable ride. Reasonably well insulated from road noise. Quiet engine unless you juice it...in which case it has a nice guttural roar. Would definitely consider replacing this with a new edition when I buy my next vehicle.

It is everything I wanted -- comfortable, quick, intuitive and fun to drive.  I don't carry passengers much, so can't attest to the rear seat comfort but my dog loves the back and the fact that she can stick her nose out the rear window without having to put her front legs on the door frame.  We're both happy campers.

infiniti,qx50,2014,larryhat1, 03/28/2014,Initial Disappointment,3,"I have had my QX50 for a little over a week now.
I had looked at so many cars that I more than likely rushed to judgement in buying this vehicle.
My problem is, it was a cold day when I test drove the car and did not notice some things that I have grown to take for granite on a $40,000 plus car.
As an example: 1 touch windows up/down, Ventilated seats, no seat lumbar adjustment, 1 touch moon/sun roof, and I just found out that Nissan doesn't even make a cargo net for it.
Nor does this model have blind spot indicators or adaptive cruise control which our $25k Altima had."
infiniti,qx50,2015,S Scranton, 11/02/2015,Great car with a couple problems,4,"I have owned and loved my previous G35 Infiniti for several years and many other vehicles that were high and medium end vehicles. This is a great car but it has a couple engineering flaws that even Infiniti acknowledges.  The first and most important is the outside temperature reporting.  It's always wrong!  Infiniti knows that the problem in placement of the temperature sensor next to the radiator.  So, why not fix it? The outside temperature then drives the automatic temperature control in the vehicle.  Another problem is blind side visibility.  It's addressed with an add-on package at the factory, but cannot be added once you take delivery.  Not to be a Scrooge, this vehicle deserves justice for the facile buggy it is.  Fast, fun to drive, responsive and it has substantial room for luggage, garden equipment/supplies and dog cage used for our trips to the park.  I'd buy it again, but engineering needs fine tuning, as alluded to above.
Comment after 1 year: The new buyer comment is still on the money.  Great car with above caveats.

I  enjoy the smooth transmission and the added power of the 3.7 and quietness of the engine over the turbo noise in other small suv's.  Handling is sharp and gives a good feel of the road.  On highway the road noise is much lower than I experienced in other brands (especially the Honda CRV).

infiniti,qx50,2016,Jay Deubel, 04/30/2016,Very happy with this 2016 QX50,5,"This is a sports car masked as a crossover or smaller SUV. It handles like my former BMW 335i coupe, but with much more room. The technology is very good, with an amazing camera system named Birdseye view. You can see entirely around the car and when you pull into a parking space you can simply push the camera button and see everything around you, including what's in front of you. The interior is very upscale and the technology is simple to learn. It is much easier that my former BMW and the Mercedes E350 that we currently own. Everything works great including Bluetooth, navigation, phone, voice control and temp control. The gas mileage is not great at about 21 mixed and 24 to 25 on the highway, however, we were looking for performance with luxury options, not an underpowered vehicle with a boxy appearance. This vehicle has styling and turns heads with a flashy dual exhaust and a throaty yet refined sound when you start out or get on it. 0 to 60 is in the low 5's, and passing gear is smooth and powerful. Inside is spacious, especially the back seat with the added space, new in 2016. We are very pleased so far and by reading reviews, we expect maintenance costs to be very low. Lastly, a deeper center console box is needed along with a USB port on the dash instead of in the center console box.
"
infiniti,qx50,2016,Penelope Quintero, 03/11/2016,Great Crossover,4,"We were looking for a vehicle that we could keep for many years. Looked and drove MANY crossovers. In the end, we really liked the known reliability and power of the VQ engine. The crossover drives like a fast car, I have no problem passing cars at high speeds and it gets up to speed effortless when entering the freeway. The seats are very comfortable and the interior has more of a ""classic"" feel to it. Electronics are average, nothing out of the ordinary. Technology is great, parking with the 360 cameras makes the job much easier while having the front sensing brakes gives you peace of mind. At around 10mph, we had a child jump in front of the car unexpectedly and the vehicle stopped automatically. Can not speak of reliability yet but required maintenance mainly includes basic oil changes every 6months and brake flush every 2 years. There are many different options out there but we chose this crossover because of the sporty way it drives, the known VQ engine, and the options it has for the price. We are very happy and will considered buying an Infiniti again in the future. 3.24.17 Update: The only downfall is that the AC developed a wet dirty rag smell like mold. I took it in and they told me there was nothing wrong but they had cleaned it and put some smelly thing on it. It only masked the musty smell but did not fix it. They suggested I turn off the a/c and let the vent blow just air to dry the vents as this sometimes happens. We did research and apparently other people were having the same problem. I don't think it's reasonable to ask me to do something special with the A/C for it to work appropriately especially on very hot days when I really need the A/c to work properly. It's embarrassing to have people in the car when I have to turn it on because of the smell. Besides this though the car is great.
"
infiniti,qx50,2016,John E., 04/22/2016,Excellent Value,5,"I'm relatively new to Infiniti/Nissan.  My first Infiniti was a Q50 that I REALLY enjoyed driving.  It was quiet (except for the growl during start up and acceleration), incredibly fast, and it looked like a James Bond escape vehicle.  For my lifestyle, however, it wasn't very practical as I kayak 4 days a week.  Trading off between my Jeep was getting a bit much.  I wanted to capture a similar driving experience in an SUV.  Considering all vehicle makes, I went back to Infiniti for the QX50.  It shares the same 3.7 liter V-6 as the Q60 which I loved, has a rack and the ability to store items in the back.   Where the Q60 would jump off the line, the QX50 has a more subtle acceleration.  The QX50 will perform when you want it to, though - both in acceleration and handling. The QX50 is also much easier to get in and out of the cockpit of the Q60.    

If you want a sports car, but your life demands an SUV, the QX50 is a very solid choice.
"
infiniti,qx50,2016,bill p, 07/25/2016,A sports car marketed as an SUV,5,"This is a great car priced thousands below the competition. This is our third EX/QX50, and we bought this one for the technology package, and the extra 4 inches in length. The car has not disappointed. You are essentially getting the equivalent of  a fully equipped Porsche Macan at essentially half the price. The 0-60 time is just short of the Porsche Cayman. The reviewers are critical of the cramped cabin, outside visibility, dated interior styling and the package pricing. To them I say do they criticize Porsche over a cramped cabin and outside visibility? Have they ever attempted to build a Porsche online, where seemingly even the steering wheel is extra? Package pricing should be a welcome addition. To me simple is better, and that includes the interior styling and lack of complexity. In the QX50, you can actually turn on the radio, and change the volume and the station with one push of the button - how novel. And in comparison with the same class of vehicle, where is the consideration of cost and reliability? This car is not perfect. It now needs a power lift gate and better fuel economy, and the Navigation System needs to work better. We use our $400 Garmin Nuvi instead of the Nav. Also, the power rear seats are a joke. But, all in all, a great car, which we would/and have bought again in a heartbeat. Somehow, Nissan, having been in this segment since the beginning, has not marketed this vehicle correctly, and that is a shame. We’ve since acquired a 2017 which had to be ordered from Japan because the specific color and packages were not available.

infiniti,qx50,2016,Elizabeth Matthews, 02/24/2016,I LOVE this car! Infiniti has another winner!,5,"I had three Infiniti sedans before, and decided to get a Mercedes C300 AWD just to change things up...well, after 25,000 miles I couldn't wait to get rid of the Mercedes and get back to Infiniti. There were so many things the Mercedes didn't have that Infiniti did--and I am loving this crossover type! It's as fun to drive as the G37X sedans were but it has so much more room inside, and I enjoy sitting up a bit higher.

Two years later:
I still love this car!!!!! I wouldn't change a thing!
"
infiniti,qx50,2016,LQQX50, 11/26/2019,370Z with a Rear Seat & 4 Doors,5,"In a world of ever increasing gutless FWD based ""cross-over looking "" economy cars flooding the marketplace, the RWD based QX50 is a breathtaking punch in the gut of naturally aspirated fresh air.  

While most ""professional"" reviewers will call the EX 35 / EX37 / QX50 aged, dated, stale, tired, long in the tooth, etc....  
This Vehicle really is the true pioneer of the explosive crossover segment that is now dominating the automotive street-scape.  

A decade ahead of its time, the QX50 has the Heart, Soul, Bones, Motor, Platform, Power, and over all Essence of the honored Nissan Z car heritage in a functional everyday package.  This is a common theme amongst all the reviews here because it's true. 

The 3.7 V6 gets it done, and quickly.  Segment busting with it's whopping 325 HP, the QX50 is a pure blast to drive.

When talking about the '16 & '17 model years, all the automotive press  gloats about is the added 4 inches of leg room and 3.2 inches of stretched wheelbase. They all forget to mention that the QX50 smoked the competition in 2016 & 2017; and quite frankly, even smokes the latest incarnation of the 2019 + QX50.

So we all know it's sporty and powerful; there are some criticisms to offer if we need to get overly critical.

Some say it looks like a ""clown shoe"". However, to me, it looks like a hot retro quality built Japanese styled shooting brake.
A functional sport coupe with the added convenience of a rear doors and auto fold down up rear seats.  

Some say the technology is dated.  It has all around cameras standard, not many other new CUVs do.  

The 2016's newer grille is an improvement over the '08 to '15 grille for sure, however, it's almost as if Infiniti tried ""too hard"" to make it look more mainstream crossover as it is bit busy with LED DTR lights and the Silver Accents on the lower facia. A lot is going on there.

The QX50 could be quieter inside, but then again, it's a rush to hear the 3.7 doing it's thing, so it's a tradeoff that is livable.

The Bridgestone Protenza Tires on the new '19 inch Touring Package Wheels are noisy, and a bit narrow.
This is something the can be upgraded when they wear out. 

It lacks a power tail gate. 

The touchscreen is smaller by today's standards, but is simple, easy to operate, and rather intuitive.

Short of the Porsche Macan, The pre-2019 QX50 IS THE CUV to covet !
Priced right. 
Impressive Performance. 
Terrific Handling.
Smooth Shifting. ( Sport Mode is fun for longer revs, Manual Mode too if you're so inclined, no paddle shifters, but thats OK ) 
Quality Built in Japan with tight fit and finishes. 
It's so Luxurious, Sporty, Comfortable, Nimble, yet Brutish to drive.

Standard Stuff Galore: 
Real Leather. ( still smells new and of a quality leather too ) 
Standard Moon Roof. ( Larger Panoramic Glass Top would be nice ) 
Standard Power Folding - both up and down - Rear Seats. 
Standard Heated Front Seats.

Other Observations / Features / Likes - Etc. 
The Bose Sound System really cranks out the tunes.
AWD models are rear wheel biased until the front traction is needed.
Excellent color choices, the metallics are deep and brilliant. ( I have Malbec Black which has a subtle deep plum metallic to it )
Just the right amount of Chrome in all the right places to give it a Luxury Vibe.

I shopped every used AWD Vehicle in the Mid $20,000 range.
The QX50 outdid the competition on so many levels.
Was lucky to find a used unit with super low miles, just 6,800. 
My '16 had a MSRP of $44,000 when new - 3 yrs later was able to purchase at $24,500
Nothing this nice, this powerful, this optioned, in a car, truck, CUV, or SUV, came anywhere as close to the value gotten.

I had a Nissan 2003 350Z for 8  years and drove it for 100,000 miles.
This QX50 is every bit as thrilling to drive, and excites just the same with every start up and trip taken.
Now I can take more that 1 passenger,
 drive in Ice and Snow, haul more stuff, and still grin ear to ear.

The EX35 / EX37 / QX50 is the REAL Deal
The True Pioneer of the CUV Movement 
The Godfather that Started this Whole Sensational Crossover Craze to begin with !

Don't settle for less. Don't overpay for less.

Drove the BMW X1 and was completely underwhelmed.  This handles better and felt faster - no comparison on the interior......BMW felt cheap.

infiniti,qx50,2016,Jeff, 12/29/2016,Its Just OK,4,"I came out of an Acura RDX and truth be told, this car has it all over the Acura which was cheap all the way. The QX50 is small, so small that you cannot fit two coffee cups in the cup holder at the same time. Size aside its relatively comfortable on trips, the mileage is ok and it drives well, plenty of power and the handling is a strong point. Had it for part of a winter and its pretty good in the snow. Now for the down side: The blue tooth is poor. We have iPhone 6s and the integration is not good at all. If you google this issue with infiniti there are pages and pages of complaints about problems with iPhone integration. Given that there a billion iphones out there, pretty strange. In addition, the voice transmission is poor, very noisy even when you have 4 or 5 bars.  The GPS is adequate at best and frustrating at times, to the point where I use my phone and google maps. No data available in addresses that come up in the search menu, that sort of thing, if you abbreviate street or avenue, sometimes it works, sometimes you have to spell out the word, again, not what you expect from a car that touts itself as a luxury suv. Again, its an OK car but, the devil is in the detail and Infiniti needs to work on some of the amenity type things that get under peoples skin. The price was right, the dealer did a good job preparing the car and they treat you very well when you return for service with free loaners etc. All in all, its fine but, some issues for sure

infiniti,qx50,2016,Lee, 07/31/2016,A Sleeper of an SUV,5,"Considered all the competition but came back to the 2016 Infiniti QX50.  Wanted a strong V6 not a turbo 4 banger (Long Term Reliability!).  Seems many are complaining about gas mileage.  With just 2,500  miles I am able to get around 16 MPG in town and a solid 26.5 MPG on the highway.  Achieved a high of 28.2 MPG on a recent trip.  I am using lighter Mobil 1 5W-20 so this may help slightly in the mileage.  Great vehicle and value.  My regrets is lack of an auto lift gate on the rear also lack of Apple or Android Auto.

Not the best gas mileage, but that's to be expected with this kind of performance.  (The newer QX50 models have a 4 cylinder engine with CVT transmission which I did not like at all.)  The interior is nice looking and roomy -- very comfortable leather seats.   This is the first time I have ever leased a car, and would buy it at the end of my lease (which is coming up), but the residual price is too high!  I have seen this same car for sale at a lower price.  Infiniti will not do anything to encourage me to buy this car so I will just turn it in in a couple of months.  Boo!!!

infiniti,qx50,2016,Honey Badger, 05/11/2016,Great sporty crossover,5,"I was looking for something very specific: the utility of a crossover (not necessarily luxury) while maintaining the sporty quality that makes me happy in daily driving. To get sportier in this segment, you would have to move to the Porsche Macan or the Mercedes GLA 450 AMG, neither anywhere near my budget. For the money, this is the best deal out there, given the specifics I was looking for. Some specific details below.
- The expected good: Powerful engine, faster linear acceleration than my previous GTI. I pull out of traffic stops faster than most cars, without really trying; Nice interior feel, comfortable and understated luxury; the AWD is fantastic, the rear wheel traction makes for great handling on dry road, and in rain or snow it makes it easy to drive with minimal adaptation. It feels like you can throw anything at it, and you can take the car anywhere. 
- The better than expected good: the 360 view camera and the navigation were pleasant surprises, after review complaints about the design being outdated; A ton of room in the rear seats, makes for nice comments from any passengers you take along; Infiniti customer service is so far superb! The dealer over-inflated the tires (actually forgot to lower the pressure after delivery), which, combined with new owner paranoia, made me worried about long term effect on suspensions after driving on it. After just one email, Infiniti promptly extended the suspension, direction and breaks warranty, no questions asked, and followed up to make sure I was happy. Nice change from the VW customer service…
- The expected bad: fuel economy is poor, if you drive it in a sporty manner. The V6 begs you to do just that, and expresses its satisfaction nicely with a lively low grunt. I expected this, and can live with it; the Bose sound system: the greatest scam in consumer electronics. I know a lot of people will disagree, because TV said Bose is good, and most people cannot tell the difference between good audio and bloated midrange that distorts well-recorded music and dupes 95% of the population into thinking ""it sounds good"".
- The unexpected bad: less storage space and room around the driver than my much smaller GTI! I adapted to it though; The thing with the overinflated tires on delivery (see above) took some of the new car elation away, but both Infiniti and the dealership have been very prompt to address it. 
Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. I miss some of the fast turning of a sports hatchback, but the peace of mind driving in any condition, the comfort, satisfying acceleration and smooth highway performance make me forget I'm in an SUV instead of a sporty car. The price makes this car an excellent deal, as all the competitors in this ""luxury"" small SUV/crossover segment are all both pricier and less athletic! If I were to do it again, I may spring for the extra cost of the Journey package to get the larger wheels, for an even better handling. 6 cylinder rear-biased vehicles are on the way out, and I am happy I managed to get one of these before they disappear.

When I went to release my next car I would have taken an QX70 hands down.  I test drove the QX50 and it is very quick on acceleration but wasn't thrilled with the title comments. The longer I drive it the more those 2 things bother me. I feel like I am falling off the seat and I have only a 32"" inseam. I can't imagine if I was taller!  The value proposition is poor compared to the others in the segment except for the power and acceleration. The programs changed at Infinity even though the MSRP went up only 2,500 the Monthly payment would have increased 150 per month! Currently  I am in a 2016 QX50 for $75 more per month than I was paying for the FX even though the MSRP is about 8,000 less.   I can't wait for this lease to be up so I can go into one of the competitors for the same money or less.  Lesson learned don't take a car that is quick without kicking the tires.

- Except the audio system (what is it good for if you cannot connect the music of your phone into the car?), the technology in this car sucks. The voice recognition is slow and unless you pay 2000 for the premium plus package it only works to make phone calls.

Just to simply drive to work/home you cannot observe current traffic, so I'm stuck using Google Maps or Waze on my phone after spending nearly $2k for navigation.  You can't get Bluetooth without the navigation pkg.,  and you must have a Sirius XM package for the system to work, again this is archaic.  Only 1 USB port, and all information is in a list which is incredibly unsafe & a huge distraction so you can't use it while driving.  The directional compass is a tiny arrow, you never know what direction is N,W, S or E without searching while driving for the arrow.  There is no power button for the trunk, there are no cup/bottle holders in the doors and the duel cup holders in the center console are too small for more than one cup at a time and it blocks the gear shift!

infiniti,qx50,2017,Dave, 06/20/2018,"Two Years, 52k miles and just getting started",5,"Sleeper sport sedan in a compact SUV body. Better than expected mileage on highway, expected mileage around town. I drive alot and the seats are awesome! Seat heater gets so hot, you can’t keep it on high!  Handles great, excellent feel for road, all controls and seats still feel like new inside. Still in original set of tires, upkeep is nothing(oil change at dealer is $42, Used to pay $85 almost 13 yrs ago for my Audi!) Not a single repair yet or recall.  Fit teenagers and adults in back seat no problem. Cargo storage small but it has been fine for all my needs. Only downsides (cupholders small and the technology  phone voice dial is antiquated). That being said the blue tooth connects great and the mic is super clear. Never any complaints from people on quality of hearing me on calls. Car was manufactured in Japan, have no reason to believe this car won’t make it to 200k miles with very little trouble!"
infiniti,qx50,2017,john, 05/10/2017,My Infiniti,5,"Our family needed a SUV, I searched from internet got a lot of quotes but none of them really reached my attention. Then I saw the QX50, I looked at the car reviews and they said they were pretty good. So I went to the Infiniti dealer and test drove it. It was amazing, It was fast, smooth and drives excellent! The dealer gave me a excellent cheap price that was below my budget so I bought it. My wife and kids love it and so do I. I put 7k miles and it's been a year and so far so good with no problems. I would recommend this for families that are looking for a cheap luxe crossover.

infiniti,qx50,2017,In-fan-iti, 11/30/2017,More SSUH Than SUV,5,"I consider this a good point as it gives me lots of flexibility, and i don't need a large vehicle with massive cargo. It is still an unusual vehicle, and knowing the gas consumption, you are silly to buy it if that is a primary concern. I know in the past I have gotten better than rated mileage on this particular engine/setup (3.7L, 7 speed auto) as it has been very responsive with a feather touch on the gas, and I have a lead foot. I call it more a Sport Sedan Utility Hatchback, than a full fledged SUV. Remember hatchbacks? They had a higher cargo area you could expand if you needed to haul things around that were odd sizes, like a bicycle. the cargo area is a really good size by my standards, but smaller than some I have seen, but you could still carry quite a bit. As far as the packages, which were mentioned in the Edmunds review, they come pretty well loaded for a $35,000 SUV (the base, RWD model). I added the premium and premium plus packages for the upgraded radio, navigation, and several other features. The premium Pkg is $500, the Premium Plus is $1,000, but requires the Premium Package. I also got, just because it was closest to what I wanted, the 19"" wheel package for $800. Pretty cheap as far as packages go. The babysitting tools and other things I had no interest in are in the Technology Package, which has an awful lot of stuff in it for $2,000, including all the babysitting tools. That covers ALL the packages offered. The only other things are little accessories (most you won't need), and of course I wanted AWD. As far as the engine, I would gladly take the V-6 over many of the turbocharged competitors, and it happens to be a very reliable V-6 at that. I will be extremely sad to see it go from most infiniti vehicles in place of turbocharging, and the totally new engine for 2019 for this car. I sat in the back seat to try it out, and pushed the front seat farther back than I usually use it (I am 5'9"") and found the rear seat not a bad place to be for two adults (I would not ever put an adult in the middle because of the hump in the floor for the drivetrain), but the back seat has it own heat vents (under the seat) and a/c vents that can be turned off and adjusted (back of the center console). I actually found the navigation really easy to use and input addresses, as well as to control other settings for the car. And I LOVE that the Radio and climate controls are separate (though you can also use the unit for the radio or the steering wheel.  As far as bluetooth, yes, it does work for voice and for audio media, you just need to make sure it is set for both, otherwise it will only search for voice bluetooth systems. As far as driving, as I said before, there is tons of power, a sport driving mode, and manual shift on the stick, not on the wheel. Personally, considering how little I shift an automatic manually, they are more a hindrance than help on the wheel. I don't think it matters for everyday driving, but I have AWD. I have taken corners faster than I probably should have given it is a slightly higher center of gravity, and it drives very well on curvy roads as well as the highway. Since it is not the fastest selling of Infiniti's vehicles, you can often get a great deal on them, and unless you need more room than a compact vehicle will provide (again, remember it is compact) will provide or fuel economy is a huge priority for you, I say definitely test it and buy it if it suits your needs. Infiniti dealers are giving darned good discounts. I would say, depending on level of equipment (they max out around $45,000 MSRP), you can save $5,000 to $8,000 off sticker without much haggling. I saved $7,000, plus got an infiniti Loyalty Rebate good for another (I think) $1,000, and i really did not haggle.... I picked a car, and the saleswoman went and came back with the best price, then added the rebate, and I said great.
  So keep that in mind when comparing ""sticker prices""... they will come down on them quite a bit especially now while they still have 2017 on lot and know 2018 is last year before major changes.

"
infiniti,qx50,2017,Doobster6, 10/01/2020,Amalgamated old-school Perfection,5,"Just bought the last year model (2017) of the J50 version of the QX50. Fully loaded with under 33k miles. The J50 chassis is fundamentally a RWD platform with longitudinal engine; the time-proven setup for athletic handling, the ‘driver’s choice’. The newer QX50 J55 chassis follows the crowd by switching to a FWD layout with a transverse (sideways) engine. This ‘old’ car has a naturally aspirated and very powerful V6 engine, the new one a turbo-charged four enhanced with the additional mechanical complexity of variable compression; also amply powered but so far not noticeably more efficient. This old one has a proper 7-spd automatic transmission, the new one has today’s requisite CVT that sometimes doesn’t know what it should be doing. How do I know all this? I just bought this ‘old’ one, whereas my wife had just gotten a J55 first year 2019 QX50 a month earlier. Both cars are just about fully loaded with all the important technology. My wife’s 2019 has some extra goodies I wish mine had, especially the heads-up display.
     Prior to this I’ve owned two Audis, four BMWs, a 2004 Cadillac CTS-V, an Infiniti G35x (2007), and a Lexus ES300h hybrid. This 2017 Infiniti QX50 is an amalgamation of the best qualities of all of these vehicles with the oft-noted exception of its mediocre gas mileage (a hybrid it’s not!). This car handles and rides as good as any of my BMWs did and better than the Lexus (which I still own but am now selling). It accelerates with the kind of ferocity the CTS-V was known for but carves corners even better. Finally, it has better cargo carrying flexibility, seats up or down, than any of them, even though some competitors offer even more. 
     Technology wise, it’s voice-guided nav system was so far ahead of its time in 2007 that it’s still more then adequate ten years later and does everything you would want it to. That sad I wish it had Apple CarPlay so I could use Waze which is frankly superior to any car’s built in system; Infiniti didn’t incorporate that into the QX50 until its 2020 model year. My car has the top-shelf Bose system which I would put in the top 10% of car audio systems, but it’s definitely not a Lexus Mark Levinson system which is top 2%. And unlike some of my prior cars, it has AWD which makes it more practical year-round in sometimes snowy SE PA. In short, it has gathered together the best qualities of all of the cars I’ve enjoyed in the past, however this time they’re delivered with Japanese quality, reliability and low cost of ownership that some of those other manufacturers sadly are not known for. And BTW, I’ve been getting about 20 mpg in non-highway driving and up to 27 on the highway, which isn’t horrible considering the performance the car is capable of. 
     I will add though, that however successful Infiniti was at combining all of those virtues into a single vehicle, the resulting styling and form somewhat miss the mark. I do not turn and look over my shoulder at the car the same way I did my Bimmers, the CTS-V or even the Lexus. Those cars had a narrower purpose which simplified their designers’ missions and influenced the purity of their shapes. This QX50 is to cars what a platypus is to ducks and beavers. In fairness though, I can’t think of any SUV-like vehicle that would inspire that old kind of passion, so this isn’t a real hit against the QX50. 
     If you can tolerate mediocre mpg, but otherwise would appreciate actual ‘sport’ with your ‘utility’, this last of its kind cross-over hits the mark in a way that only sports sedans usually do, but with practicality thrown in for good measure. Seating for four six-footers is comfortable, fit and finish are Japanese precise, and materials satisfy luxury expectations. The 7"" display is smaller than most today but still gets the job done. Actual push buttons for climate and radio controls (which I prefer) live below it and so
 the smalIer screen serves its more limited purpose very well. I  have the 19” wheels which sharpen the cornering with so sacrifice to ride comfort. 
     I don’t see myself replacing this car for a good many years not only because it scratches almost every automotive itch I have, but also because it’s the last of a dying breed that they literally won’t make any more.

Entrance lights to illuminate the outside are only on the driver side.  No one never enters in the dark on the passenger side?  The cup holders are useless.  You can only fit one cup in it and hope that the liquid inside does not spill because they are so cheap.  No automatic lift gate.  No way to stop the review mirrors from turning down when backing up.  The back up camera is not clear and gives you a distorted view of objects.  No sensors to let you know when you are approaching something from the rear.

"
infiniti,qx50,2017,Doobster6, 12/29/2020,Almost the perfect all-around vehicle,4,"I had suffered for years with the exceedingly high annual operating costs of off-warranty European cars, especially BMWs, which are the worst. Being newly retired I wanted a vehicle that was satisfying to drive but wouldn’t cost arms and legs to keep on the road. With one glaring exception, this specific model-year compact SUV is that car.

THE BAD:
Gas mileage is mediocre at best. I see 18 in non-highway driving and no better than 27 highway, and these figures are achieved only under a somewhat sedate driving style. Anyone pressing the right pedal hard enough to enjoy the awesome 325 hp V6 engine will see that drop, and by a lot! These days mid-sized SUVs get better mileage than that, although they can’t boast the power this car has. 
     Mixed Tech. While its NAV system is still useful (it was WAY ahead of its time when first introduced in 2007) it is not WAZE, which I still use. But it lacks Apple car-play or Android integration, so you’re stuck having to use the smartphone when modern cars would display WAZE on the car’s own screen.

THE GOOD:
This is a much longer list!! First of all, this was the last year for this model built on its original RWD architecture and the car’s handling match my 2008 BMW 335xi. This is abetted in my specific car which is a ‘fully loaded’ model that has the optional 19” wheels. But unlike that BMW, ride quality is also superb, matching the larger BMW 530xi I also once owned. I’m not sure how Infiniti blended both handling and ride into one car but they did. I prize chassis dynamics above all else and this car does it all!
     The engine is awesome!! No turbo-lag in this naturally aspirated engine! It does have variable valve timing and lift and so it can re-tune itself to be anything you need it to be. It produces 325 relentless horsepower that pull like a freight train, falling just a smidgen behind that aforementioned 335xi. It’s fierce acceleration is surprising and almost frightening as it seems to accelerate harder the higher the revs rise. And it has no turbocharger(s) that will eventually fail and be very expensive to later replace. This VQ series of engine produced by Nissan have won awards for many years owing to their stout horsepower and reliability.
     Interior space is more than adequate. A 4” chassis stretch in 2016 added rear seat leg room that allows 6+ footers to ride comfortably in this car. The seats are well formed and comfortable. A keen eye will notice that the bottom seat bolsters are smaller near the center console, so that a hand can fit between them to retrieve the wallet or sunglasses that just dropped there. This is a small but thoughtful detail that you may come to appreciate many times! Behind the back seats you have 18 cu ft of space; as much as any full-sized sedan’s trunk but fold the seats down and now you have 50 cu ft. This increases the utility of this vehicle way beyond any sedan you might choose to replace with it.
     Real buttons!!! Modern cars have one or even two touch screens that bury common functions under several layers of screen menus. This car has ‘old fashioned’ radio volume and tuning rotary knobs, as well as six station buttons that I frankly prefer. Many other screens can also be instantly accessed via hard buttons conveniently placed in front of the display. 
     Modern safety tech! Being fully loaded, my car has the tech package which includes adaptive headlights, Bird’s-eye view surround camera, BLIS, LDW, LDA, FCA, FCA, Rear traffic cross alert and adaptive cruise. While some of these can sometimes be annoying, they are always a safety advantage.
     Great interior look and materials! You will know you are not in a Honda or Toyota. It is a premium car and looks and feels that way. Chrome trim on the outside completes the effect.
     AWD. Infiniti has improved their intelligent AWD over the years and it nearly matches Audi’s Quattro
 in responsiveness. Yet the car remains a RWD vehicle when AWD is not needed, improving handling and cornering.

In short, this is the best all-around vehicle I have ever owned. It combines the best features of many of the European cars I’ve owned with better utility and adequate technology. I love driving it as much as any car I’ve ever owned (well maybe not the stick-shift CTS-V!). Only the relatively poor gas mileage keeps me from giving the car a full five-star rating. Nevertheless, it looks like something I’m going to want to keep for many years to come. It does it all, does it all well enough for my needs!

infiniti,qx50,2019,Wayne Locke, 01/11/2019,Electrical systems fail,3,"The controls on the central console have a tendency to fail.  You will not be able to disconnect a phone call and all the controls freeze preventing adjustments to the navigation, climate control, radio and blue tooth phone.  There have also been incidents of the entire screen going black.  This happens while the vehicle is in operation and can cause a very dangerous situation.  infiniti has acknowledged the situation.  They were able to replicate the problem at the dealership and admitted to numerous other similar complaints.  I first raised the issue in November of 2018.  As of January 10, 2019, they do not have a solution and the problem is continuing to occur.   This goes beyond inconvenience.  Failure of these systems while the vehicle is in operation causes a dangerous situation."
infiniti,qx50,2019,Ray, 07/03/2019,Unsafe at Any Speed,1,"This car is trying to kill me.

The driver ""assist"" controls are dialed back as far as they will go, and yet the car will still:
- Slam on the brakes when a car up ahead slows down, even when it's still very far ahead;
- Slam on the brakes when passing into an underground parking lot, going from light to dark; and
- Steer straight on when I'm trying to make a turn at a junction where there are two or more turn lanes and I am not in the inside-most lane.

I am in danger of getting rear-ended just driving in traffic, because the car doesn't just tap the brakes, it goes for a full-on, emergency, 30mph to zero stop on a dime.  No one is expecting it, especially me, so I am just lucky that - so far - the driver behind has had their wits about them.  What if it was an 18-wheeler?  I'm toast!  Once it stops, it pauses for a few seconds before it will let me go again; cue honking of horns.  Same with the parking lot issue.

The turn issue is very scary.  Even though I will be making a legal and safe turn, but not in the inside-most lane, the car will override my steering input (it's fly-by-wire) and drive me straight on into the traffic waiting on the other side of the intersection.  I have to come to a stop before the car will allow me to make my turn, meaning that I am having to stop in the middle of a large intersection just so the car will agree with me to turn the wheels.

I have the same trouble as others have mentioned here with the screens crapping out and going black.  I am a real estate agent, so I need navigation but, more than this, I drive with my clients in the car.  I do not know for sure, but I suspect I have lost clients because they think I am a terrible/dangerous driver (even when it's not putting all aboard in danger, it's beeping and flashing warning signs because of things other road users are doing).  The phone connection is random too - so I am constantly dropping client calls - and I have never been able to upload destinations to the navigation system from remote, which was a big selling feature for me.

My Infinity dealer is overloaded with cars back for service; a situation that is exacerbated with a layer of incompetence.  I have to have a car for work, so getting this in to be fixed (if they can even do that) is nigh-on impossible.  They tell me they need it for a least a week, but don't have loaners available.  I have shown up for scheduled appointments, only to be told that they have ""run out"" of loaners, so I leave without service and having wasted my time (which, to a real estate agent, is money).

I have told them to shut down the driver assist features entirely, but they say it's hard-wired into the car and I have it as dialed back as far the system will allow.  If I could hand back the keys and walk away, I'd do it.

1-star review, only because they don't allow zero.

infiniti,qx50,2019,Gary, 02/16/2019,"Locked in lease w/o car,NO PARTS AVAILABLE!!!!!!!!",1,"Infiniti released the new QX50 without sufficient back up parts. So far, I have paid $2,500 worth of car payments and $700 for car insurance for a car I don’t have, due to a passenger door not being available.
On Oct 30, 2018, a deer jumped a guardrail into the side of my new car I’d had for just 2 months. I was told I’d have my car back by Nov 28, 2018. Fast forward 4 months, I’m still without my car and there is no eta when the parts will be available. This means 6+ months without a car I’m paying on! I opened a claim last month with Infiniti Consumer Affairs only for them to continue to apologize with no solution. They recommended I talk to Metro Infiniti in Monrovia where I purchased the car. Metro Infiniti says they can’t provide a courtesy car, nor do they have the authority to let me out of my lease. They said Consumer Affairs has the authority to manage my situation. Consumer Affairs then said Infiniti Finance has the authority to assist me. The Infiniti Finance supervisor, Keith, referred me back to Consumer Affairs. I spoke to Consumer Affairs supervisor “Will” (who refused to give me his last name or let me talk to another manager) who referred me back to Metro Infiniti. I have now left the general manager, Harris, 2 messages with no returned call. This is after leaving Sales Manager, Vincent 4 messages with no returned call.

I work full time, have a family and wake up every morning wondering how I’m going to get to work, getting my child to day care, and doctors appointments. I have been incredibly patient but I’m at my wits’ end. This is not ok. I NEED OUT OF MY LEASE. There is no end in sight yet I have to continue to pay them monthly to spare my credit.

If that’s not enough, here’s the back story on how we’ve been wronged from the beginning. From selling us a damaged car (cracked panorama roof panels), to wrongfully sending me to their collections department, twice. Would you believe when I overpaid, they sent me a refund check that was returned to them because they didn’t have my correct address, yet they still posted it against my account as though I had cashed it!? I’d imagine this is illegal! This put my account into delinquency for a check I never received! This is my 4th Infiniti and this is how they treat their loyal patrons!

Someone was well aware of the cracked panels, because my husband found a razor blade on the roof as we were driving the car off the lot. It was dark so we didn’t see it until we got home and pulled in the garage under the light. They claim they had no idea and ended up replacing the panels. WE WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED A DAMAGED CAR.
They sent me to collections (the first time) because my bill was 18 days overdue, because Metro did not provide Infiniti Finance with my mailing address. I called them because I never received a bill.

Two months later  I was sent to collections the second time for the check I never received (it was returned to them) that they posted against my account. This has been a nightmare of an experience from beginning to now, still without a car. Please help hold them accountable!  This is the craziest, most dishonorable situation I’ve ever experienced. Please help bring attention to this situation.

It is not ok to keep me in a lease for a car they aren’t providing for me, with no end in sight!
DO NOT BUY INFINITI!!!

infiniti,qx50,2019,PDX-Max, 06/22/2018,Drivers' Car ...,4,"I picked this car a couple of weeks back & have put about 1500 miles on it. The most recent being a 1000 mile vacation trip my family. 

5 of us, all adults ranging from 5 feet to 6 feet, average build, had no problems on our 3 day vacation trip. The cargo room was large enough, with some room to spare, to hold our baggage, camp food, water, light winter clothing, medical+emergency box, etc. The second row passenger space seated 3 of us comfortably & for about an hour or so, I sat in the back and yielded the wheel to my son since I was falling asleep after a heavy lunch. 

The QX50 handled the roads like a champ & the torque was available immediately. FWIW, I drove the whole route in the Standard drive mode. True, the get-out-of-the-gate lag is there & is noticeable. But once you get past that initial 3 to 5 seconds, the SUV is yours to play with. Transmission is smooth & I do prefer the CVT after it starts to get going. Driving through the canyons from John Day to I84 was a breeze. The car stayed glued to the road and drove in the direction I pointed. And I knew I had power if I needed it. (Side note: For a few days I drove this in the sport mode & did not notice the start up lag. It shows up in the eco & standard mode for me.)

Our car is loaded with the Proactive & Sensory package. And we made use of the safety systems to its fullest. Keeping the car in a straight line with slight curves @ 80mph on I5 & I84 was no brainer. (Yes Iget assist with a radar detector as well.). Stop & Go traffic is not a problem - except a small peeve: I would like the car to start driving the moment it senses the other car start to move. But yes, this can be construed as a safety issue, necessitating driver interaction. 

The auto high beam was blessing as well, along with the 'foot kick' to open the trunk. I personally like the dual screens - one for nav & the other for entertainment. Some people don't; but I prefer having one screen for nav constanly as opposed to doubling up for other functions. I prefer the physical controls as well; but the placement of the climate on/off switch is odd imho. 

The car is silent & all the 5 of us were able to hold conversation without raising our voices or such. Creature comforts abounds in the car & we do miss the front thigh extension; the massager, etc. But for the price vs features, this car is a bargain.

Some of my issues:
- We got the lifestyle hitch & it sits deeply & away from the public eye. Great, except some of the bike racks don't have that depth. This will mean an hitch extension purchase.
- I did not figure out if there was a way to transfer music to local hard drive - if present. If not, then its a bummer since the USB needs to be there permanently.
- No access to apps like Spotify, Pandora, etc. And no Android Auto.
- More & more SUVs are having storage space under the electronic shifter; but this one does not. Not sure why this could not have been accomodated.
- Speaking of shifter, you shift forard to reverse & shift back to drive. Guess, you get used to it. :-)
- The side mirros don't auto fold.
- No rear seat heat.

FWIW, we started our (re)search with about 10 SUVs ranging from MKX, Q5, XC60 & 90, CX9, Edge, Fpace, GLS, GLE, XKT, etc. We narrowed it down to XC90, QX50, MKX. We wrote out our needs/wants & price/value for these and settled on the QX50. Time will tell, especially with the CVT, if this is a good buy. But for now, I think I got a good one. The car looks great - check, drives like a sports car - check, good fuel economy (based on drive mode) - check, fuel range in excess of 320 miles to the tank - check, creature comforts - check, safety & driving aids - check. 

Good value for the price paid.

Multiple efforts to have Infinity intervene have been totally unsuccessful. I WOULD NEVER OWN AN INFINITY AGAIN

infiniti,qx50,2019,T Johnson, 03/29/2019,"Great In Many Ways, But Misled In One Big One",4,"I have owned several Infiniti's over the years and consider myself a fan.  The QX50 seems to get great reviews for its overall looks, and for its interior, and not so good for its handling (especially the CVT) and its entertainment system (supposedly dated, and no Apple or Android until 2020).  Most of those negatives I disagree with.  I enjoy driving it and only occasionally am I conscious of the CVT...it definitely moves right along, especially in Sport mode.  And the entertainment & nav system is just fine....looks nice (yes, a high resolution display would be nicer), logical, easy, and it works.  OK, I guess the Apple/Android systems might ease some functions, but they also bring some downside....like using up your phone's data plan.  Overall, I'm happy with it, except for one major point: I feel misled about gas mileage.  My experience is the same as reported by Consumer Reports...Infiniti and the EPA are overstating real world mpg by at least 15% as measured by the in-car system, and by over 20% if you calculate mpg on your own (using your real gallons of gas used and real miles covered.)  Given all the touting of their innovation new engine, this is a real let down.  Now, I have done some research on how the EPA (and CR) do there mileage tests, and other studies show the speed of my driving has a lot to do with my lower mileage.  Apparently the QX50 is notably worse (lower mpg, more overstated) in this regard than its competitors, even with their less high tech engines.....but then their EPA estimates themselves are lower than those for the QX50, and their really world performance apparently isn't much different.   I have to conclude that my mileage is apparently similar to that of competitors.  Never the less, it is disappointing given the expectation that Infiniti has set.  Given that, I have lowered my rating to only 4 stars for an otherwise very nice vehicle.

infiniti,qx50,2019,Larry T, 09/21/2018,Great car but could be better,4,"Most reviewers comment on the tranny.  I agree generally but do you really drive like Mario Andretti?  Didn’t think so.  the transverse CVT gives enormous cabin space when compared to a longitudinal arrangement.  I would, however, do away with the fake shifts.  Total waste. 
Same with the shift paddles. Again, am I driving like Mario or a middle aged suburbanite?   instead they should spend the $ on something useful - like ventilated seats at the trim level I bought.   I love this on my wife’s 2018 Lexus NX. Overall I think the car is great.  Getting 31.8 mpg highway. Plenty of torque at every rpm level. Seats are great. Car is very quiet except on hard acceleration.  As I previously owned a 2015 q50, I am used to the info/nav systems and generally consider them better than many.  Sure apple play would be nice but I really don’t see it as a big issue.  One negative is Infiniti Touch. Nothing but problems with setting it up. Still not working. Steering is crisp and responsive. I think they fixed the old issues with the fly by wire.
Update-3/20:
Engine is great. Very powerful. Tranny is not smooth unless you accelerate hard. Local driving is much less pleasant than highway driving. Just hard to get smooth acceleration at slower speeds.  Stick with Lexus. I prefer my wife’s NX.

infiniti,qx50,2019,Janel G, 09/01/2019,Don't do it!,1,"I parked the car in the garage when I brought it home, and the garage filled with an engine fume smell – that never went away as long as I had the car (drove about 5000 miles on it before I stopped driving it all together and parked it in the front yard). Eventually my family and I started having symptoms to the smell filling the garage and house (like allergies and sore throat). 

I began parking the car outside and had to make sure that the interior air flow button was on or the car would fill with the smell when driving. The MPG this car was supposed to get was a joke – it averaged 22 MPG, and I was at the gas pump constantly. The brakes were squishy, there was a delay in acceleration when I hit the gas; overall the car was a mess with this new engine they released for the 2019 Qx50. 

I asked the dealership to take a look, they stated they could not replicate the engine smell that was poisoning us. I asked to talk to the manager, they would not allow it – I did talk to the service Manager and he said he knew nothing about this issue (when I said I see other complaints about the same thing on-line form other people), but he said he would look into it. I never heard anything. 

I again asked to talk to a manager and was referred to Infiniti consumer affairs. I wrote a letter of complaint, talked to a person there and they did not care. They denied that they had knowledge of this issue as well. I took the car to a different dealership – as soon as I described they issue they said they ARE AWARE that the engine fume is an issue and they HAVE received a lot of complaints from other people, and Infiniti had sent a bulletin to dealerships letting them know it’s a known issue.

I hired a lawyer and finally got a buy back on the car because it’s an obvious lemon.  "
infiniti,qx50,2019,Kenneth Dara, 12/22/2018,Check out the tires before you buy.,4,"After leasing the QX50 I was told that it came with run flat tires, had no idea what these tires were. You can run 50 miles And a good chance of distorting the rim. The car comes without a spare and no jack. If you make it to a tire repair place 90% they will not have a replacement tire since they sell very few. Plan to spend time while they find the same brand and size. If you get a blow out you screwed. A new tire cost around $300 each. If I knew this I would of thought twice about the purchase.

When that wasn't enough, my wife resorted to backing the QX50 in the garage so that the engine compartment faced the opening of the garage to aid in the airing out process. We contacted an Infiniti dealer and they couldn't find anything wrong with it, of course. We then took it to another dealer and they admitted that there seems to be a growing number of complaints and that a fix has been identified. They performed the 'unofficial' fix but there still seems to be an odor coming from the engine compartment. We can't keep this up for another 3 years so we may be forced to turn the car in and break the lease. We'll see how that goes.

I dropped my 2017 QX50 as soon as I could to buy this one & it was a wise choice.  The 2017 was horrible to me & had too much power that drank up premium fuel like it was beer on a hot night.  The 2019 mpg still isn't great but it is an improvement & so many other improvements make up for the mpg.  Everything is better.  I tested other make/model cars & came back to this one.

I have been driving Infiniti products for almost 30 years and it seems that the more tech that they put into new models the worse the product becomes. The style of this new model was a plus along with the interior room and look. The problems showed up in the driving. I found the power to be surging while in city traffic and while on the highway the power was slow to show up when I needed it. The feel of the wheel just feels artificial due to the intelligent steering system. The same problem I experienced on my Q50 when that model was first introduced. Braking felt soft and I just didn't trust it. This vehicle is just not for me.

infiniti,qx50,2019,John, 10/21/2018,Well Beyond Expectations,5,"This car rocks!  If you are looking for performance and good MPG's in a roomy SUV, this is what got me hooked on the QX50.  It's quieter than the 2019 Lexus RX50 and Acura RDX.  The 16 speaker Bose system is a concert hall on wheels.  It is exceptionally roomy to where I can haul sports equipment and fit four comfortably.  Two thumbs way up!

Car is very comfortable and the gas mileage is right on par with the rating.  The transmission can be jumpy if you punch the gas.  I still recommend buying the car if you are interested.

11/03/20  Still love the car.  My MPGs are better than what other people think.  Many trips for our family with lacrosse equipment and overnight bags and it all fits in the back.  The seats are incredibly comfortable.  I have had zero maintenance issues and there are 50k miles on the car.  The transmission is a bit jerky at times and there are times when there is a turbo lag.  Just means you have to accelerate the car smoothly.  Overall, I love the car.

infiniti,qx50,2019,Ted Stanley , 10/05/2019,Love My QX50,5,"I’ve had my QX50 for six months now.  I think it’s a great car. It’s one of the best looking SUVs on the road. I’ve noticed other drivers speeding up to check out what I’m driving. I’m 6’4” and I have lots of leg room. I love the car’s interior too. I’m getting 26 mpg city/highway. I hear about drivers getting 20 mpg. I think they have a very heavy foot.  It depends on how any car is driven. The controls are simple and logical. It does have soft braking but it’s dependable. The is very quick and I have the steering set to sport mode which gives more feel for the drive by wire steering. Acceleration is smooth and constant. The shifter takes a bit of getting used to as pushing forward is reverse and back is forward. I think Audio’s have the same setup. The run flat tires are a bit unforgiving on very bumpy roads but great on smooth roads. If you need an OEM replacement tire go to Tire Rack. I’ve read a lot of negative comments about the driver assist braking system on the car. I’ve had no problems with it. If it’s on and your driving very fast before you brake with another ahead the car will brake hard.  I’ve found the car will automatically brake at different speeds depending on how fast on coming up on the car in front on you. So if you usually speed and brake late the car will engage much quicker and harder on automatic braking. It’s not the system’s fault. I think it’s a great system when I see so many drivers texting while they’re driving and paying attention to the road. Good work Inifiniti!!!  But again. The system can be turned off easily if it annoys you. Ive never had gassy smells in my car. Certain states use higher blends of ethanol in their gas. That may be the problem. Finally. The car has be very reliable.  I’ve had 3 other Infiniti cars. Kept each at least six years. Never had a problem with any if them. My car is extremely comfortable, looks great inside and out, rides like a champ and it has excellent mpg.

infiniti,qx50,2019,Ed, 08/29/2019,Disappointed,2,"The larger size is the improvement. That is all. The turbo 4 very noisy and no comparison to the  former model V6. Infiniti is know for their performance/responsive engines; “why change”? Any change in gas mileage is virtually non existent. Lose the electronic transmission. Think about it; any time you have to read a manual to figure out how to put the vehicle in reverse, neutral or park is an issue. Going from my Q50 to the QX50 is always another learning experience. The lane departure warning sends a “vibration” up through the steering wheel. Very unsettling. Think about it; go back to a sound/beep. Now turned off! Heads up display; not needed, not wanted and a total distraction and turned off. Infiniti may want to try some focus groups next time. The previous model only had a size issue but much better and friendly high level performer. This new one will not be a flagship leader and hope some changes made (better fix this one and do same for the upcoming coupe which sounds same except you slant the roof...is there really a market for a coupe model?).

infiniti,qx50,2019,Dundas, 09/11/2019,"*** DO NOT BUY QX50 * 5,000 MILE ENGINE FAILURE **",1,"Bought a 2019 QX50 with 4,800 miles on it which was a loaner car. Had the car delivered to my work. Initially was very impressed with the interior design and overall feel of the car but it went to hell in a hand basket pretty quickly. Had the car delivered at work. Drove it home. Wife absolutely loved it. Drove it to work the next day. Leaving work that following day the car would not start. Mind you less than 5,000 miles on the car. Get it towed to Infiniti which is only 1 mile down the street from my office. They call me and tell me the started is fried and it will be replaced within 1 day. Not a big deal. I get a phone call the next day with the wonderful news that the starter did not fix the car and it needs an engine?!?!??!?!?! What?! Service advisor re-assures me this is not unusual for this engine as they are quite fussy with all the new variable compression technology that is part of it. He did explain that there were metal shavings inside the engine oil pan so something wore out. A replacement engine was going to be there the following week and all is covered under warranty. 

Service advisor calls me 2 days later stating Infiniti canceled the engine which was ordered and this repair would no longer be covered under warranty. The reason being? The previous owner of the vehicle had a starting issue at some point in the last 6 months and the car spent 2 months at the dealership (different state). This other stealership concluded per the technicians story on the repair order that the engine was likely submerged due to water they found in several electrical connectors. 

A few things here sound very fishy. Why would it have been at that dealership for 2 months? Also water in an electrical connector can likely be from many different sources (condensation, engine being washed, driving trough rain, etc). Also water in a connector does NOT automatically mean there is water inside the engine? What logic is being used there????? If you had a broken finger does that automatically mean you have bone cancer? 

Icing on the cake is that the service manager at my local Infiniti dealership is stating (I have proof) that she does not see any evidence of water in the engine. She also stated the engine failure is internal and has nothing to do with water in the engine. She also requested for Infiniti to send out a field technical specialist (an engineer) to her dealership and the engine would be disassembled for him to inspect it and determine cause of failure. According to the manager Infiniti declined to do this. 

The dealership then denied my request to tear the engine down (for which I would pay for) to proof the failure is caused by water. This would be impossible as the engine was running perfectly fine the day prior. I think they were well aware of this as they refused to tear the engine down even on my own dime.

So there is no warranty coverage and I am on my own to get the engine replaced. The cost to replace the engine with a new one is approximately $20,000.00. A used engine is about half that.
I have had the engine removed in the meantime and torn down. The failure was caused by tolerances that were too tight between the connecting rod bearings and connecting rod journals. There is evidence of the connecting rods becoming quite hot as the metal is discolored blue and purple.

This is a defect from the factory and given the FACTS now that the engine failure has been CORRECTLY identified I am not surprised this engine has failed at less than 5,000 miles. 

The internal engine parts to repair this failure ARE NOT AVAILABLE. They may never be available as Infiniti has no intention of selling the internal engine parts. ONLY a complete engine assembly is available. 

THIS IS A COMPLETE PILE [non-permissible content removed]. I have a $40,000 paper weight. It needs a $20,000-$25,000 repair to get it running again.

 CUSTOMER SERVICE BUSINESS AND WITH THIS KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY WILL NOT HAVE ANY CUSTOMERS.

It's currently in the shop, but they have already called saying everything is checking out fine. Be cautious with buying this model!

infiniti,qx50,2019,Ning X, 08/21/2019,Very disappointed,1,"bought a brand new QX50 in September 2018 and the map in the Navigation system is at least 3 years old. Infiniti customer care told me that is completely reasonable and I will have to order to by myself to have it updated. Second, the forward emergency system does not work as it shows on YouTube or on their website. When you test drive it, you might want to pay attention to it. Third the sun roof makes rattling noise, it took a long time and multiple visits to fix it and I was told by the dealer that the part is very hard to get.

infiniti,qx50,2019,Elena, 09/16/2019,Horrible vehicle,1,"I have Infiniti QX50 2019 and 18000 miles on it. The car giving me a problems from the beginning.
1. AC doesn't work good, it never goes lower than 76, one time AC didn't work at all. Dealer looked at it and said they didn't find any issue, asked to bring the car when AC stop working again. 
2. Back passenger door lock is got broken, it doesn't open the door from remote control or other doors. I must turn the lock open using my hand, manually. I have two little kids in their carseats there and if something will happen, I will have no chance to take them out quickly. 
3. Today I was driving with two of my little kids and felt a super strong gas smell inside the car. I felt dizzy, start falling asleep. I stopped the car. Thanks God, my husband wasn't far away, he took kids with him. Now, I am on tow truck, towing my car home. 
I can't go to work and my school tomorrow, over the phone AAA told me that it's not safe to drive my car due to possible fire. 
I will tow the car to the dealer tomorrow.

infiniti,qx50,2019,NJ Driver, 10/21/2019,Meh,3,"I rented a QX50 LUXE 4dr Front-wheel Drive for a week and drove around town and on the interstate. Uninspiring is my best description. Great engine killed by a lousy CVT transmission. Full acceleration blunted by the CVT and lack of traction where you need to keep correcting to stay in a straight line. Handling OK for this class, but dead steering. On the plus side nice interior and good exterior styling. Comfortable, definitely not a drivers car at least in this trim level. Better SUVs I think can be had for less.

infiniti,qx50,2019,jason, 09/12/2018,DANGEROUS LEMON,1,"do not buy this car or the nissan rouge if they have run flat tires.  I have had my car for 4 months and got a routine flat tire.  i was perplexed when I found no spare in the car.  i took the infiniti to the nearest dealership who told me the run flat tires cannot be patched.  they must be replaced.  the car does not come with a spare.  so 12 days later I am still waiting for the OEM replacement from japan, india, or china-who knows.  I get on average 3 flat tires a year because of the heavy home construction in southern CA, and 40k miles a year I put on any car. if you want a car that you cannot drive anywhere, this is the car for you!  I cannot drive to vegas, phoenix, anywhere, because there are no services for 75-100 miles in the middle of the desert.  I cannot wait in the 115 degree heat for a tow truck that will take 4 hours to get to me.  this run flat no spare tire is an asinine idea, and a serious consumer safety threat.  I now have to replace all 4 tires with Michelins that can be patched and I still will not have a spare...  I do not want to lug around a 5th rim and tire in my passenger seat, or smell that stink in the cabin.  so, if you want to pay $1300 for a rental car and $325 dollars for a replacement tire, and have no spare, and have the car down for 45 days a year THIS IS THE CAR FOR YOU.  demand the tire replacement and a spare/jack b 4 buying.  or die in the desert, get robbed, raped or murdered, waiting for a tow truck.  I paid 41800 on an msrp of 47800."
infiniti,qx50,2019,NoMoReInFiNiTi, 08/13/2019,Disappointed Infiniti Customer,1,"I have driven Toyotas, Hondas, Lexus, Mercedes and Lincolns before. I change my cars every 2-3 years, as I prefer lease them. I wish I had read some of these reviews before purchasing this 2019 QX50. 
I have had this car for a year now and for the amount of money I am paying, I expected something that had gone through extensive testing prior to being released. This car has several design flaws. First of all, why would you put the car in ""park"" with a button??? Yes, there is no ""P"" on the shift. It's a button right beside it. I think this is very unsafe. Second, putting the car in neutral is a whole other problem. You have to barely tap the shift back, but this doesn't always work. So every time I go through the car wash I have to tell the attendant to give me a few extra seconds until I can put the car in neutral. Very frustrating!
I had several instances when I started the engine and the infotainment was off (I always have the radio on). I would press the on button but it wouldn't turn on. This gets fixed once the engine is turned off and then on again. The dealership was able to fix the issue with an update. I had to leave the car at the dealership for a few days for this. Another issue I had was that every time I would back out of the driveway, there was a sound in the sunroof track area like there was something rolling back and forth. At the dealership they said they disassembled and reassembled the tracks to fix the issue. Now the sound is like something hitting metal. I am tired of going back to the dealership. This is a lease and I am just waiting to hit 2 years to trade it in. My daughter-in-law has the same car and has had the same sunroof issue as well. Additionally, sometimes her car makes this weird sound like it's on first gear and it's on high rpm when it's on drive-standard mode. They haven't been able to replicate it at the dealership so she is having to deal with it. She is also having issues with Bluetooth calls. She is just as frustrated as I am!
Another thing that I can't stand about this car (as others mentioned as well) is that it slams on the breaks for no apparent reason. I keep my distance from the cars in front so this is very annoying. There were only 2 instances when it actually reacted when it should have. 
Two days ago I was driving under an overpass (I drove through this area many times)and it suddenly stopped and ""beeped"" like crazy. Did it detect a ghost?? This car is just a nicely dressed Nissan  Not worth what I'm paying for it   :(
NO MORE INFINITI FOR ME!!!"
infiniti,qx50,2019,New QX50 owner, 03/20/2019,Great car BUT VERY POOOOOOOOR GAS MILEAGE,3,"I like everything about the car except the dated infotainment system that I knew going in.  However, the gas mileage is TERRIBLE and no where near what the EPA says.  It's horrible. I read the Car&Driver review that said they got 27mpg and that was a clincher for me. I took a 230 mile trip this past weekend (have had the car 1 month) of which 90% was highway and I only got 23mpg.  EPA says 30mpg highway, I was hoping for 27 to be realistic.  I am greatly disappointed and would not have purchased had I known it was smoke and mirrors. Consumer Reports said that it is a rarity for a model to be so far off the EPA numbers.  Do a search on the article. If gas mileage is not an issue with you then I say you will love the rest of the vehicle.

I'm waiting for the weather to get better. This is my second Infinity the first was a 2007 fx35 so i do know Infinity is a good car. I had know problems with it at all. So i really excited about getting it on the highway.  It's a lot of fun to drive. I do have a small complaint about the gear shift it takes a little getting used to it's different from the others.

infiniti,qx50,2019,SRINIVAS KATUKOJWALA, 09/28/2018,I love this newly designed Infiniti Qx50,4,"I was looking for a Hybrid Luxury SUV , One day I ended up going to Infiniti dealer and checked out 2019 QX50, just fell in love with it and bought it. The sales team was wonderful and absolutely friendly. 

I have owned it for couple of months now, I bought a fully loaded QX50 Essential with everything that this model can have. It is stunningly great purchase.  I am getting good city fuel economy almost 22 City and 27 High way.  I was big fan of Honda cars for last 22 years and when it comes to luxury cars I did not want to buy anything from Honda/Acura, so I checked out BMW, Mercedes, Lexus and Infiniti and bought it.  Lots of cargo space and fantastic second row seating with lots of leg room. 

I love the meticulously designed interiors of the car and very smooth ride. I notice lots of QX60 on the road and I am sure by next year you will end up seeing lots of QX50s .  You buy a luxury car to get a very smooth ride and feel the luxurious interiors and features, I love the features that this car has.   The Infotainment system (which is least important) need some good work but Loved having two screens one for Navigation and one for utilities and features.  These days most of the cars use CVT Transmission but will give very smooth ride compared to traditional transmission. European car fans should check this car for sure. I love the new VC Turbo Engine and all the driving modes.

infiniti,qx50,2019,Rick, 06/15/2018,Amazing Vehicle,5,"Honestly, you soak in luxury sitting in this vehicle. It's amazingly comfortable and wonderful to drive. I love all the features and love the MPG for a heavy car like this.

infiniti,qx50,2019,awaters, 09/24/2019,Probably should not have bought it,2,"2020 update: This car protected my wife EXTREMELY well in a head-on collision caused by another driver simply not seeing her. Thank you Infiniti engineers for the well-done crumple zones and airbags all over the place! Having said that, the car is a total loss, and a QX50 is not on our shopping list for the replacement.

Our car was: Essential 2wd, dark blue, black interior, with ProACTIVE and Sensory packages. Bought used at a dealer Dec 2018 with 1700 miles. Now pushing 18k, driven mostly by a mom, also used for family trips. Overall review is decidedly mixed - details are below.

Pros: 
1. Love the look, inside and out. Drew us in right from the beginning and very pleased with it.
2. Great ride on smooth roads. It just eats up miles on road trips!
3. Right-sized for a family of 3 or 4. Great room in the seats, and enough cargo space even for a get-away for 4, as long as you are not hauling stuff for very young kids (strollers, etc). 
4. Supremely comfortable and quiet cabin. Seats are incredible, and very adjustable. Climate control could probably get colder quicker (I live in the deep South), but is OK, especially if you crank up the ventilated seats. 
5. essential package has (almost) every feature I would want, and a few extra also. I like the heads up display more than I thought I would.

Cons:
1. Gas mileage. As others have stated, the advertised gas mileage is completely, 100%, fully, a lie. We average just over 22mpg with a mix of road trips (25% of mileage) and in town family car stuff (other 75%). Improving the mileage from the larger SUV we used to have was one of the reasons we bought this car and we are sorely disappointed in it.
2. Run flat tires. Having had one flat already, and it taking days to get a replacement tire due to limited availability, this is not something I would want on a car again. If there was room for a spare under the cargo floor, I would buy another wheel and spare and put regular tires on it. As a bonus, 5k miles after the tire was replaced, the car still tells me I have a flat - with 37 psi showing on the indicator. LOL
3. Takes bumps surprisingly harshly. Might be the 20"" wheels, might be the run flats, might be both, but it really thumps hard over some road imperfections.
4. WAY overaggressive driver intervention system. Some of these reviews seem to show that theirs is malfunctioning - ours is not. I think it is working as designed, but it truly gets in the way of driving at times. I cannot count the number of times it has started the panic braking for a situation that did not require it. I don't like the distance-holding cruise control setting either - it should be smart enough to realize when you are changing lanes to go around a slower car and relax the allowed distance a bit, and it needs one more setting with a smaller distance. 
5. No reason at all for this not to have Android Auto and CarPlay. None. In a vehicle of this level and price, not having it is not OK.  
6. Very quirky infotainment system. Like a few others, we've had to have ours re-flashed at least twice (and another one coming), due to random shut downs and blinking or blank screens and such. Currently, the talk button to activate voice commands isn't working at all - and when it was, it was quite confusing to use. Sometimes, Bluetooth audio works, sometimes not, sometimes you have to reconnect when turning on the car again. iPod integration is spotty - it wants to somehow reset the indexing each time the car is started, and caused my wife's Nano to freeze up several times in the process.  It should understand higher resolution files than it does on a USB flash drive. Settings menu system is bizarrely organized and everything but intuitive. There are no real apps to speak of, despite it telling you there are places for them. Navigation system is pretty dumb and very dated, with odd routes and nonsensical times to
 arrival. Overall, the infotainment doesn't feel like something in an upscale car - it is almost like we are beta testing a not-quite-fully-implemented system.

Meh:
1. Bose stereo is better than some factory systems but not what it could be, and not as good as hoped. I recognize that I have higher standards than many, but I have not been able to dial in a sound I am fully pleased with. Having said that, the positioning of the stereo image way out in front of the driver is pretty decent.

infiniti,qx50,2019,Deedee, 05/15/2018,Loved this car!,5,"For me, it came down to a choice between the Audi Q5 and the Infiniti QX50.  Didn't test drive either one, but preferred the QX50.  Reason I haven't bought one: Dealer reluctance to negotiate on a price below MSRP and limited availability of Model/Options/Color I prefered.  I don't buy new cars often, so I'll hold off deciding to buy this car until some of the cache' wears off and reliability & performance data become available.

infiniti,qx50,2019,Longtime Infiniti Driver, 10/21/2019,loyal QX50 leaser - till now,1,"We recently leased our 4th QX50 (previously an FX), despite our disappointment with the redesigned 2019 body, which makes the vehicle look more like a bland SUV and less like a sporty cross-over. If only the changes had been visual and nothing else! Here is a list of flaws in the redesign, compared to our prior 3 vehicles of the same model:

- gear shift is slippery. When shifting into Drive, the car often goes into Manual One instead. It also does not reliably shift from Park to Reverse, so you think you're backing up, but you're just gunning the engine.
- variable windshield wiper settings are poorly ""automated,"" and not in the control of the driver. The variable settings are tied to a rain sensor which cannot be over-ridden, and which does not reliably detect rain.
- keyless door entry is fussy. Often times I have to dig into my bag for my key fob, because doors won't open via keyless entry.
- nav screen control knob is poorly positioned. Any time a passenger is holding a bag, pet, or anything in their lap, they inevitably trigger the traffic map into unwanted, distracting settings.
- the ""app"" interface is ridiculous. We all have smart phones. Why not let us plug them in and use those apps in our car, instead of creating a bunch of useless fake Infiniti apps that I will never take the time to learn about?
- the dual screen system is outdated and crude. Why do I need two screens - one for entertainment and one for traffic? It makes the dashboard look crowded; requires split attention; and ignores the fact that we all prefer our smart phone directions app to whatever is on offer from Infiniti.
- gas tank got smaller. Now I have to stop more frequently to gas up.
- and the body redesign isn't just ugly, it's also costly, since parking garages now see the car as a full-sized SUV.

This is our last Infiniti. There are far more attractive options in this class, and we'll be exploring BMW, Mercedes, and Porsche for our next one."
infiniti,qx50,2019,Stephanie Ducram, 04/02/2019,PRETTY IN RED!,2,"I purchased the 2019 QX50 Essential May 2018. I love this vehicle. When we first purchased we had one minor issue with the engine revving up. We took to Palm Beach Infiniti Dealership and had to leave for about 2 weeks until engineer came up with a fix and after that we have not had any problems. We purchased it from Daytona Infiniti and if you live in Florida I would recommend that dealership as they were so nice and accommodating. Palm Beach Infiniti can use a lesson in customer service as they are not as friendly as you would think which is the reason we drove over 3 hours to purchase from Daytona Infiniti. We have taken several long trips to Georgia and have had no issues and the ride was smooth and quiet. Very Comfortable! I had my oiled changed for the first time at 7500 miles and the Assistant Manager Chris Tyson who was my service advisor is very rude and comes across as a snub - never returns phone calls. I am hoping I don't have a lot of issue with vechicle cause I don't like the non-responsiveness of no return phone calls. I would say the only downfall to owning this vehicle is where I have to have it service (Palm Beach Infiniti) since my current interaction has not been pleasant other than that love love love it.

No complaints.,5,"I drove a previous version of the this car (the EX) for almost 10 years and decided it was time for a new one with they changed the body style. I love it. I have the Pure edition. I have owned the car for 1 year and have put 15,000 miles on it. My average gas mileage for that time is 26.5 (premium gas). I have not experienced any of the issues that other reviewers mention. I live in South Florida, but I have never had an issue with the A/C not keeping it cool enough. No gas smell. It handles beautifully and is quiet. It is comfortable for long rides. It has adequate room for a family of four. I plan on driving it for another 9 years. 

Many of the criticisms are about features not available on my trim level. My car does not brake by itself, and it does not have a moonroof.

infiniti,qx50,2019,Average Joe, 12/31/2019,Design Over Practicality,3,"Car performs well but Infiniti made some horrible decisions.

First: This is my first winter with the car in New England and easy access to your wiper blades should be essential and there is nothing easy about it and with the covering as designed you get ice build up on the blades and  area covered by thee hood. 

Second: when you have rain drops on the hood of your car and you slow down / brake for a traffic light a large wry of water flies I to the windshield.  A little intimidating the first time

Third:  A poor decision on engaging the car into neutral with a half up motion to shift.  Again this is awkward when you take it to the car wash.

Fourth: I also have a JX 35 and I will OT buy another Infiniti again

Down side is with 15 months remaining getting rid of it isn’t an option. This car is terrible! If you’re looking to pay luxury pricing for a car that has nothing but problems and you want to spend your life at the dealership then this is for you. Just horrible. Infiniti is terrible to deal with. They want to pretend they’re luxury but they just are not. During the lockdown my vehicle was at the dealership for a month (it’s a year and a half old) because of engine issues, rattles (Infiniti can never resolve this), steering column issues and the driver’s seat needed to be replaced, oh and it needed the entire panoramic roof replaced.

infiniti,qx50,2019,Jerry R, 12/05/2020,Dealer refuses to believe there are problems.,1,I have had constant issues with Bluetooth dropping despite Make and Model is suppose to be compatible.  Settings refer to factory setting every few weeks.  The door sometimes does not unlock via of button on handle but key fob still works.  The screens sometime go blank but return on restarting car.  Electric parking brake sometimes does not release when used while car is running.  Releases if car restarted.  There are other problems but all seem related to electrical or software bugs. Problem is that on taking it to dealer they claim there is nothing wrong.  Fuel mileage is poor compared to Infiniti specs.

The car now has 31,000 miles on it and it is on its third engine, it’s third starter, it’s second battery, and various other repairs. While the bells and whistle‘s are great and when operating the car runs very well it is the least reliable vehicle I have ever owned. All the repairs have been under warranty and the dealership has been great. Unfortunately the car does not meet the Ohio lemon law requirements. Thankfully, the car is only leased so I get to turn it in in a few months. I pity the poor buyer who gets this car after my lease. I’m not a car guy so I don’t know the specifics I was told that the engine was losing compression and that the dealership had never seen that happen before. In the last two years it has probably been in the shop for a total of 50 days. Just this morning the car wouldn’t start again and it’s going in next week. I would think long and hard before buying this vehicle.

We tried over a dozen cars from luxury to large SUV's.  This 2020 QX 50 places more items on it's sleek dashboard and leaves more leg and shoulder room in the cabin of the vehicle.  The power seats have so many adjustments that my husband has as much headroom as in did in our late model Mercedes 450!  The seats are comfy, the technology is sweet, it has Apple Play, blind spot warning, lane warnings and the engine has pep!!  I was used to a 8 cylinder Jeep and Benz and this sweet ride is just as smooth and much easier on the wallet for gas!  It looks small on the outside but don't let that fool you!  The back space is very big and the back seats have a 60/40 split!  Infiniti gives you road service and live traffic for four years.

infiniti,qx50,2020,Bob D, 03/14/2020,GOOD DEAL FOR THE MONEY,5,"My current lease was almost up and I decided I wanted an suv this time around. I liked the look of the QX50 but I didn't like all the poor reviews of the 2019 model on Edmunds. I decided to test drive the 2020 model to see if any of the problems  of the 2019 might have been corrected. I was impressed with the ride and size but really impressed with the power of the new engine. I had no problem with the cvt transmission at low or high speeds. My current car is a three litre 300 twin turbo which I love, yet I see no noticeable differance in power. Yes, I did have a problem with the light steering feel but I changed the setting from standard to sport in the settings option screen and it tightened up to my liking. I really was surprised to like this suv. I live in the city so I never expect good gas mileage from any vehicle and this one is no different. You are always stopping for lights or stop signs so there is just no way you are going to see good mileage. On the highway it's just the opposite. I'm getting almost 30 MPG and the ride is great. The power is very acceptable at any speed. I also found no power lag going up hills which many complained of with the cvt transmission. Many nice features for the money. All in all I'm very happy and surprised with this suv.

We've already taken it up to the cottage and it was dream on both the highway and side roads.  The seats are also so comfortable.  The BOSE stereo system and panoramic roof is also a beautiful touch - it adds a lot of natural light inside the car (my interior is black).  A full tank gets around 600km.

My last car was a Infiniti Q50 Red Sport AWD and in looking for a new car I wanted three main things: lower monthly lease payment, smoother ride and better gas mileage.  With my QX50, I have achieved one, a lower payment.  My car has the 20 inch wheels with those lousy run flat tires and my QX50 is THE WORST RIDING CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED!  I feel every road imperfection with authority and if I drive over any sort of bump, I am met with a loud suspension THUD, the ride in my new car is horrendous.  The ride in my car is so bad that I am going to take it to the dealer to see if something is wrong with the suspension.  The gas mileage is the next problem (of many), I have not put the car in sport mode yet and have been driving very gently as I am breaking the car in an I am getting 19.7 avg MPG??  Really??  I thought the variable compression turbo engine and pathetic CVT was supposed to provide best is class MPG or close to it-NOT.  Now onto the electrical multitude of issues:  sometimes my car locks by pushing button on door handle-sometimes it doesn’t, sometimes my phone pairs to car-sometimes it doesn’t,  sometimes my climate control temp setting and audio channel displays on the lower part of he upper screen-sometimes it doesn’t,  sometimes my lower screen takes forever to load-sometimes it doesn’t, sometimes my saved driver settings per my smart key are there-sometimes I have to reset all of my preferences (yes I am using the same key).Today my lower in-touch control screen never turned on so I had no controls to any electronic functions of the car-no audio, no nav destination input, no climate control display.  The mobile in touch app will not pair with my car.  My upper navigation map screen will turn on-sometimes it doesn’t.  Shall I continue with the problems?  I certainly can...  Again this is my 4th and last Infiniti, I am now actually hoping for more continual problems so I can get lemon law.  But at least I accomplished one of my three goals with a new car, a lower payment.  Man do I wish I would have selected a different manufacturer and model for a higher payment...  Maybe my expectations are too high as I have had the car a month...

infiniti,qx50,2020,KennyD, 09/24/2020,Things I don't like on my QX50,2,"I did not know what run flat tires were when I purchased the vehicle. When I got to the finance person he put the feat of god in me if I did not take the insurance on the the tires & rims. I own the car at that point, so I went to 4 tire shops around town to see if they carry these tires. I was told they could get them but it would take a day or two. You get no spare or jack with the car. If you are on vacation in the country and there is no dealer around plan on staying til the local tire shop finds you one.
The steering on this car is electronic not hydrolytic and is tight and responsive it drifts at high speeds. I wanted to buy the car after the lease but will turn it in because of the tires which are expensive to replace.

infiniti,qx60,2014,Susan Hubbard, 09/13/2015,Dangerous Vehicle!!!,1,"Purchased my QX 60 in June 2014. By the end of July, with approximately 4,000 miles on the car, I had MAJOR transmission problems. The car would jerk and jut, accelerating and decelerating very hard and on its own without my foot on the gas! From that day on until 3 weeks ago I had my car in and out of service every couple of months because of transmission problems they could not diagnose (it has a horrible shutter that jerks the car around). FINALLY, they put an update on my car 13 months after I purchased it and of course it told them to replace the transmission. This is a known problem that service writers, techs and many customers have experienced. 

I had my new transmission in 2 weeks and it did the same thing!!!!  Three weeks after my transmission was replaced they had to put in another. In addition to a horribly built transmission the adaptive cruise control, which maintains a specific distance from the car in front of it while using cruise control is seriously dangerous and life threatening. When a large vehicle, like a semi-truck, passes on the right the vehicle will brake very hard trying to bring it to a stop. When you are driving 80 MPH on the interstate you put your life in your hands because any vehicles following behind have no idea you will brake that suddenly for no reason. Again, this is a known issue with service writers and techs. It can be terrifying to experience. 

I am in the process of working with the state to have Infiniti purchase my car back due to the lemon laws. Wish me luck!

The best I've seen is 22mpg. That was fillup in Seattle, drive I-5 to Portland, turn around and straight back to Seattle. Cruise control the whole way. My regular fill ups are 18mpg. Total crap! Told service Manager at dealership I bought it from. They drove it for a week and they got 19mpg. So we have a problem, right. All the service tests they did showed the car operating optimally. So they called infiniti and we opened a case. infiniti engineer came, drove 51 miles on 1.8 gallons which equaled 28.3mpg. I said how did you do that?

infiniti,qx60,2014,greggnyc, 05/08/2014,Major problem with this car - DO NOT BUY THE HYBRID!!,2,"I bought a 2014 Infiniti QX60 Hybrid two months ago in March 2014.
I immediately noticed that I am getting a combined 15 mpg on the trip computer (not the 25/28 mpg as advertised).

After having the Infiniti dealer (Infiniti Manhasset) tell me there is nothing they can do, I reached out to Infiniti USA.
They asked that I do a manual calculation by tracking how many miles I have driven on the odometer and how many gallons of gas it takes to fill up from the last fill up.
After going through this exercise, the calculation was still right around 15 mpg (15.4 mpg to be exact).
Infiniti USA told me yesterday that there is nothing they can do to help me .
Is anyone else having this problem?"
infiniti,qx60,2014,SCP, 06/14/2018,I will NEVER recommend this vehicle to anyone,2,"I previously owned an FX/35 (now the QX70) and absolutely fell in love with that vehicle.  It was perfect for me...until I began expanding my family and needed more room.  Because I had such a fabulous experience with Infiniti I went back and selected a QX60 because it is a little bigger.  The good news - the fit & finish is great and gas mileage is better than expected.  I drive 70+ miles daily in rush hour traffic & I still average nearly 22 mpg.  The bad news - there is nothing else redeeming about this vehicle or Infiniti Corp.  The battery dies every 18 months like clockwork.  And, as others have stated, within months of purchasing this vehicle (with all of 12 miles on it), I began having horrible transmission problems.  I took it into the service group 7 or 8 times to no avail because it was intermittent and the techs could never duplicate it.  I was to the point of hiring an attorney when Infiniti SUDDENLY developed a 'code' that could detect the KNOWN problem I was having.  Finally, when I took it in, they read the code and BAM - new transmission.  The problem is that I have had bizarre and random hiccups with the transmission since...including a horrible clunking sound when shifting from reverse to drive.  Again, only intermittently so it cannot be easily reproduced.  I was told that, because I had the ""newest version"" of the transmission they would not replace it again.  Infiniti must have received an incredible number of complaints because 4 weeks after I had tried - yet again - for them to recognize the horrid clunking sound, Infiniti released a bulletin that said hearing a horrible clunking sound when shifting from reverse to drive (especially first thing in the morning) is considered NORMAL for this vehicle and had to do with either the motor or the transmission mounts.  That was it for me.  I have sworn off Infiniti and I warn everyone I know to not purchase one.  Unfortunately, in my state I missed my opportunity to sue under lemon laws, but I know I will never make that mistake again.  If I ever encounter similar issues with another vehicle I will immediately hire an attorney and get all of my money back (and my legal fees!).  My favorite part was when they told me they were extending the warranty on my transmission for another 30,000 miles...wait - you mean the transmission you swear is perfectly normal and refuse to address in any way?  Right....that'll do the trick.  Needless to say, I am now in search of a different vehicle and consider the experience a horribly costly life lesson.  DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE IF YOU SEE ONE AT A USED CAR LOT....seriously, don't.

QX60 offered more room, comfort, and better price than the MDX (my opinion).
Hybrid vs non was a difficult decision but with a modest 3k premium, increased MPG, and option packages simplified, we selected the AWD hybrid.
The comfort is unparalleled and the safety is outstanding. The warnings (lane departure, blind spot ect.)/interventions can be individualized, on or off for each driver.
The MPG was concerning after purchasing with 19 city and 23 hwy.
Now with 1500 miles 22 to 23 city and as high as 29 on the highway!
24 for mixed driving.

We have provided video evidence of the problem, but since the dealer's test equipment finds no fault, they refuse to replace any parts or make further adjustments.  The manufacturer sent a technical expert to examine the car, and he agreed with the dealer that without a computer stored fault no action would be taken.  After viewing the several videos, their position remains unchanged.   We have owned BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, Toyota, Chevrolet and Cadilac cars in the recent past, and in all cases have been pleased with warranty support.  This is our first and last Infiniti.

infiniti,qx60,2014,Chicagoland Infiniti Purchaser, 07/22/2016,2014 Infiniti QX 60 Ignition Would Not Shut Off!,1,"I thoroughly researched luxury 3-row SUVs before purchasing a new Infiniti QX 60 vehicle (in the Chicagoland area) in 2014.  The negotiated price was competitive based upon the other SUVs I researched.  The vehicle is comfortable, the interior is nice, and I love the overall look of the vehicle.  But I have had two significant issues with my 2014 QX 60 that would prevent me from purchasing another Infiniti:  (1) an issue with a gas gauge being defective, resulting in the electronic and traditional gas gauges being inconsistent and causing uncertainty as to how much gas was in the vehicle (dashboard removed and circuitry replaced within the first 30 days of owning the vehicle) and (2) an issue with the ignition start/stop button not working, preventing me from being able to turn off the ignition and lights and rendering the windows, door locks, shifter, etc. from being functional (one body control module replaced after diagnostic testing showed an error code between two body control modules).  The second issue resulted in me being stranded at night in the country on a trip with my 5-year-old son, after stopping for gas in a small town without a hotel, car rental agency, etc.  I was unable to leave my vehicle since neither the engine nor the lights would shut off, and a tow truck driver who initially agreed to tow my vehicle later dropped off my son and me in a remote area because he did not deem my vehicle safe to tow.  As the Infiniti customer service person remarked after hearing my story, ""It sounds like a bad movie.""  And yet Infiniti was unable to confirm that the same or further electrical issues will not recur/occur, and Infiniti was unwilling to provide an extended warranty for electrical issues with the vehicle.  The bottom line for me is that the car has experienced problems that I would not expect for a 2014 ""luxury"" vehicle, and Infiniti has been unwilling to stand behind its product by offering an extended warranty for the electrical issues experienced with the vehicle.

Car starting having start up issues on July 2015. Several times a week it would take 3-4 tries to start the vehicle. I presumed it was the battery. At that time they the dealership jump started my battery which they said was still good and told me to drive my car more often. Lol! Then several weeks later problem with starting the car returns. I hold off on bringing the car in until September when the car does not start one morning. Infiniti road service jumps my car and the dealership agrees to replace my battery. Three days later my car stalls twice while driving the car in reverse and the power steering fails while vehicle is in drive. Took the car in the next morning (Monday) and they checked it and said everything seemed fine:( LUCKILY while pulling the car back from the service garage the car stalls for the service technician. At that point I was given a loaner vehicle. During this visit they noticed that a wire was loose underneath the car. I believe it was the body control module wire that was loose. For this visit they really thought they had the problem solved and return the car to me the following day. Four days later the car stalls again while driving and does not starting on the first try. I returned it to the dealership and got a loaner for the second time. During this time they replaced the hybrid battery as well as the key remote battery and they even replaced the new battery just to make sure all batteries were new at the same time. The kept my car for 2 weeks just to be sure it was fixed before returning it to me. Four days later car takes 3 tries to start so I take it directly to the dealership and got another loaner vehicle. During this visit they have been replacing both the hybrid computer and the body control module computer. They have had my vehicle for 3 weeks. The vehicle is still not working so now they think they will replace the harness! Oh and by the way, while the vehicle was at the dealership for 3 weeks parallel parked in an unofficial parking spot in a lot that is overcrowded a delivery truck backs into my vehicle and now the side bumper needs to be replaced. Estimate for damages is 4000 K! I have never has this kind of experience with a car in my life. My first Luxury vehicle is my least reliable car ever.

My first trip a week later, it started stuttering and jerking and jumping upon acceleration. I took it back to the dealer every week for months. Each time they replaced something significant, like the transmission. I think I had 3 or 4 new transmissions. At one point, they replaced the engine. This car was a disaster. In the 6 months I owned it, the dealer had it more often than me and put more miles on it than I did. They called at one point and offered me $1000 to shut up and dismiss my claims. Um, no. After dealing with it for 5 months, the person at Nissan Corporate said she didn't realize my transmission had been replaced so many times. So they bought it back. But charged me for all the miles, most of which had been the result of the dealer driving it or going back and forth to the dealer. Then I got a notice prior to the completion of the buy back (and after they had already told me what they would give me for it) that I should make a payment since the buy back wasn't final.  I financed through NISSAN!!. I made the payment anyway. And sure enough, when I got my check, it was for the original amount and didn't include the payback of my payment. So they tried to pocket that. I appealed it and it took a month or so to get that back. The only people that impressed me about Infiniti were the service people, who REALLY tried.

The rear brakes and rotors failed at 20k miles. It is under-powered, the CVT is annoying, it doesn't get particular good mileage, and the steering response feels like there is a rubber band between the steering wheel and wheels.

Upon purchasing this vehicle the rear differential went out at 50k miles. After replacing the rear differential, I noticed stuttering and poor acceleration in the transmission. I took it to the dealer and they updated the software, but it didn't cure the problem. Long story short, they ended up putting a new transmission in. I have had to replace and entire headlamp because the seals went bad and condensation in the lamp was causing a shortage in the bulb. After they fixed that headlight the driver headlamp suffered the same issue. Went back to the dealer for an oil change, but noticed my engine light on, they discovered that I needed a catalytic converter and a catalytic manifold system!!!!!! This was the WORST car I HAVE EVER OWNED! DO NOT BUY THIS CAR!!! That CVT transmission is garbage!!!!! I can go on and on about repairs and how god awful this car is. Just leave it at the dealership!!!

Counting down til 12/1/2017 to leave this vehicle at the lot! Here are the issues I have had with the 2014 QX 60 and all the times it has been in the service department.

1. Fuel gauge fluctuations. Digital reading would jump all over the place. Did not match the gauge. *Repaired.

• Window stripping replaced around windshield. *Did not fix issue.
• Replaced roof rails. *Did not fix issue.
• Car was returned with gash on driver side door. Sent back for repair.
• **Dad discovered front mud flap had a loose screw which was causing issue.
3.  I  have a rattle in the steering column. It sounds like something is loose inside. 
     *Issue has never been resolved.
4. The driver side sun visor makes a very loud popping noise when you pull it down and push it back up. (Replaced 2 times) 
5. The driver side window making a loud grinding noise. *Issue was fixed.
6. The driver window now has a oily residue  after rolling the window down and back up.
*Cleaned but shows back up.
7. Iphone worked intermittently with car ipod controls. Screen in car would grey out not allowing any functions to be used.  
8. Passenger seat airbag light stays on with passenger in seat. *Checked but no fix.

11. Passenger seat airbag light recall. *Issue fixed.
12. CVT recall. *Serviced.
13. Weather stripping hanging out from roof rails. *Both rails replaced.
14. TV screen stuck and will not release on driver side. Passenger side TV sticks frequently. *Driver side tv replaced.
15. Sunroof has ongoing rattle as well as the steering column. *Sunroof repaired after 2 visits.

Took some adjusting to a more sporty luxury vehicle.
I don't feel like I'm on the ground, seat height is good, not commanding. Ride quality is superb!
CVT transmission took some adjusting, but I have really grown to like the quick drive quality in sport mode. It is plenty fast for me, can't wait to drive it on the expressway each day. Great family vehicle for trips and activities. Loads of room and an airy feel equal to the rover with even more leg room in all 3 rows.

infiniti,qx60,2014,california11, 06/08/2014,Built to perform,5,"I bought the fully loaded QX60 Hybrid Front wheel in March 2014. I enjoy the smooth, comfortable and quiet ride. I just made it to 5000 miles. I mostly drive in a normal mode, shown by the ""dot"" on the dial knob.The city and highway mileage combined gives 26 MPG. For the highway, it gives up to 29 MPG. Look at the MPG bar on the center display panel and learn to drive accordingly to get better MPG. When possible, hit the brakes slowly and see how hybrid

No premium gas needed.
It is not a race car, but if you want to drive that way you can (switch dial to sport mode), may not get best MPG."
infiniti,qx60,2014,crash, 08/26/2015,So far So good,4,"The reviews I've read sound scary!  I haven't owned mine long but I've done a long road trip with it.  Others have mentioned poor gas mileage.  I don't fully disagree, but I've been watching my driving habits and my mileage has been improving.  At first I was getting a combined 16.5 mpg.  My overall average has improved to 21.5  and my last few fill ups were around the 23.5 mpg range.  I now leave it in ECO mostly and switch to sport in city traffic or when I know I'll need more responsive acceleration. 
I haven't had any quality issues yet with trim or paint, but do worry about that as the trim pieces do seem a little fragile or cheap.  

So, I am concerned based on other reviews.  But, so far I LOVE this car.  It is very quiet which is important to me.  Its a very smooth ride too, also important.  I just returned from a 7 day, 2700 mile road trip and I find the car to be very comfortable.  I bought this car used, and had planned on buying the Audi Q7, but was having difficulties finding the right used one at the right price and then drove this and loved it.  I should mention that the one I bought came with all the packages, and I'm very pleased with all the features, especially the adaptive or intelligent cruise control.  

So, so far I'm very happy, and hopefully I won't have some of the problems others mention.

We would be completely satisfied except for one major flaw- rattles are abound in every corner of the vehicle. Within about 1,000 miles, the doors started rattling.

Whoever wrote the review about the car being ""sluggish"" or handling sluggishly obviously drove a different car than this one.
This QX60 has excellent acceleration getting on freeways and it is incredibly well designed from a space utilization standpoint and for comfort of driver and occupants.
The ride is also more quiet than any of the competitors we tested.

The controls on the dash are far inferior to many lower priced vehicles and the capabilities are inferior to most SUV's on the road.    The 2014 dash has since been replaced but Infinity continues to complicate controls, limit the range of controls and fails to connect the user the ways many other vehicles can.   The ride is extremely noisy for a ""Luxury"" brand, the features are far less than other manufacturers and I'm very disappointed with my purchase.  I'd suggest looking at other options unless a SUV is with limited features is what is needed.   The cabin is roomy and comfortable but that is where my positive reviews will end.

infiniti,qx60,2014,qx60driver, 04/19/2015,QX60 is not for everyone,4,"After driving a G35 for 13 years, it took a bit to get use to QX60 Hybrid. It is perfect  when you drive the wife, 2 kids and their stuff. And you still have room to offer another family to come alone. Or like me, you do not remember when was your last speeding ticket. My last one was 17 years ago. I know we need a minivan but can not imagine being seen in one. QX60 fits the bill, plus the 4WD. 
I enjoy seeing 26 to 29 mpg routinely with regular gas. My record is a 38.1 mpg on a short 10 mile run. 
Having kids changed my perspective. I no long focus on 0-60 numbers. Someday,  I will have my sports car with no child seats.

I also got 17 mpg when try to match my G35 experience.

Update, April 3rd, 2016. 
27,000 + miles later, QX60 Hybrid runs well.  Overall, I am at 25.5 mile/gallon, I did manual calculation for 12 month driving, recording miles at each gas fill up. 
I drive highway 70 miles during the week, and all local during weekends. 

Before QX60, we always take my wife's ML350. Now, kids just go to QX60, it is so comfortable and roomier. 
No issue, not a single one. I did oil and filter changes myself every 5000 miles with full synthetic. I do not go to dealer for services, other than tire rotation. 

My next car is either a 911, GT-R or Tesla Model S, keep on dreaming while driving +/- 5 miles within speed limit in my QX60.

Roof rail was improperly installed (missing clip) and the passenger front door has a paint run.
Also rear passenger door seal plastic was put on wrong (cracked).

I brought it to the attention of the dealer who said it was how the car was designed and that the doors are ""heavy"" and ""safe"" and that's why this was happening.
I called Infiniti Consumer Affairs as well, and have not gotten anywhere with them either. I was told I could break my lease for $1500.

 Little things have been happening - rubber molding sticking out from the rear passenger door and the seat belt on the passenger seat was installed backwards.

The quality of the exterior is no where near the Lexus and I've been having a problem with the driver's mirror moving after the car is turned off.

However, the dash rattles, and the back passenger panel lost a clip and is just getting looser. The dealership says they can’t fix it. They want me to take it to a body shop even though it happened on its own. I had some stuttering for awhile while driving. Kind of a chugging feeling. The did an update on the software and it seems to have fixed it. Today the lift gate wouldn’t open. I tried multiple times and finally got it to open but the car had to be on and only the dash button worked. I tried the additional key fob and same thing. Then about an hour later it worked fine. I fear this is just the beginning of some electrical issues and I worry about the cost. Although it’s nice, the technology in the car is significantly lacking compared to other lesser cars. For a luxury vehicle, you would expect too if the line. While I love the look of the Infiniti. I don’t see myself purchasing another.
"
infiniti,qx60,2014,D.B., 07/30/2015,Worst purchase decision EVER!,2,"Very disappointed in this purchase. Upgraded from a Honda Oddessey and I regret this decision wholeheartedly. IT IS THE ROUGHEST RIDE EVER AND INCREDIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE. I didn't realize how horrific the ride is while test driving because that is usually a quick ride. I am constantly yelling at my husband to stop driving like a maniac but am realizing it must be the car'mechanics or suspension. Either way, I dislike the feel and comfort of the car more and more everyday. I recall it driving slightly smoother the first 3 months we had it and now 10 months in, we're all bouncing out of the seats. My kids really dislike riding in the back seats. (I feel terrible because they weren't with us when be test drove it.) 

The engine is getting louder by the day. I don't care for the way this car shifts gears. Seems love it revs up very high before finally settling into the right gear.

The lift hate is rusted underneath the chrome panels. It is currently in the body shop getting replaced. Let me remind you the car isn't even a year old yet!

The temperature is never just right; either too hot or too cold. The back seat vents are sparse which is likely the reason for the fluctuation in temperature. 

I'm getting roughly 18.2 mpg but do travel frequently.

15k mile ""recommended service"" is $450+. 

Ray Catena's complimentary car wash is a joke. Very sloppy on the cleaning overall. My car still had sticker residue on the outside after a few washed by the dealer. I took it to a car wash and paid for the job to be done right. It was like night and day.

Overall very disappointed. Should have gone with the MDX.

infiniti,qx60,2014,qxcouldbbetter, 02/24/2014,city mpg rating is a sham,5,"Update Feb-2018:
I love this car. After years of use, it remains reliable and beautiful utility vehicle.  No issues with car since purchase (except for paint).  I did find a body shop that does amazing paint repair for a third of dealer fee.  So far, spent $540 to completely repaint two doors due to two bad door dings. after more than 4 years, the car looks like new.  Kids love this car as well and prefer it over other vehicles we have.

Update Feb-2016:
its been over two years since purchase.  happy overall.  MPG is still a scam (more findings below).  automated highway driving is scary!
quality of switches, leather, seats, handles, screens are high and so far no issues
paint is holding out pretty well but i do have a single chip where car's door hit my door.  its been there for ~ 1.5 years and hasn't got worse (no rust).  scratches are minimal (inside door handle dips, and single light scratch on door)
MPGs for my drivers average to ~ 22MPG (80% highway / 20% city) - this is with 20"" wheels, towing kit, ECO mode all the time.  the 22MPG is with air conditioner on.  turn off air conditioner, MPG goes up to 25.3!!! WTF - ~15% difference?!  most of my driving REQUIRES air conditioner due to weather so this is a big issue.
automated highway driving - if there is a large obstruction in middle of highway, the car not sense it and plow right into it.  its only when there is a moving object (vehicle) in front, when the car senses the manages acceleration/brakes.  if this is important to you, look into new models or other vehicles.

~Jan-2014:
I've had the qx60 hybrid and for about 3 mo now, 2300 miles.
If I knew how poorly hybrid performs in the city (supposed to be hybrid vehicle strength) I would not have gone for hybrid.

Let me repeat this, the car is great! Lots of room, great safety features, but I want my money back for ""hybrid"" part. City mpg of 25 is nowhere to be found, no matter how slow or fast acceleration, ease of breaking, Ac/no ac, no matter what I tried.
I max out around 15mpg on a good day around city and hit as low as 9mpg occasionally without trying.

Infiniti, I hope you are listening and are not going to drop your customers now that we have given you the money.

Takes a little getting used to on turns because it's a little long. You just have to think about your back tires during the turn and you've got it. Otherwise no problem with handling.

infiniti,qx60,2014,Will, 12/03/2019,The ups and downs of total ownership,2,"I owned the QX60 Hybrid AWD for 5 years and put 70,116 miles on the vehicle. For the first 4 years 6 months of my ownership I would have bought Infiniti's for the rest of my life based upon that experience. The last 6 months was a nightmare. It started with the safety systems going nuts. The car started breaking on its own on the highway. This lead to the vehicle being in and out of the dealer repair shop over the final 6 months of ownership. The dealer said there as a leak in the manifold and that could have caused some of the craziness which didn't and still doesn't make any sense. So under warranty the dealer replaced the manifold. 3 days later I was back at the dealer with the same issue. This time they said they had to replace the transmission this repair took 2 months. fortunately i was given a courtesy car. finally after the transmission replacement I noticed that my 24-30MPG vehicle was getting 16mpg. This was the final straw, I took the vehicle back to the deal where they told me I should get a new mass air flow sensor which cost $650 dollars and that MAY solve the MPG issue. This was completely unacceptable. I really think the hybrid battery went bad and they didn't want to test or replace that particular part. A 60k crossover with all the tech and comforts a person could ask for but ultimately not a vehicle that lasts.

infiniti,qx60,2014,Darren, 03/08/2020,2014 Infiniti QX-60,3,"We purchased this car used, for $27,500.00 Canadian. We have had it a year and a half. I don’t drive the car that much, as it’s my wife’s car. We took it for a long drive and I noticed that the car was shuttering down the highway. I called the dealer and booked an appointment to have it checked out. The car has less than 120,000 kms and after an inspection, they told me the valve body, need to be replaced in the CVT transmission. Infiniti extended there warranty until 150,000kms. So, we didn’t have to pay anything. I have many many Nissan products over the years. The Nissan Frontier is one of the most reliable vehicles on the road. I love there 2005-2012 Pathinder. Which is really a shame. Because I loved the drive in this Qx-60. But after that, I went to trade it in and the dealer doesn’t rant it either. They told me, that Nissan is going away from the CVt transmission, as it been a disaster. I don’t really want to keep the car, as I’m worried about how long this transmission will last. Too bad.

infiniti,qx60,2014,Grass Valley Guy, 04/13/2020,Six years in with no regrets.,5,"I bought this car in Feb 2014 and have not had any problems with it. After reading all of the horrible reviews of it, I thought that I had better let others know that this has turned out to be a very nice car for me. Good power, all around camera is very helpful, adaptive cruise control works very well, and the gas mileage has been great for such a large vehicle. I usually get in the mid to upper 20s even when I'm pushing 70+ on the freeway.
I was a bit afraid about the light colored interior soiling easily but that hasn't been the case. It cleans up nicely and still looks brand new. Nav system is fine although I did buy a kit that allows me to bypass the restriction on using it fully while the car is in motion.
Sensors all work very well and the cameras have good clarity. I have not had to replace the battery after six years although every couple of months or so I do put a trickle charger on it to keep it in tiptop shape.

This is the perfect travel vehicle...very comfortable on our frequent 720 mile round trips to our second home.  We really love this car after an accident on the interstate yesterday with an 18 wheeler.  The tractor trailer lost control when the driver locked his brakes and he slid sideways into us at 60 MPH.  My husband said the Infiniti was steady, rock solid and he was able to maintain control until we got away from the tractor trailer,and come to a safe stop.  The whole right side of the QX60 will need to be replaced, but we are all OK.  Love my QX60!
"
infiniti,qx60,2015,Yomomu, 12/19/2017,I actually drive it,5,"I have read that others have issues with the seating.  I've read that the CVT is an acquired taste.  I've read that others get lousy fuel mileage.  I've read the car is sluggish. Not sure of any of that.  I think the seating is comfortable, maybe the head rests could tilt backwards a bit more.  I have NO issues with the CVT.  Unlike some of the newer cars with 8-9 gears, the CVT ""shifts"" (fake) very comfortably and it is very, very smooth.  I get mid 20's gas mileage on regular fuel on the highway, better than my M and better than my Hyundai Santa Fe.  I don't think the car is sluggish at all, I've had plenty of passing power and it is very responsive in Sport mode if that is what you are looking for.  What I think this car does best is act like a relatively large SUV from a functional perspective yet performs well enough to be your daily driver without getting bored.  Stereo is good, not as good as my M but decent enough for an SUV.  Interior is really nice.  It is an absolute joy in snow and ice, better than my old Mitsubishi Montero, and that's saying something.  I really like the heated steering wheel - weird, I didn't even thing about that when I bought it.  No issues with reliability at 20K miles, though that's not many miles, still no maintenance issues except scheduled.  I've had several Infiniti's - none of them have had reliability issues.  I don't really expect any in this vehicle.  I've got one rattle in the passenger door that goes away when the car heats up.  For a big car, very solid.  Test drove MDX, Pilot, Highlander, Enclave.  This car was the highest price but was on par with others on lease.  Would have considered the Highlander if it had a little more panache.  MDX nice but not as functional and new tranny was abrupt.  Couldn't get used the not having something to lean my arm on in the Pilot and the radio kept going in and out on the test drive.  No way on the Enclave - its a minivan and a drone to drive though the interior is nice.  I say buy it, you won't regret it.   Both my wife and I enjoy driving the Q, my wife maybe a little more than even me.
"
infiniti,qx60,2015,mkgcmc, 08/10/2015,Upscale Family Hauler for the Minivan-Averse,4,"Three years ago, my wife and I were looking for a premium/luxury three-row crossover to help avoid the minivan stigma. We cross-shopped the QX60 and the Acura MDX heavily, but in the end, the Infiniti was more family-friendly, felt more upscale for the price, and had a far better dealer experience. As we approach the end of our lease, our opinion hasn't changed much. The QX60 is still a nice, upscale, family-friendly vehicle, and a great value when you consider real-world selling prices. Being able to tilt the second row with a car seat attached to get to the third row is invaluable for anyone with three children in car seats - I'm shocked that it's still the only luxury crossover on the market with this feature. 

That said, the infotainment and overall interior are definitely looking dated - Infiniti made some updates to both in 2017, but nothing has changed significantly. We still mostly have the M interior from a decade ago. We still have ugly, yellow, halogen interior lighting on a $50,000 luxury vehicle. We still have Nissan buttons everywhere. For those cross-shopping something like the XC90 or even the CX-9, the interior may come off as a bit of a hard sell during a test drive.

It's only when you take the QX60 on a long drive with multiple kids in the car that you can appreciate how quiet and comfortable the interior is, especially on the highway. It's why we still have the QX60 our our short list for our next crossover - and that really says it all.

Pros:
- Extremely quiet and smooth, particularly on highways
- Leases much better than its MSRP suggests
- Second row can move for third row access even with a child seat installed
- Excellent third row that is usable by adults (at least for short trips)
- Cost to own/lease should be low - you can use Nissan dealers for scheduled maintenance at a lower price

Cons:
- Dated interior design and infotainment system
- City/mixed gas mileage isn't great - we never got close to the EPA average (this has been improved in the 2017 refresh)
- Headlights are weak (this has not changed in the refreshes, even though they look better)
- Slightly more jarring than expected on potholes given the class of vehicle
- Nissan-esque packaging of options (a hands-free liftgate requires a $7,500 package? Come on...)

infiniti,qx60,2015,Deb Slaughter, 05/12/2016,"So far, extremely satisfied",5,"We test drove the MDX, Pilot and Highlander but the ride, look and features of the QX60 sold us. We are and have been Honda/Acura owners and currently own a Ridgeline and love it, but decided to venture out and go with the QX60. The MDX didn't feel as roomy and the two screens and the touch features were overkill for us. The third row seating in the QX60 felt roomier too. I like the 360 degree camera, blind spot warning system, driver seat memory and  bluetooth connectivity - incoming phone calls are very clear! The interior combination of leather, wood and brushed metal accents are spot on. However, it has been less than a month, so perhaps a bit too soon to rate it but, so far, we have absolutely no regret and simply love it!

infiniti,qx60,2015,VM, 12/15/2015,"Great Value, Comfort and Technology",5,"Owned for less than a month, loving it so far. Roomy inside and stylish on the outside. I researched for 4-5 months before deciding on QX60. The other consideration was Acura MDX 2016. I test drove both for about 2 hours in multiple visits and finally decided on QX60.

Things I did not like in Acura MDX:
- Third row seating is not as comfortable as QX60
- The 9-speed transmission is an overkill - it shifts really hard in the traffic and kind of overkill
- The interior felt not as luxury as QX60

Things I like about QX60
- Very comfortable ride, sports mode for the time when you want to a bit more acceleration and road feel
- Comfortable third row seating
- Luxurious interior 
- Less price for the comparable options on MDX
- 360 degree camera with birds eye view is really good

Things I wished worked better
- the back wiper is not rain sensing
- lots of things in the navigation and phone controls cannot be operated when car is in motion even by the front passenger 
- the thigh support is less than Odyssey and MDX
- MPG is not that great, I get about 17.5-18.0 with premium fuel

infiniti,qx60,2015,Rebecca Lowell, 10/14/2015,Love the fancy features!,5,"I drove the same minivan for the past 10 years, so maybe I'm easily impressed - but the bells and whistles are fantastic! In some ways, it's almost like a self driving car. It alerts you when you get too close to someone, and the auto braking is amazing. There is no excuse if I ever rear-end someone! The parking assist with the birds eye view is fantastic. Lots of space in the third row for passengers, but not much cargo space when the seats are full. The gas mileage is not what I expected - fluctuates so far (under 1000 miles on the car) between about 18-22. Right now it says 20.3 average; which is a long way from the 26 advertised. I am driving in the regular mode, I felt the Eco mode, where you can probably get 26 mpg, was very sluggish. I was committed to buying a hybrid and there are very few that seat 7. This was my favorite by far, and I'm very happy with my purchase.

infiniti,qx60,2015,Novanmom, 07/14/2015,Minivan Convert,5,"After almost 5 years of owning a minivan (which we loved), our family has happily returned to an SUV. I thought I'd miss the creature comforts of a minivan, such as its sliding doors and the full 3 rows. But, I'm enjoying the driving experience in our new 2015 QX60 far more.  This crossover is functional, has a plethora of safety equipment and gives you at least a taste of the Infiniti driving experience (we have a 96 I 30 that still runs like very well).The interior is very functional, but practical and is pretty intuitive. Despite the clamping about the CVT transmission, ours has been pretty smooth so far. I LOVE all of the safety features and technology and I am already spoiled to the multi view cameras.  All in all, I am pleased with the vehicle. It offers good quality for the cost and my minivan is slowly but surely becoming a find but distant memory. My line gripe is gas mileage. The QX69 is a bit thirstier than the Odyssey.
"
infiniti,qx60,2015,STJHouston, 03/08/2017,Infinite a GREAT surprise and hidden gem.,5,"For the past 15 years, I've been in the German Luxury lines of BMW and Mercedes exclusively.  I never wanted to own a Japanese car, even the so called luxury brands.  I must say I was a snob in that regard.  THis go round I was looking to get a 7 passenger car and wanted to spend less on my monthly lease.  I knew that I would have to go outside my typical manufacturers to the dark side and venture into the Japanese lines.  I decided I'd look at everything to make the best decision.  We started with the Highlander, which would have been good but it wasn't luxury enough for me.  Then we went to Lexus and the GX is more like a truck and the third row was right against the back with ZERO cargo room.  It was also hard to get into the back, very small opening to climb into the back.  Next was Infiniti.  Wow, was I surprised.  Who knew that I could get it all with an Infiniti!!  I'm in love!!  IT has everything I could ask for.  The luxury, the technology, the best third row option in this sized vehicle. IT's not that big to drive or park!  I'm in love with my car which is why I wanted to post this for anyone looking at 3 row cars.  This is better than the Acura overall. I liked the Acura too but decided that I liked the interior and exterior much better than the MDX but the MDX was a close second.  I also drove the Tahoe and it just felt blah in the area of luxury plus it's too big for my needs.  The QX60 is perfect if you have the need to occassionally take 7 people and the extra people that we take are usually college kids that are still skinny to fit in the back very comfortably.  It's a great car and we had a super easy experience at the dealership too.  Highly recommend Infiniti!!!

Comes with 3rd row seat, which when folded down give more than adequate cargo space. Comes loaded with technology inside and out. From headlights, to sound system, to automatic  open and lift trunk gate, to back up camera and blind spot warning technology. It all equals a great buy and great driver experience.

infiniti,qx60,2015,Neal, 01/14/2018,"It's a people-hauler, not a sports car",4,"Bought it used at 20k miles, now more like 50k (several long roadies this year with the kids, typically I drive more like 12k/yr).  I've read about peoples' issues with the screen, seats, etc., but have not experienced any of that.  I did a lot of comparison shopping before buying.  I looked at the MDX (smaller, less cargo, feels cheaper inside to me - and,  I don't care about a ""sporty"" crossover), the Q7 (also smaller feeling to me - I'm 6'3"", 3 bills, picture your favorite NFL center, was a little nicer inside but also more $, and I read a by lot of poor reliability reviews on the Audi, so it was out), and the BMW X5 (smaller, just generically didn't like the way it looked or felt, again for more $).  In the end, the Infiniti was larger, smoother, more comfortable (my family of four has done 15 hours of roadie in it with our gear, and it was a breeze, very comfortable), well appointed (although I'm still figuring out the need to adjust the angle of the headlights, that seems a little bit overkill), gas mileage is decent (I tend towards ~19 in town/commuting, more like ~29-30 on the highway), and I do wish Nissan would get their tech act together, but that's not a show-stopper for me.  So in the end it's a very competent people-hauler, feels good, looks good, plenty of room, and in this bracket of vehicle it was by comparison cheap.  I would acknowledge that I haven't experienced any of the electrical or build problems you may see in other reviews, though - if I had, I might not be so happy.

 Overall it is a good hauler and an upgrade for Boston roads but the CVT is an acquired taste. I am still wondering if I made the right choice with this rig, but other than a refined transmission and a few more horses underhood perhaps, I'd be happy to do it all over again..

Nearly three years on and 100, 000 miles later, the CVT box of tricks is probably its best attribute once you master its operation dynamics. 
Cabin noise is a little intrusive but not overbearing.
This rig burns various bulbs with more frequency than a stop light🤣
Major repairs have included :
Transfer Case
Rear Diff
Steering Rack
Entertainment Center replacement.

This is a great comfort volume hauler that competes with the best of them and for your peace of mind i’ll Caution against skimping on the EXTENDED “FACTORY WARRANTY,  If it is available

infiniti,qx60,2015,wgj, 08/17/2018,Best choice in this category!,4,"If you want a roomy, stylish, reliable, comfortable luxury SUV then this should be strongly considered.   When we compared the QX60 to everything else it was an easy decision.  No other choice gave us all of the above at this price point - and the lease deal on the 2015 model, after negotiation,  was very reasonable.  While I'd still choose this car again, there are(and maybe have been already) needed improvements.  The front seats seem too hard for long hauls and you feel it!  There is a very suttle engine vibration which I noticed the 2016 model had improved engine mounts to address.  Other than that it is mostly solid.  You can get much better mileage by paying attention to the driving modes - sport for around town and climbing and standard or economy for cruising.  This car will get up and go if you ask it so I disagree with the critics regarding sluggish acceleration.  It handles very well considering the size with decent steering and braking.   It is very quiet at speed and mostly a smooth ride.  Had a 2012 FX35 prior and it was just way to stiff and uncomfortable for most driving conditions.  The Qx60 is a much softer ride!

infiniti,qx60,2015,NH MOM, 09/05/2017,"For all with a new infiniti qx60, I say JUST WAIT!",2,"I love my Infiniti.  What I do not love is the CVT transmission.  I bought the car (LOADED by the way) in April 2015.  We have certainly had our issues along the way, but BY FAR, the biggest issue is the CVT transmission.  It started after we had a transfer case FAILURE, but I won't go into the story.  My car started to have a vibration around 30/40 MPH when trying to stay at a constant speed.  If you do a lot of local driving like I do, you are in this constant speed mode a lot.  The dealership says they cannot 'replicate' the problem.  It gets worse, and since I drive a lot, I am in the dealer about once a month for an oil change.  EVERY MONTH I complain.  Every month, they cannot replicate it.  The last time in, I was set to leave it for life.  They got the service manager and he drove it with me in the car.  He told me that he would contact their area rep and he would come sometime later in the month (August) and we would all go out for a drive, but that his opinion is the 'definitive' opinion.  In other words, he would come out and tell me they cannot replicate it.  So August has come and gone.  My husband called the service manager three times and has not had the courtesy of a return call.  So we have been doing research.  This CVT engine has been a real problem for Nissan.  There is a class action suit for the earlier version CVT .  I think they may have changed some part of the CVT, but I am now deathly afraid to put my children in this car.  Did I mention I have 65K miles...yes, I drive a lot and we travel.  There is a rumor the new 2018 will have a different transmission.  I have been reading online how Nissan North America is not at all helpful.  As I said, love the car, but I cannot safely live with this transmission.  If I hear 'replicate' one more time, I will scream.  They use it for everything.  I had a noise in the fan area for ac/heat.  Can't replicate.  MY HUSBAND took it in THE NEXT WEEK, and all of a sudden, there was a new something needed.  My service advisor told me that Nissan doesn't care about customers, they just want to make a profit.  How about that?

The QX60 is bar far the worst vehicle we have ever owned.  Our VW Routan minivan, which we traded for this car,  was much more comfortable. The primary issue is the seating.  While the materials used is satisfactory, the seating is incredibly uncomfortable, particularly on the front passenger seat.  Anyone with even very mild back issues will be unable to ride in the car for any length of time.  The problem is that test driving it will not allow you to realize the problem.  After about forty minutes of driving, however, the problem is more than noticeable.  In addition, the rear camera is the worst I have ever seen in any car.  It does not provide a clear image.   At night, the image is bright and incomprehensible.  The only real warning when using the rear camera is the sensor, which does work adequately.  In addition, there are multiple rattle is the dash which the dealer has yet to eliminate, which adds to the frustration. Perhaps I have been spoiled by other upper end cars, but this car falls woefully short of what it is portrayed to be. I think many are impressed because of the badge. I now realize the real reason Infiniti gives such a good deal on this car.  Ours has only 5,500 miles and we are trying to get out of it, even though we know we will take a financial hit. If you have an urge to buy this car, conquer it.  Buy an Acura MDX or Audi Q7 instead.  Even an Acadia or Explorer are far superior vehicles. So, too, probably, are Hyundais or Kias.

Con - most unreliable car i have own since my camaro in the 90s.  so many things had to be replaced, small and big ticket items. basically a lemon, everything from interior trim falling off to drivetrain needing to be replaced. after the 2nd yr, non stop breakage. loud screeching noise now because engine fan needs to be replaced for 1K.  this noise started periodically after a yr but because i didn’t resolve it then no longer under warranty.  the noise is intermittent so not easy to diagnose. many other things along the way were covered under warranty.

I had been driving a 2011 Toyota Sienna that had over 140,000 miles on it and felt it was time to start looking for a new car.  Prior to that car I leased three other minivans...two Honda and another Sienna.  It was time to move on from the minivan, however I still needed a true third row to have teenage kids sit in from time to time as well as ample cargo space.  Most of the other three row SUV's have a joke of a third row that is only meant for someone under ten years old.  I test drove the AUDI Q7 and although it's a beautiful car, the third row wasn't nearly as accessible or large as this one and to get all of the equipment I got in the QX60 it would have cost more than $15,000 more.  The same story for the Mercedes and the BMW with the BMW having the smallest third row.  I considered the Toyota Highlander, and although that is a very nice car with ample room, it's just not nearly as luxurious as the Infiniti QX60, and is quite sparce with the interior details.  I even considered the new Honda Pilot fully loaded, until I read all of the Edmunds reviews, and that car for now is a load of trouble.  Plus again, it just wasn't as luxurious as this car.  
The styling of the QX60 is beautiful.  The 2016 interior has been tweaked and is now really beautiful.  I had looked at the 2015 a few months earlier and didn't love the interior which was why it initially fell off of my short list.  When the 2016 came out I revisited the car, and the decision became clear. 
Technology - the technology is extremely user friendly.  Everything is intuitive and so easy to learn.  The voice command system actually works and understands what you are saying.  So many of the other cars I test drove did not.  The navigation is equally easy to use and prompts you early enough to make the system easy to follow.  The sound system is outstanding.  I think they told me it's a 13 speaker BOSE system.  It fills the car beautifully with music.  
I did get the top of the line model with every bell and whistle available.  The new safety features this car has are awesome as well.  I love the road departure feature and the cross traffic alert.  The car comes with a ton of outside cameras which is super useful as well when parking.  I can actually look at the side camera view with the touch of one button and see if my car is too close or far from the curb if I am parallel parking or even parking in a regular space.  
I love that the car came equipped with heated seats (front and rear) and A/C seats in the front.  The A/C seats really works quickly and makes it so comfortable to drive when you get into a hot car.  
Interior - Plenty of storage space.  I wanted a large center console and this one has a two level console which houses everything but in an organized manner.  The glove compartment is equally huge.   The second row is adjustable front and back and the seats recline as well.  The third row seats recline as well which makes you feel like there is more room if you are sitting in third row.  If you are a tall adult you probably wouldn't want to go on a really long trip, but an hour or so would be no big deal to sit back there.  Behind the third row there is a hidden compartment underneath to store a few things as well.  
Overall this car is the perfect fit for me.  It gives me everything I was looking for...a luxurious vehicle that I can really enjoy whether driving alone or toting the kids all over in.

infiniti,qx60,2016,Sergio, 08/01/2016,Great SUV,5,"After debating between the 2017 MDX and the 2016 QX60, it is definitely clear to see who the winner is. Infiniti blew us away with the use of getting to the third row and the amount of legroom in the third row compared to the MDX. I also liked what features were available on the QX60 than compared to the MDX, as the QX60 had more practical features for a vehicle in this segment in packages that made more sense than it did in the MDX. For example, the around view monitor, heated steering wheel, and USB ports in the third row require the highest level package from Acura, while Infiniti has these features offered in its mid-level package. Additionally, the service that the Infiniti dealership gave us compared to Acura was another reason to go with the QX60; I feel more at ease for any services in the future.
"
infiniti,qx60,2016,Sudhir, 07/26/2016,Luxury Family SUV,5,"I bought the 3.5 AWD with all Packages except the Theatre package which I found not really useful considering we are in the age of iPads and Tablets. I test drove  2016 Acura MDX but didn't like the bland interior, button gear selector and the low driving position. For the QX60 I got the Hermosa Blue with Wheat and it looks gorgeous!!! The styling of the 2016 Model looks way more stylish and sportier than the 2015 model. The 2016 also drives a lot smoother and feels quicker off the block. The sport mode is a blast and I am amazed at the ease with which this huge car can get going on the freeway and pass other cars. The surround view 360' camera is awesome and makes parking this huge vehicle a breeze. The interior in whet stands out and adds to the overall pleasure of driving. The back and rear seats are very spacious though could have done with better lateral support.  Just love the remote start feature and helps cooling the car ahead in hot summer days.  Navigation is pretty awesome in the sense that it is simple to use and doesn't go overboard in terms of tech. All the buttons and knobs are easy to use and can be used even when the vehicle is in motion (as against the Pilot where this is restricted). Overall I am very pleased with this car and enjoy spending time inside it. Would very much recommend to anyone looking out for a Luxury 3-row crossover."
infiniti,qx60,2016,Jay, 10/11/2017,Awesome 3 row SUV,5,"We shopped extensively before choosing QX60 (BMW, Audi, Mercedes, Acura). Important buying criteria: 3 row, 7 seat luxury SUV that is comfortable, heated steering wheel (live in Boston area), blind spot detection, easy access to third row and can seat  adults in the third row comfortably.  Audi and BMW third row is a check box (not really usable), Mercedes (probably best in class but reliability concerns, twice as expensive as QX60). We owned several Acuras (TL and RL), but we preferred QX60 over the MDX (third row not as comfortable as QX60).  We bought the extended warranty (10 yr, 150K bumper to bumper) for ~$2K. We really like the QX60, very comfortable to drive, luxurious with fantastic technology (Premium, Premium+ and Assist package).
"
infiniti,qx60,2016,Jose Quezada, 06/19/2016,Excellent Choice,5,"Overall good ride and good safety features.  The 360 degree view offer great assistance for parking.  The new transmition system is so good that you can hardly notice the gears shifting.
"
infiniti,qx60,2016,Bhavya, 09/29/2016,"improved looks and handling, space in infotainment",5,"I just bought this SUV a month ago with delux technology w/ theater and I am very impressed overall. Handling improvement is noticeable and all the active safety works really great. Blind spot intervention helped me once in a bad situation when I was not focusing 100% due to my toddler.  On the downside, infotainment looks old and all aroundview carmera are low resolution, even the rearview camera. Small road imperfections are not hidden by suspension and felt by all passengers.

infiniti,qx60,2016,ZEB Aurangzeb, 10/13/2018,Not a Luxury Brand!,1,"Was a few grand cheaper than Lexus, BMW and Audi with all options which should have been a standard in a luxury car!
Should have gone for Lexus or Audi - Big waste of Money!!
I have owned German cars mostly BMW and Audi. 
Going for a Japanese luxury was a big mistake - maybe should have gone for Lexus!!
I have owned the car for more than 2 years with 28k miles.
Constant increasing annoying Rattles and Noises: 
It rattles from day one and the dealer west Houston Infiniti is not able to resolve the issue.
Not a luxury or performance car ride:
(Honda Odyssey drives far better!)
The car has a hard ride (not a luxury one). 
Under powered and bulky handling...very disappointing.
The car constantly is wobbly and unbalanced - have paid and gotten tires balanced so many times I still don’t feel safe in it.
Have given it 2years and 28000 miles and have reached the conclusion.
Infiniti just dresses up their nissan line up but there is no performance comfort or luxury traits in it. Will not be buying another eve again!!"
infiniti,qx60,2016,Ava, 05/25/2017,Soccer Mom Needs More Assistance,3,"My QX60 has the tech package with all bells and whistles.  The safety features are (tops) especially with my precious cargo.  While I am suppose to be able to listen to my entertainment while the kids have their CD movie going I have not been able to make that happen.  So my music is missing when they are in the car.  Plus, my height is short so the seat adjustment could have gone another notch toward the roof for me.  A cushion would work.  But, defeats the look of the QX60 interior and gets in the way of storage when another driver takes over.  The rear seats passengers... their view to the entertainment screens I need to adjust/remove the headrests to be out of the way so third row passengers can view the screens.  DUMB SET UP.  Also, the driver headrest makes my head tilt forward.  With a screen in the headrest it can not be turned around for my pleasure to make sitting straighter for my posture.  The GPS I can not delete the total history out of our QX60 from the previous owner.  Took my QX60 into shop asking why the heaters do not work in third row.  It took five mechanics.  They don't know will have to get back to me!  DA!, There is only air conditioning to the third row.  NO HEAT!  I did my own digging to find this out!  Never heard back from the guys at Mechanicsburg, PA Infiniti Dealership so they stopped their digging.  (Plus, My son checked out my car's vin # at his employer.  Told me my car had been in an accident to the left driver's side.  Dealership never revealed to me when selling it!  There goes my resale value!  Will never go back there again! Just thought I would share some items that were not previously mentioned in the other reviews to help future customers.  The sensor for automatic braking allows for way too much distance of the vehicle in front of you this can create serious rear situations when it wants to bring you to a complete stop when turning from a main road into a busy shopping mall.  Possible rear end collisions to your car.  I turn it off and just drive defensively at times.  Oh, and never totally just rely on reverse cameras.  Be alert drivers out there!  I think Ford and Volvo are springing ahead of this make!

infiniti,qx60,2016,Almatti, 09/11/2016,EXCELLENT FAMILY SUV,4,"I leased this vehicle to replace a M37x. I shopped for a new Q70 , but this vehicle had a better overall value. It is too much car for me personally, because I don't have a large at home family anymore.  But with the suttle upgrades in the exterior design for 2016, the smoothness of the ride, and the ample roominess and interior quality (and nice simple controls) of the vehicle, I was convinced to go with the QX60.  The Infiniti incentives to waive some remaining lease payments and other dealer incentives helped to get me in the door.  After seeing the QX60 fully loaded on the floor with the 20 inch wheels in diamond pearl white and java interior, I took that vehicle that day.  In retrospect, I did what I never do, completed an impulse buy without full research."
infiniti,qx60,2016,Alex K, 06/06/2016,Lexus RX with 3rd row (now with sport package),4,"Luxury, quiet interior (much better then plain Acura MDX), roomy driver/passenger seats (unlike cocoon in Audi Q7), roomy 3rd row (unlike Q7 or Volvo XC90), made in USA (unlike Q7 (Slovakia) or Volvo XC90), softer ride then in harsh XC90/Q7
"
infiniti,qx60,2016,Tyrone Pearson, 10/28/2016,Great family SUV,4,"The 3rd row seat has more room but hardly any cargo space left this is the only drawback. Great safety features at a great price for this luxury SUV with all the features they took off $7,000 off MSRP end of year 2016 but brand new, and Eric our sale rep was perfect the best knows how to treat customers the whole team over there at Claredon Hills Infinity went way over board.
"
infiniti,qx60,2016,Steve from the philly burbs, 09/20/2016,I rented this for a week and went 2000 miles,3,"I had to take a trip for work, in a rental.  I was looking for something that was comfortable for the driver, since my feet have issues in alot of cars with not enough legroom and awkward resting spots for my non-driving foot.  The interior was sharp, albeit missing basics for an expensive ""luxury"" car, like blind spot mirrors if not a blind spot warning system.  Same with bluetooth, no music streaming although you can connect your phone.  No nav system, for such a ""luxury"" brand, should be a crime.  The backup camera monitor was cheesy at best, and made the cheap Toyota RAV4 backup camera monitor look like HDTV.  Did it have nice finishes?  Yes.  Did it look amazing?  Yes.  I got 25 mpg on average, driving 70-75 mph, for 1000 miles non-stop in one day.  And I did it in one day on the way home too.  After spending 18 hours in the car, non-stop, you notice stuff.  You notice that you are in a luxury car, that is missing basics.  The headlights were amazing. The LED daytime lights and fog lights were very sharp.  But, it didn't have backup sensors to alert when too close, or even cross traffic detection.  For a luxury SUV of this size, I'd say that isn't fair.  All of that said, handling was most disappointing.  It had alot of road drifting, when at the highway speeds over 60 mph....it felt like the steering was jerky, and had to keep on it to keep it under control.  It was a newer car with only 5K on the odometer when I left.  I came back with over 7K on the odometer, done in two days - two very long non stop days.  I noticed a fair amount of vibration - my GPS on the dash mount was shaky and rattling alot.  That was annoying.  But I was comfortable.  And two guys had all their luggage easily fitting into the rear cargo area with loads of room to spare.   But I didn't long to drive, my partner at work drove most of the way.  He too noticed the challenging drive of this car.  It is BIG, and it takes little effort to steer, but wish it was a bit firmer steering.  A nice car in many ways, but I felt I could not enjoy the ride as I felt I was always correcting the car to keep it in my lane, thereby minimizing the experience (which I thought would be luxurious vs. tedious) on such a long ride back and forth.

infiniti,qx60,2016,Robert Shaw, 06/14/2016,2016 QX60 Beware of Problems,2,"Everyone knows about the undersized engine, etc. So I'm going to share my views on other issues. 

Rear seats are not comfortable as the there is no thigh support. Front seats lumbar does not extend far out enough.

Car emits high pitched whistling noise when air is on recirculation. Take a look at this Video on YouTube:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0sUMvyP6YI

Two car dealers says its normal. So if you like your car to whistle then this is the car for you!

Personally, I've leased 3 Infinitis in the past 10 years. Been driving 30 years, and never had this problem in any other car, so I don't think its normal. I regret my trust in Infiniti on this model.

infiniti,qx60,2016,The Coach, 12/05/2016,Fantastic and Spacious SUV,5,"After owning it for about 3 months, we're loving the QX60!  It has plenty of space for a family or cargo.

infiniti,qx60,2016,Neil Thomas, 05/10/2016,2016 QX60 Few months of Ownership,5,"I purchased this in March and so far the car has been just what I need. This is my first infiniti and I am extremely happy with it. I got a very good deal and I got the AWD with premium and + package which is so awesome and not too fancy. I got the Hermosa Blue with graphite interiors. Its perfect!! With the premium + package you get a lot of features such as illuminated strips of Infiniti on the doors, ambient lights, door lights. They have a nice design for the 2016. It looks really sporty and interiors are very comfortable. I was thinking of using regular fuel as company recommends Premium fuel, again its upto you. I have been putting 93 and 89 octane to get a average of 91 octane as this is recommended by Infiniti if you read the owners manual. I am very happy with this car and looking forward to post a review in 6 months. I got 3 years free oil service and tire rotations from Harte Infiniti Hartford. Tires I have now is AS Toyo Open Country A25 235/65/R18. I am planning to upgrade this to 235/55/R20 with Pirellis Scorpion Verde AS. 
Keep smiling and live life!!

"
infiniti,qx60,2016,Stu P, 05/15/2016,"Fancy, sleek, but not worth the dollars",3,"I drove one around for a week as a replacement for repairs.  I put about 1000 miles on it, it was new.  Some things really stood out.  First, it is a beautiful SUV, seats are comfortable with leather and plenty of space. Vision is nice with few blind spots.  It accelerates nicely and the V6 is really responsive, if a little noise.  Cruises at 75 nicely and very smooth.

But, for  A $50,000 car (I had a base model), it was really not much car for the money.  Bluetooth paired with phone for calls, but not for music....kind of amazing in todays world.  It did have an Aux jack in the storage, but that was not real useful.  Amazingly, it had RCA jacks too, not sure if Infinity thought I was going to hook up a cassette deck or something.

Back up camera was nice, especially with a 7 inch screen, but the infotainment system was useless so it was a waste of a screen,  climate controls were confusing and not easy to use.

Really much prefer my Outback, though not quite as comfortable, it does have many more features for much less money.  If it isabout looking good in a car, this is it, otherwise, I will pass.

"
infiniti,qx60,2016,Rabbit86, 06/05/2020,Great so far,4,"It was time for us to replace our family vehicle with something a little smaller now that our nest is nearly empty.  But we still needed to be able to tow.  Since we were also going to downsize by one vehicle and this would be my primary driver, I wanted something that was reasonably economical and more car like than our Suburban.  We drove several midsize SUV’s (or Crossovers) including the Acadia, Enclave, Highlander, Pathfinder, and a few different QX60’s.  We really wanted a center row bench, so that did limit our selections, although we were open to captain’s chairs if we felt the overall vehicle was better.  I didn’t like the first QX we drove, it was a 2015, AWD, with no options added.  We also drove a few fully loaded Enclaves (2015, 2017) and Acadia (SLT and Denali versions, 2016, 2017).  Then we drove the QX60 FWD with the 20-inch wheels that was fully loaded.  It was game over after that.  The QX was quieter, smoother and if nothing else felt more powerful than the other cars, even the Highlander which is basically the same vehicle with different styling.  So, we went for the QX60.  The one we purchased was the FWD, with Premium, Premium Plus, Technology and Theater packages, so a fully loaded car.
It’s gorgeous, with styling that is not too much “in your face” but definitely not “grocery getter”.  Ours is the Hakane (steel) Blue with a graphite interior.  The maple veneers complement the color wonderfully, and normally I don’t like wood grain trim.  Engine noise is virtually nonexistent.  Yes, the CVT feels a little strange, and there is a rubber band effect when you first take off that reminds me very much of a Prius.  Passing power is great, merging into Florida’s busy roads is never a problem.  Brakes are fantastic, smooth and even.  Handling is great, its not a Miata but doesn’t feel like a tall 7 passenger wagon either.  The view out, while driving, or backing up, is great, and the cameras help a lot.  It’s first time I felt so confident backing up a car I had never driven, and that has persisted.  Seats are comfortable, and link to the key fobs so my wife and I can have our own settings.  I do wish the Bluetooth setting would link to our key fob so it would pick right phone to sync with as changing it through the menus requires quite a few clicks, and you need to remember to do it before the radio comes on, which if you leave it on when you save your settings to the key – well, you will wait for the failure to connect. Speaking of the sound system, it’s played audio from our phones and from USB sticks without issue, and the 15-speaker system with subwoofer is one of the best sounding OE systems I have ever heard.  Having looked at a few new ones during our journey, not much has changed since 2016, the cup holder built into the console is different, but otherwise nothing seemed significantly different, we didn’t feel a bump in power between the 2016 and 2017 that we drove although there is supposed to be a 30+ hp difference.  Cargo capacity with the 3rd row up is small, but plentiful with the 3rd row collapsed, and the power fold up is handy for my wife who is much shorter than I am.  The roof rack is easy to use but will block that headroom robbing 2nd moonroof if you have the cover open when you are carrying items on the roof.  Also, good to remember that even with AWD, this is not an off-road vehicle, and watch those parking bump-stops (the front camera and collision warnings are great for that!)  We are averaging 22 MPG in mainly stop and go driving, almost always with the AC on, and reliability (the factory powertrain warranty is still in effect) has been perfect so far.  Oil changes are on par (we are using synthetic) with our Suburban.  And if I didn’t mention it – this thing is quiet on the road, sometimes it’s a little eerie!

infiniti,qx60,2016,Montreal , 08/25/2020,Very disappointing,2,"I owned qx60 for 4 years, replaced both door handle( and driver side twice) as the light were not work anymore, and one time because the handle was rusted. It’s wired. Besides that issue, I had two times noisy problem but the good thing is they all solved for free, because under warranty. The brake pads and disc were broken when the beginning of the 3 rd year and only 30k+ km, I don’t know why. Now I probably facing a new problem with my transmission, what ever I will definitely to buy other brand car on next time. It’s not a luxury car at all!

infiniti,qx60,2016,Steve, 07/21/2016,Everyday I wait to see what will be wrong next,1,"Now Infiniti had to buy the vehicle back under Lemon Law.  I would avoid Infiniti and Nissan products and if you are in Pittsburgh PA I would completely avoid the scam artists at Cochran.  I bought an Audi after selling back the Infiniti and could not be happier with a vehicle.


I have only had this vehicle for 6 months and have had more than enough problems.  There is a rattle in the front dash drivers side, but I am guessing loose or missing clips, which the dealershiponly took 2 months to correct.    City driving on standard mode is about 3 - 4 mpg less than sticker.  I do drive conservative so do not expect to get much better than that.  The seats are loose fitting for the body to sit in and dont hold you like other vehicles I have had.  They do not feel like they were built for anyone over 5' 10"".     The one item I did forget to mention is the camera system,  I think they could have used better, higher resolution cameras.  Any problems I am really finding the dealership is writing it off to  ""well thats the way its designed""  This is a manufacturer I will not honor with another purchase and Nissan the mother company has the same problems as Infiniti.

infiniti,qx60,2016,Doug, 08/25/2016,Disappointed,2,"I have had one of these as a rental car for over a week and can safely say I dislike it more than the day I got it.  As a vehicle it has nice seats and decent room but I expected much more from it. The ride for a normal SUV is decent but not for this level of SUV. The trim looks nice but there is cheapness in nasty places. For example the plastic on the steering wheel is thin and sticks out almost cutting your hand. It has poor acceleration by my standards.

infiniti,qx60,2016,Michael, 10/02/2017,"Great ride but poor economy, outdated technology",4,"2016 QX60 HYBRID drives great, holds 7 people fairly comfortably, is a comfortable and safe vehicle BUT IT SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE STANDARD FEATURES OF A HYBRID.  (I also own a Nissan Altima Hybrid.)  Standard features should include:  engine ""off"" in stopped conditions (even with AC on), ability to use ""fan only"" for fresh air without the AC activating, electronic driving in ""non load"" (flat, no hills, etc.) conditions.  Additionally, a hybrid vehicle should get better mileage than it's all gas equivalent.  This vehicle fails on all ""hybrid"" traits.  The TECHNOLOGY is outdated.  Blue tooth connects to your phone but to actually dial it is anywhere from 4-8 steps.  (Infinity forgot the KISS principle...Keep It Simple Stupid.)  Additionally, there is no way to connect to your Android phone to display maps, IM, email, calendar, etc. in a open communication method.  Infinity does allow limited connectivity using ""Infinity Connect"" for a fee but it doesn't work well.  Infinity is a car company, not a technology company...let Google do that by allowing Android Auto to connect to the vehicle technology infrastructure.  Another ""whoops"" by Infinity is only offering 1 USB port in the vehicle.  Say ""What""?      SUMMARY: If you're thinking of buying a 7-seat hybrid SUV, Infinity QX60 Hybrid is a great driving vehicle but doesn't perform like a hybrid, doesn't have current technology and doesn't offer an open interface to 3rd party applications.

infiniti,qx60,2017,Lewis’ Review, 03/05/2018,Great SUV - Very Comfortable and Quiet,5,"Really like the Infiniti QX60 after 8 months of driving.  It’s a great SUV that is very comfortable, plush and quiet to drive.  Test drove Lexus, BMW, Audi, Acura,  Subaru, VW, Toyota and Honda SUVs before buying Infiniti QX60.  Here are some of my likes, neutral and dislikes of the QX60:

Likes:

- Navigation: Easy to use, extremely clear directions and touch screen works very well
- Seats: Very comfortable and plush seats with soft leather - good on long trips
- Quiet:  Keeps out road noise and quiet when using phone
- Style: Very sporty and stylist SUV which looks great
- Controls: Both push buttons and on-screen controls are easy to use and are well placed.  Steering wheel controls are really easy to navigate while driving for both radio and cruise control.
- Safety Features: Blind spot warning, adaptive cruise control, auto stop in reverse when object appears and parking sensors work well and really nice to have
- Camera: Backup, front and 360 view cameras are great to have and clear
- Eco Mode: 2 miles per gallon extra 
- Auto Dim Mirrors: Like the auto dim side mirrors which really helps with the light glare at night


Neutral:

- Stereo: great sound which is comparable to other brands
- Engine: Lots of power in standard and sports mode.  Eco mode a bit slow to take off to save gas and resists you flowing it, but will allow with a short delay.  Eco mode takes time to get used to, I drive 95% of time in Eco and it now feels normal.
- Sunroof: Standard sunroof
- Gas mileage: Standard gas mileage for larger SUV (20MPG in city and 25MPG on highway) 

Dislikes:

- Roof Bars: Would be nice to have real roof bars that you could tie rope to.  Roof bars are cosmetic unless you buy cross bars.
- Navigation Settings: Safety feature that turns off address input while car is in motion.  Won’t let passenger even add it.  A lot of new cars are restricting this option too. However, it does allow previous address location to be added while driving which is a plus."
infiniti,qx60,2017,Peter G., 12/12/2016,"Versatilely, Reliability, Comfort & Value",5,"Exciting, it is not. BUT the QX60 does everything smoothly and very well. Perhaps I am alone, but I really like the CVT in this vehicle. I waited for the 2017 model, which upgraded the HP +30, the Torque +20 and slightly improved the handling.. Adult passengers love the rear seat. This entire class of SUVs is so extremely competitive, it is hard to go wrong with any of them. I took it easy on the options and ended up with a sticker price of $53,000. Shop different Infiniti dealers for lease pricing.

infiniti,qx60,2017,JR, 01/20/2017,Still in love with my QX60,5,"Bought this car a month ago, replacing my 2013 Infiniti JX35.  Better power, smoother ride, quieter ride, dark carpets instead of beige a real advantage, a great ride.  Is it good for off road, I'll never know, or will I care!  Is it a great looking, great driving ride, absolutely!  A big improvement over 2013 model Infiniti!  Looked at Acura, Cadillac, Mazda, Lexus, and I was drawn back to Infiniti, so glad I was!

After 18 months, my opinion hasn’t changed one bit.  Dependable, comfortable, just finished a 1200 mile road trip, 25.7 mpg.  Still get compliments on the looks, how can it be any better?
3 1/2 years later and I still love my QX60.  Great Ride, quiet, just returned from a road trip, over 2000 miles, got over 27 mpg, at 70+ mph!  No issues with it mechanically!  What’s not to like?  Have 49,000 trouble free miles!

infiniti,qx60,2017,HappyQX60Driver, 03/17/2018,Great SUV!,5,"I did a lot of research before purchasing.  I mean A LOT! Once I narrowed my choices down to 3, I had a spreadsheet to list the prominent features, including gas mileage, weight, height, leg room (my family is tall), features, etc.  The QX60 lined up pretty good with the Acura, but I thought the QX60 had a little more pizazz.  So then on to the test drive - the QX60 blew me away with that variable transmission - once into Sport mode, oh yes, it's in the wind!  It's comfortable, a great ride (nice and quiet) and we've taken it on the road in a thunderstorm - handled great.  I've used the 3rd row, though only for kids.  The kids were very happy back there as they had ""privacy"" (ha!) and USB ports.  I especially like the Bluetooth and the sound of the stereo.  I still have mine at the factory settings cause there is no need to fiddle with it, sounds really good right where it is.  I get lots of compliments especially from people who drive Vans - the QX60 is just as tall but without those weird doors you get on a Van.  There is plenty room for everyone and whenever someone is in the 2nd row, they remark about how roomy it is.  It's the car I wanted, and I got it - mine is Majestic White with the Wheat interior - its really a good looking SUV.  Very happy with my purchase and proud that I did the research to make sure I got the best for my money.  Good job Infiniti!"
infiniti,qx60,2017,Doug, 10/08/2017,A lot of bang for the buck,5,"Never thought of buying an Infinity before but glad I did. We do a lot of driving by living on the east coast and wife's family on the west coast. So the need was there for comfort and drive ability on the long trips. The QX60 was a very wise choice, not only for cargo capacity but for outward visibility, quiet interior, very comfortable seats and the safety of all wheel drive. In my view I don't think there is a better seven passenger SUV on the market today for the price of the Infinity QX60. Not only do you have a luxury brand vehicle in your driveway but the feel good factor is priceless. Would I buy another, you bet I would and the treatment you receive at the dealership is second to none.

The bluetooth cuts in and out.  The phone feature fails to place calls for periods of time.  The sunroof leaks.  The middle row seat vibrates.  Driving down roads as smooth as silk the middle row seat will vibrate.  Our boys refuse to sit in the seat.  It is unusable.  So much for a 3rd row vehicle. The dealer says all the QX60s have that ""feature"".  When backing up the display has gone completely dark.  No camera, no audio controls.  Only way to fix is to restart the car.  We purchased this car with the expectation that it would last for many years.  I don't see this car making it through spring.  We have spent a lot of money for a well below average car and are considering trading it in and cutting our losses.  Infiniti case #25643554.

This is not always possible when you are driving.  All I have heard from the dealer is ""Corporate is aware of the problems."" I have video of these problems.  It will stall right after starting. I have also contacted the NTSB over the headlights in this vehicle. They have such a poor range it is dangerous.

No matter how slowly I turn on a wet road, the back of the QX60 loses traction and fishtails.  This makes driving in the rain very unnerving.  I hope that fix this issue in future models.  Otherwise, it is a great SUV!

I recently had my Infiniti serviced and was not told that my registration sticker had expired.  Although this is not your responsibility, it would have been nice for a service person to have noticed and told me this since they were doing an overall service.  A week later, I received a citation for the expired registration.  When I went to have the inspection done, they showed me that the power steering fluid reservoir was completely empty!  THIS WAS PART OF THE SERVICE!! The service department continues to disappoint me.

So many issues in a short period of time it has become the worst vehicle I have owned unfortunately and to the point where I will drop the car off back at the dealership and purchase something else. I don't have the time to deal with a vehicle of 53k value as if it were pieced together from spare parts from a junkyard. I always read reviews before buying vehicles and I have stuck with Nissan & Infiniti for the past ten years for their workhorse engines as two of my Nissans went to 289k & 377k miles but after this SUV I am jumping ship as soon as possible.

Took it in for routine service (15k service at 14k miles), and have been back to the dealership 3 times in two weeks. First, I noticed ""oil"" on my garage floor after the service. Had them check it out only to discover it was a transmission issue. They replaced the transmission with a 2019 transmission. Less than a week later (today) the car gave a strong shudder while stopped at a stop sign. I had to put it in park to get it to stop. My son in the back seat felt it. Took it right back to the dealership and am waiting to hear what the issue is. Really regretting buying this car. Its way too young to have issues with major parts. I've had four different cars in my lifetime and never issues like this so early on.

infiniti,qx60,2017,Sad Infiniti owner, 08/19/2017,Have to say worse purchase ever,1,"We have had a large number of cars over the years of varied makes and models and I have to say this has been the worse one ever.  The vehicle drives so poorly that none of the 5 drivers in our home want to ""get stuck with the Infiniti"".  It has poor acceleration from and stop, and worse when entering a highway or passing.  To maintain speed the driver must constantly be pressing on the gas pedal as the car gains little to no momentum.   It has the same exact instruments as a Nissan Altima, at about 3x the cost.   The brake pedal will travel almost to the floor at times.    Sport mode makes little to no difference, the car drives and acts like the old go karts we all used at amusement parks.   We tried to bring this sad vehicle back and were offered almost 12000 less then we paid as we were told they have a poor resale value.   I guess we all make mistakes but if you can avoid this one you will be happier."

And worst Customer service!,1,"It is terrible when Infiniti customer relations (not Infiniti service facility) just doesn't care.  I was told that my car had issues that are not common for most Infiniti's but as mine was made in Tennessee, it had some rare issues.  These issues started since the first few month on purchase with a moldy smell from a/c as stated by service that just wasn't built right and they are looking to correct it. Had an accident where my auto brake didn't kick in cause of another malfunction. When called customer relations, they said I would have had to call them before repairs made and I didn't know it was the car until it happened a second time. When asked the service how often I should get checked, they said never- this almost never happens.  Customer Relations still refuses to just get me a repurchase - which is basically giving me the car I paid for without the safety issues and concerns. It is sad when even my friends all know that my car is continually in the repair. It is also sad when the service department manager gives you the customer relations phone number with what to say because they feel I am there just a little too much. I just want what I paid so much for.
"
infiniti,qx60,2017,NBinCO, 01/24/2019,"Gets the job done, but is that all you want?",3,"I'm a car guy through and through, so here's my take. There are many good things about the QX60, and at the end of the day it reliably serves it purpose with comfort, good looks, and safety. However, the QX60 seems to be better served as just a leased vehicle for someone who wants a mid-luxury 7 passenger SUV for the practicality and look. Rivals in the segment are years ahead in performance and technology, and hold value better to boot. In short, a new Explorer or MDX is likely in our future as they represent better choices in my opinion.  On the ""good"" side, it's a classy SUV with tons of space and great comfort. Headlights are awesome, and it has most of the features that people want in this segment (heated seats, nav, 360 camera, remote start, moonroof, Bose sound.) The motor is from the long-standing VQ series V6 which has been around in some variant since 1995 - so it probably will give you 200K miles without much fuss. On the ""bad"" side, the performance is mediocre. 295 HP isn't that much in a 3-row SUV, and the acceleration is poor. Holding back the motor is the soul-sucking CVT transmission. It doesn't deliver better mileage, and robs power to the wheels. To boot, it's highly jerky on a cold morning and doesn't settle down for 5-10 minutes of driving. OEM tires are garbage, they provide nothing beyond comfort. They are basically shot by 30,000 miles even with gentle driving and regular rotations. Technology is a weak point. Yes, it has the latest driver assist stuff; but the infotainment is frustrating and poorly designed. The 2014 Jeep we traded in to get the QX was light years ahead on infotainment. If you pull the dipstick out, it is almost impossible to get back in.  In summary, it's just not the best choice in the segment. The QX60 caters to the opposite of an enthusiast, nor does it achieve more than middle-of-the pack status in any area. Ours has been trouble free, but I won't miss it one bit.

Mine is loaded with all options save for Theater Package.  I am very pleased with it overall.  There are a few nagging features or rather lack thereof.  1) The radio turns off with the ignition, unlike my two older vehicles of different makes where the radio stays on until the driver's door is opened. 2) the main screen always resets to Navigation instead of last used.  And then when one goes to radio, it always goes to the first set of presets rather than last used.  Finally 3) there does not seem to be a ""walk away"" lock function that automatically locks the car for you.  Oddly Nissan/Infiniti Blogs have complaints about them going back a number of years.  It is strange that Nissan has not corrected them.  But they are just annoyances and overall the QX60 is a pleasure to own.

infiniti,qx60,2018,InfinitiInolongertrustyou, 11/07/2018,Infiniti Quality Seems to be Going Down,2,"This is my second Infiniti and did I say I love Infiniti? Yet, this QX60 has been a big letdown for many reasons. In the 12K miles of ownership I had the following warranty repairs: Engine Fan Replaced, Telematics Unit Failure Replaced, Computer for Vehicle Replaced, SD card holder for the map replaced, two eccentric bolts replaced when alignment couldn't be aligned, and there was a minor engine repair under warranty and the number one issue besides the warranty repairs (these weren't recalls) these things just broke on my vehicle...the headlights are terrible. Check out the new government rating on these they are given a grade of P for poor for visibility, I concur when it is raining you can't see the road as the lights dilute). I would concur I can't see at night, when it is raining and they can't be adjusted.  If you conduct a search and type in QX60 headlight ratings 2018 or 2019 you will see the vehicle earned a P. I would concur, the problem is Infiniti seems deaf on this issue as going back to 2016 there are numerous complaints of not being able to see (you see the side of the road more than you see the front of the road).  There is no adjustment whatsover, I went to two dealers. If I had known that I would have stayed away as when you can't see it is to dangerous and you can kill someone or someone else. When I tell you it looks like you are driving with your parking lights on in the rain when the lights are actually on I kid you not. The only workaround is costing me $600.00 and I am having a mechanic change the holder of the headlight, the lens to a clear one, and because we are chaning the holder inside it can be adjusted. When I spent that money all of a sudden I could see, but shame on you Infiniti this is a $40K plus vehicle I purchased the one with every option available. Shame on you, when I spoke to Infiniti Consumer Affairs they told me they couldn't assist me with any of the money from the headlights.  Do you know the 2019 vehicle gets a poor on headlights as well? Overall I don't think I will purchase another Infiniti, as in $12K miles of mostly highway driving I had numerous warranty repairs of parts failing. This isn't the Infiniti brand I expect and what I thought I purchased. I had a Q70 and ran it for 125K miles and never had one part failure, not one warranty repair, nothing.  It ran like a well oiled machine should and look at Consumer Reports (I didn't see it so it was to late for me, but not for you).  They rated the 2016&2017 QX60 in reliablity less than average, for 2018 it moved up to average. Whatever happened to the above average that Infiniti was known for? I didn't get a lemon, others in the forums online indicate similar issues to mine (some have had CVT failures) at early time. Until Infiniti can get their quality where it needs to be and headlights that actually shine correctly slo you can see the road I would purchase a Lexus, Buick, or other nameplate. Certified Lexus is tough to go wrong with, and this is from a person (me) that loves Infiniti. If I could get out of this vehicle now without taking a huge loss I would run for my life. I don't trust this vehicle, nor the Infiniti brand anymore.

infiniti,qx60,2018,Nivcogn, 06/14/2018,Daily Car for a Growing Family,3,"We needed a bigger car for our growing family.  The Q5 can only fit 2 baby car seats in the back.  We looked at Yukon XL and Expedition, but realized that it is not a great car for daily drive since it is too big.  Those cars are great for long road trip and can be rented at any time.  Audi Q7 is a nice car but just way too expensive.  Our choices came down to VW Atlas, Infiniti QX60, and Honda Pilot.  What is nice about the Atlas and QX60 is the ability to get to the back seats without having to remove the baby car seats.  The exterior styling is what sold the QX60 to my wife even through the Atlas has a nice panoramic sunroof similar to Audi's (QX60's is lacking...not as grand/nice).  The other reason to go with QX60 is Infiniti's lease; they give really affordable leases that I don't think anyone can match.  For zero down (only first payment of $479), we drove away in a 2018 Infiniti QX60 AWD Premium Plus that has remote start and heated steering wheel.  Our lease is for 39 months with 12k miles/year.  I don't think we could even lease a Q5 for that price.  The ride and handling is not as nice as our Audis; however, it is pretty good.  We are not fond of the CVT and don't really care since it is a lease.  Overall, it is a great choice for our family.  Great car with most of the things we wanted at a relatively affordable pricing.

infiniti,qx60,2018,MikeB, 01/29/2018,"Quiet and comfortable, but only 4 stars",4,"This vehicle feels substantial.  It's smooth and quiet around town and on the highway.  Front seats are comfortable and supportive.  The CVT transmission works very well -- none of the annoying hunting for the proper gear, or downshifting one or two gears when all you want to do is go just a little faster.  And it works like it has 7 discrete gears when in manual mode.  Fuel mileage is beyond our expectations at 21 mpg in the suburbs with some freeway, and 24-26 mpg on highway trips, even at 75-80 mph.  Things we don't like: Small and somewhat dim numbers and letters on the trip info display between the speedometer and tach.  Also, it's way too easy to spin the front tires on acceleration from a stop, almost like the traction control isn't working.  Finally, making a voice-activated phone call takes one or two steps more than with other systems, such as Ford's Sync 3.

infiniti,qx60,2018,Paula, 08/03/2018,White interior leather defective on driver's side,4,"For the most part I am happy with the vehicle.

There is one issue that stands out.    When I was in the showroom I noticed that the demo QX60's white leather seating on the driver's side was worn and discolored on the seat area (left side).   I remember pointing it out to the salesman.    How can something so NEW be worn.     Well, I have my QX60 4 months and I am having the same problem.   I pointed this out to Circle Infiniti in Long Branch when I had the car serviced yesterday.    They looked at it and wanted to give me an estimate for dying it.    Of course that is ridiculous and I refused!  I made them make note of it in the computer.    This is not my fault.   This is the result of an inferior leather used on the area of the vehicle that gets the most use.    I also, noticed that all the used cars on the lot had this same problem.

Would turn in now however, I know my husband will be irritated with me as I've begged him to get me this car.  Here's the thing, I've driven Cadillacs, Mercedes, Lincolns... This car is very comfortable for our family, especially for the price.  My issue is with the dealerships.  I miss the Lincoln dealership experience so much!   The other luxury companies offer complimentary maintenance why doesn't INFINITI?  Sorry Infiniti but this is why as soon as I can I will be leaving for the new Navigator or Escalade.  There's no way om earth that i would upgrade to the qx80 and not have the same luxury dealer experience that the other companies offer.  I literally felt like I was back at the pontiac dealership from my college days... not a good thing for a ""luxury"" company.  This may be the reason you had to offer huge discounts on your vehicles as there aren't many of them on the road. ;-)... I'm over INFINITI experience such a rip off plus the technology Infiniti vehicles are several years behind the times.

Sometimes I have to put the petal to the metal and I feel confident when doing IT!   Don't believe the low ratings.  I do believe other automakers hire people to ""hate"" on other cars because their product is crappy.... so they make up these horrible reviews and create great reviews for themselves.  I've driven all of the major luxury brands and INFINITI beats them all for me.  The QX60 is a good car.  Interior does need more updating...But overall great vehicle.

The second row seat head rests are in the way when children are sitting in the third row seats making it very difficult to see the entertainment screens that are placed on the back of the front seat headrests.

I have had none of the problems mentioned in other reviews. It does take mid-tier/premium gas while my husbands 2018RX takes regular gas , yet we take it on long trips as the ride is great.

Rattled for months and I finally had it checked out. Took dealer an entire day to fix it. Also, I’m very dissatisfied with the heating system. In the winter of Ohio, this vehicle doesn’t provide warmth. It doesn’t provide warm air comfort. No warm air at feet even though setting is on feet only. Good thing my seats and steering wheel heat up....this is the only thing that keeps me warm enough. Just not happy overall with this vehicle. I am looking to replace it. "
infiniti,qx60,2018,Tbc from toronto, 05/26/2020,I had a Lexus. Bought Infiniti. Regret it,1,"I had an rx3tp which provided me with 12 years without issue but when time to get a new car, Infiniti seemed to be a better value.  I’ve regretted it since.  First, all these loose trim pieces and lack of quality.  2 years old and already lots of rust.  I thought loose trim pieces would be covered by warranty but dealership refused to fix and told me I need to go back to dealership I bought it from which is far away.  I bought oil change and tire rotation.  With Lexus, they would include changing tires from winter to summer if you had a tire rotation being paid for,  Infiniti, they charge you fulll price to change tires even if you have paid for tire rotation.  They seem to nickel and dime you and won’t repair things under warranty.  This is not a luxury dealership.

The car is ok.  I actually don’t mind the cvt which I was worried about.  It seems responsive.  The ac is horrible.  Blows hot air in summer at anything below the lowest temperature setting.  The dealership says known issue and I’ve seen reviews saying this as well.

Lane centering in this model is brake!! Based and not steering wheel and is basically useless.  Out of date without android auto but I know that so doesn’t bother me too much.

I thought I was saving money but this will cost me more than a Lexus taking into account resale and warranty work I have  to pay out of pocket.

Do not buy this car.  It seems like a deal but you will regret it.

My vehicles are serviced by the dealership hweee I purchased. After only 42,000 KMs and 20 months of ownership I had to replace the rear rotors and pads and service the front brakes (incl resurface the rotors and lubing the caliber pins). Compared to my 2016 VW GTI that was serviced at 90,000 KM with original brakes and no issues at all- I should have bought an Atlas. I’ve owned a lot of new VW’s in the past and have always been impressed with longevity out of the factory. My Infiniti is a comfortable and otherwise good vehicle but front and rear brakes at under 2 years and at 40,000 kms is very disappointing

infiniti,qx60,2019,Xanekka, 11/30/2018,"If you don't own a smartphone, it's a good car",3,"It's a good and spacious car. I like it as a thing that carries me from point A to B comfortably. The problem is I own a smartphone. I want to listen to podcasts when I drive. And the audio keeps cutting off. (It has a non-navi system to those who are interested.) My dealership people were nice, so I went to them to investigate this Bluetooth problem. Here's what I learned. Infiniti does NOT support all the Bluetooth profiles and it does not support all the phones. Which is weird because Bluetooth is a standard and it's supposed to solve that problem. The solution that they recommended was to use a 3.5mm audio cable. Tough luck for me because the two phones that I own are Pixel 2 XL and iPhone 7 Plus. Neither have a headphone jack. So, the dealership recommended that I call the Infiniti Consumer Affairs. They troubleshoot me through a process which resulted in ""you are using unsupported phones"" for audio streaming? Okay, it's Nov 2018. One of my phones is a year old and the other two years. I like the car enough and I am already stuck in a lease, I might as well upgrade my phone, I thought. So, I asked the nice lady from the Infiniti Consumer Affairs, I am going to get a new phone. Please tell me which phone to get. I am open to switching carriers too. She was kind enough to go through the list for me. Let's start with Apple: iPhone XS (not supported), iPhone XS Max (not supported), iPhone XR (not supported), iPhone 8 (not supported), iPhone 8 Plus (not supported). Now, Google. None of the Pixel phones are supported. Next, Samsung. Note 9 (not supported), S9+  (not supported), S9 (not supported), S8+ (not supported), S8 (not supported). At that point, the poor lady from Infiniti Consumer Affairs gave up, rightly so and told me that I would get a call from the Infiniti Bluetooth division, which I haven't heard from yet! So, right now, I am driving around in a $46,000 ""luxury"" vehicle with technology from 2003. Again, it's a good car with a serious technology problem.
"
infiniti,qx60,2019,Dale, 10/30/2018,Comfort over sport,4,"Make sure you drive the vehicle at night, because the surround camera view does NOT employ the use of the lighted entry features offered with luxury options. In other words, the side looking cameras can't see anything at night and are completely blind unless there is a significant external light source where you're parking. Vehicle entry is also ""old school"" even though the car illuminates nicely when you approach, you're still required to press a button to unlock doors, which is not the case in the lower model QX50 which automatically unlocks when you grab the handle. Also, the radio doesn't stay on when engine is turned off, unlike the lesser model QX50, it violently shuts everything off, and there is no way for you to go directly from running to Accessory mode. Infiniti advertises the Sensory package supports Dolby Digital 5.1 (""decoding""), but the stereo manufacturer (Bose) confirmed that this is false and an oversight by marketing, for that feature was removed back in 2017 in favor of a more ""entire cabin friendly"" surround solution. There are features that allow you to select a ""driver centric"" auditory configuration, but this falls way short of true surround as one might experience from the Bose Panaray system in other vehicles. Finally, make sure the dealer demonstrates everything in your potential purchase as there are audio and video AUX features that may, or may not work as advertised.

infiniti,qx60,2019,Jim from CA, 05/24/2019,My Infiniti QX60 is outstanding!,5,"There is a reason that Consumer Reports just rated the Infiniti QX 60 in the top three of luxury three row SUVs!   We have now had our 2019 white Infiniti QX60 for two years and have driven it through deep snow in the Sierras for two weeks as well as been on dirt roads in the desert.  AWD is fabulous...I tried but could not break the wheels loose in snow.  The AWD is intuitive and the best we have ever uses for an SUV. 

I also researched Audi Q7, MB, Porsche SUVs too, and the QX 60 plush seats, great NAV, ease of controls, and driver assist is every bit as good as any manufacturer...but at $10k less!   

We have had it loaded with skis, luggage, beer, food, and our dog and it still got 26 MPG on a freeway trip.  This SUV ride is just as luxurious as my neighbors $90K Range Rover, on and off road.    Not only that, I can get my ten foot surfboard inside the car with the nose on the dash.  Hilarious, right?  

The audio system is the best we’ve ever owned, transmission is outstanding and this QX60 has no problem passing cars at 90 mph.   It feels like going 50!   On top of all of the great features...Infiniti offers 4 yr 60K miles...the best of any company, too.  Lastly our last car was a 2016 Acura MDX and this Infiniti QX60 is better in multiple ways even though the Acura was great.

Lastly, I think Edmunds is a great resource, but with caveats.   Consumer Reports is the same.  They rate cars by multiple factors...but don’t always address depreciation...which is a big factor.   Here is an example:  Audi Q7, Porsche Cayenne, MB SUV all depreciate between $10K and $15 k in the first year alone.   In 2018 my friend bought a 2017 Audi Q7 with 20K miles on it for $53K.   That car sold new for $68k.   That is a big hit on the original owner if one does the math.  And Range Rover? Are you kidding?  That $85K SUV can lose $35 k in two years in depreciation.

infiniti,qx60,2019,Henry, 01/02/2019,Perfect Family Vehicle,5,"I think this is one of the best 3 rows SUV available today in terms of price/value, performance,  comfort, style, safety, and technology. Maybe It doesn’t score any A+ in every Category but pretty much get an solid A- or B+ on each so it’s a very well around vehicle. Never a fan of any of the CVTs but at least I don’t hate it on the QX60. Yes, the suspension is a bit too soft but no one would take a 3 rows suv for any spirit driving. And the value here is just unbeatable. Q7 and xc90 are better cars but cost $15-20k more similarly equipped.

Nothing but problems and I haven't even had it 6 months. I thought I was going up in quality by moving up from the Nissan Muranos I had for so many years and loved. Nope! Leasing the QX60 was the worst decision I've ever made. I never had as many problems with the Muranos as I do this QX60. How can they charge so much more for something so much worse? Now I have to somehow find time and money to drive the 5 hours to my nearest Infiniti dealer so he can look at the condensation in my headlight and ""see"" if it will be covered by warranty. I have had 4 Murano's in the past 10 years. None ever had that problem. This QX60 features don't even come close to the features of my last 2 Murano's.

infiniti,qx60,2020,Joe P, 11/22/2019,Great Value for the Money,4,"Just bought a 2020  Infiniti QX60 Luxe. It comes standard with an upgraded 13-speaker audio system, driver-seat memory settings, and a remote engine start system for not much more than the base model. We added in the Essential package for its upgraded seating material, navigation and surround-view camera system, and then opted for the ProAssist package to gain an excellent adaptive cruise control system, lane keeping assist, and front and rear parking sensors.
Innovative rear seating gives legitimate room to access 3rd row.
This car is quiet, good looking inside and out, so so comfortable, a great drive and a great value.  Appreciate the 6 cylinder for quietness and ample power.  Drove all compeditors: Mecedes GLE (Priced over 10k more beautiful inside but 4 cylinder engine is like a sewing machine, 6 cylinder is another +10 more), Kia Telluride (too large and not as comfortable), BMW 5 series which is way more expensive and tighter cabin, Lexus RX (can't stand the nose on that car and much smaller inside and more expensive), Acura MDX ( Very nice and a competitor but it came down to price for a similarly optioned car, Infinity is better looking IMO).
Infinity doing great deals as 2022 model is the next to come out in a year or so (will probably go the turbo 4 route like the QX50 though). Good warranty and bought 3 years service for about 1/2 price up front.

Of all the car we drove, and given we purchased this suv in Dec,2019, we felt we got the best deal for a semi-luxury SUV for price that is in the range of other mid-range SUVs.  This SUV has a decent interior design and quality even though its GPS is outdated and some trims materials are shared with Nissan parts.  But given at this price point of around $40k, you are saving thousands comparing to Q7, RX350L, GLE350 and even Kia Tulleride (high dealer markup), this is the best combination of getting a semi- luxury brand vesicle, 4yr/60k full warranty, and other amenities.

The second row is just as plush and comfortable and the front but there should of been the ability to slide the second row forward to allow for adults in the third row.

infiniti,qx80,2014,Stuart, 03/27/2019,Fantastic Luxery SUV,5,"We had seen the QX80 on the road, but never even looked into them when looking for our Luxury SUV with 3rd row.  We drove the Escalade, Mercedes G wagon, Toyota Land cruiser.  We couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised with the QX80.  It's really plush interior, strong acceleration and a feeling both me and the wife described as though it was carved out of one piece of metal.  Everything is just so solid.  We love the 4wd, laser cruise control, emergency braking along with so many other options, we're just really pleased with this vehicle.  We have the hydraulic handling package, not sure how or what it does, but for a large vehicle, handling is a breeze.  The 360 view camera is a must but parking lots or open roads are equally very easy to drive in.  The only thing we would do different is the 22 inch wheels, they do look nice, but they are very large!"

I have had the opportunity to drive numerous vehicles through the years.  This is by far my favorite SUV.  Once I experienced the QX, it is hard to drive something different.  This vehicle has all the bells and whistles inside and out.  It is a spacious SUV with plenty of horsepower.  The quality is seen throughout the entire vehicle.  I cannot say enough about the QX80.  I would definitely recommend it for those looking for quality, beauty, spaciousness, and overall performance.

infiniti,qx80,2015,Craig Elford, 06/11/2016,Great Infiniti QX80 Ownership Experience,5,"My 2015 QX80 is my second Infiniti full size SUV as I previously drove a 2006 QX56 which I still own as a third vehicle for our family.  I put over 205,000 miles on the 2006 model, and had absolutely no problems.  Great quality vehicle with outstanding ownership experience.  When it came time to look at new vehicles I again did rigorous evaluation before purchasing my 2015 QX80.  I looked at the Ford Expedition (I previously owned a 1997 model), the Lincoln Navigator (my wife drives a 2006 model), the Cadillac Escalade, the GMC Yukon Denali, the Chevy Tahoe LTZ, and the Toyota Sequoia Platinum.  

I am 6'-8"" and immediately eliminated the Toyota Sequoia as I could not even sit in the driver seat due to the very short headroom as my head hit the ceiling even with the seat back reclined pretty significantly.  I loved the legroom and headroom for all the GM products as they had best in class legroom, but GM still has not engineered a decent 3rd row seat to fold flat into the floor.  While they advertise the new versions that way, in reality you lose at least 4"" in the height of the cargo area as they have artificially raised the cargo floor to accommodate the third row seating when folded down.  Legroom on their 3rd row seating was basically unusable.  That left the Lincoln Navigator and the Ford Expedition, but there was simply no comparison when evaluating the quality of the vehicles between the Infiniti QX80 and the Ford and Lincoln products.  

I have been extremely pleased with the outstanding quality of my QX-80.  With 400 horsepower it has plenty of power to provide effective performance for such a large, heavy vehicle.  While it does not have sports car acceleration, if you are driving a full size SUV that is not a primary consideration.  I have found the 5.6 liter engine to have plenty of power and zip and even when cruising at 70 mph there is still plenty of acceleration when you need to pass.  The 315 horses available on my 2006 QX56 was adequate, and the new fuel injection on the QX80 provides a noticeable difference in power.  

The greatest improvements in with the QX-80 is in the changes made with technology to improve the ride and to make the driving experience safer.  I have found the blind spot monitor to be a tremendous help, and the intelligent cruise control is an amazing technology to monitor what is happening with vehicles ahead of you to ensure safe distances are maintained.  If you have not used this technology, you will love it as you can set the interval you are looking to maintain and the sensors on the vehicle do an amazing job of monitoring not only the vehicle immediately in front of you, but also the vehicle on ahead to determine if there is a potential safety hazard and will automatically adjust the set speed accordingly.

The driving and passenger ride experience is incredibly comfortable.  With the long wheel base, the quality of the seats, and the suspension system provides a luxury car ride for your passengers.  I get so many compliments from those riding with me as to how incredibly comfortable the ride is as well as how impressed they are with the luxury finish.  Infiniti has used very high quality materials and it is very evident in the look and feel of the vehicle.  

Even with the size of a full size SUV, the QX80 handles incredibly well for both highway driving, city driving, and the surround view cameras and sensors make it every easy to handle vehicle even in tight spaces.  Turning radius is excellent for this size vehicle and I can actually U-turn in a much smaller radius than many passenger cars.  This vehicle is a dream to drive on the highway as the ride is so comfortable, yet when needed the handling is very responsive.  

Another great advantage to a full size SUV is the amount of cargo you can haul in the cargo area behind the 2nd row, and if necessary with the second row captain
 seats folded down.  I have hauled an incredible amount of gear in my vehicle multiple times over the past 27 months and having the voluminous cargo area is great.  This is where it is so important at the elegant engineering of how the 3rd row seating folds into the floor.

While I would agree with the other two reviews listed regarding the low end of the gas gauge accuracy, and at times the shifting of the transmission could be smoother, but that is only when you are really pushing the vehicle and need to accelerate quickly.  Overall, to me these are very small issues compared to the overall quality and experience of owning this vehicle.  The QX80 also has unique styling which you may either love or hate, but you won't look like every other full size SUV on the road.  I personally really like the styling as it is not just a square box like so many of the competitors.

The net is, I love my 2015 Infiniti QX80, and would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone.  We have been so impressed with my QX80 we purchased a new 2017 QX60 for my wife to replace her old vehicle. She loves it!

infiniti,qx80,2015,Tim, 11/28/2016,Climate Control Issues very uncomfortable,3,"When the Outside Temperature is between 40 & 60 degrees & the Vehicle Climate Control is Auto the center & floor Vents run 15 to 20 degrees warmer than the other vents making it uncomfortable. In order to keep your feet from sweating the outside vents have to be closed & the interior temperature is controlled by the center & floor vents (this is the only way to lower the temperature without having cold air come out of the Side Vents). Having the side vents closed makes your arm closest to the door cold when the outside temperature is in the 40s, unless you are wearing a jacket.  I brought the vehicle back to the dealer I purchased it from they kept it for 4 days & told me that was normal.  I placed a temperature gauges in the vents & photographed the Outside Airtemp reading and interior controls documenting the issue, I took the vehicle to another Infinity Dealer with the Presentation that illustrated the temperature difference between vents.  The Service Adviser was great he contact the Infinity Rep & validated my concern.  After another 24 hours without my vehicle the Answer from Infinity = all the QX80s have the same issue it is normal.  It maybe normal for the QX80 however my Lexus or Toyota do not have a 20 degree split between vents, nor do I remember any other vehicle I have owned.  This is a great vehicle, however if you live a 4 season climate twice a year you need to compensate for the Climate Control Anomaly. I would think the fix would be straight forward, either a sensor or software issue.  The Climate Control issue will make me look at a different vehicle when the time comes for another SUV. The Gas issue described in another review is accurate - The Amber lite illuminates after using around 19 gallons, that doesn't bother me now that I know @ at 15mpg there is only 105 miles left in the tank if you drive easy.  I generally fill all my vehicles at 1/4 tank

infiniti,qx80,2015,G M, 07/17/2020,Love my '15 QX80,5,"I have to start by saying that I absolutely love this vehicle. I'm a big guy (6'4"" and 275 lbs.) and this vehicle fits me like a glove. I sat in the Sequoia, which was too small, and the only other one I found a comfortable position is was the Chev, but I couldn't bring myself to buy a GM. Many others have said it, but if you're worried about gas mileage you shouldn't be driving this vehicle. 

Love all of the features, the power, and the ride. My favorite part is the look. They nailed this one and I've gotten a lot of compliments from co-workers on the styling and the interior, even now in 2020. I have to mention that this is also one of the few third rows that I even fit in. 

My wife, who is shorter than me, isn't afraid to drive this vehicle despite its size due to the 360 cameras, and the ease of steering. To put it into perspective, she was afraid to drive the FJ cruiser I had before this because it was too big. 

I've had this for 25k km and haven't had any issues yet. The review about the gas gauge is accurate but so what? when the light comes on, you know you have 7 gallons left. To me that was not a show stopper. If you keep on the regular maintenance, it shouldn't be an issue. 

I would buy this vehicle again in a heart beat.

Cadillac, Toyota, Ford, GM, Lincoln, etc... and were impressed by the fit and finish of the exterior and interior of this ""Limited"" model. (We were so disappointed in the Lincoln-- it seemed 20 years out of date. That said, this vehicle, ON PAPER, is great. This vehicle, in REALITY, is grossly overpriced for the ownership experience. I cannot believe how bad the GPS is (and that the dealer charges us to update the software for a car this expensive). If you buy this car, purchase a Garmin or other GPS. The efforts required to operate the instruments require extensive training and review. In general, you should NEVER do anything more than change channels on the radio without pulling over. (If you want the most intuitive instrumentation, go with a Ford product (((no, I don't have one at the moment))) or any other choice.) We have tried two dealerships for service, and cannot recommend either. Yes, they are glamorous, but the execution of service is slow, and the knowledge of the service team is modest. For example, they don't even know the proper air pressure when asked. That's just sad. The car does draw many comments, and that's good for a chance to explain to curious onlookers that they see what we saw, but DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE. We own several cars, including domestics and exotics. This is the only car we own which I would never buy again.

infiniti,qx80,2016,Montana Visitor, 08/27/2016,2000 miles on the Range (and the mountains)!,5,"I reserved a full-size SUV with Hertz for the family trip to western Montana. We really got lucky when all they had was a QX80 at Bozeman airport. There were multiple days that we spent 6 - 8 hours in the vehicle and more than once 4+ hours at a time. We were all quite comfortable at all times. I've never driven a vehicle that was comfortable so such lengths of time. It was also a joy to drive on Montana's pothole-free highways and backroads. Handled high-speeds (in excess of 100 mph) with rock-solid stability and only a bit of wind-noise as a sign. Yes, Virginia, such speeds are completely safe on a 4-mile straight on a perfectly smooth road, with no trees in sight (you can see any cars, animals, pedestrians, etc. miles away). Fuel economy seemed fine - it's a big SUV with a powerful V8! Also, I'm used to driving full-size trucks with V8s so I knew what to expect. Was disappointed, but not surprised when I confirmed the price is more than I'm willing to spend. Can't justify $70k+ in the northeast where our vehicles are bathed in corrosive salt-spray 5 months per year. Very happy to learn the 2017 Nissan Armada is basically the QX80 with slightly fewer features, Nissan badges, and $15k cheaper. The Armada will be first on my list when we need to replace a vehicle. P.S. I picked ""Limited"" trim level because Edmunds wouldn't allow me to skip it. I'm not sure which trim level I drove.

Gas mileage is in a word, horrible, but if you are paying a grand a month for your car $60-80 a month in gas is probably not a worry. Safety and tech are top notch, accelerates nicely and is a pleasure to drive. Plus I am saving 200/month vs a MB that is similarly equipped. I looked around, Hard, this was far and away the best bang for the buck. Cadillac felt cheap inside(PLASTIC AS FAR AS THE EYE CAR SEE) the same car from MB is way overpriced, and doesn't exist for Audi, BMW, Porsche or Lexus. I even tried the Lexus 540 which felt tiny in comparison and everything else was soo much smaller or no where near as nice (Yukon, Tahoe, Expedition). This is also far more comfortable than any previous vehicle I have owned (MB E350 Wagon, RR HSE, Yukon Denali and Dodge Durango) and is probably only beaten in value of all cars I have owned by my Porsche (550 Spyder).

infiniti,qx80,2016,Car Enthusiast, 03/01/2018,2 Day Drive to the Mountains,2,"Rented this car for a 2 day mountain trip.  When I first stepped into the car, the traction control off light was on.  The car also shifts really weird in Auto, 4H or 4L modes.  It either jerks you right off your seat when you step on it or shifts too quickly to where you can feel the automatic transmission shifting 5x in one second.  Brakes were also difficult to control as the downshifting also made the car jerk as it is slowing down.  Car reached 5200rpm at 72 mph, with a redline at about 6200rpm, which made me afraid to push the car any harder as I was afraid it might blow up at a higher speed.  This big SUV also loves to guzzle gas and we were down to a quarter of a tank after 2.5 hr drive.  The visibility to the outside was good and it was comfortable for passengers not in the back row, but the interior was kind of small considering the huge size of the car.  Barely able to fit 6 adults with luggage.  HVAC is finickly and seems to be ""hunting"" the correct setpoint temperature as you get frequent waves of hot air followed by cold air without touching the controls.

infiniti,qx80,2016,Harry M, 02/18/2019,No repairs needed since new.,5,"The window sticker was just below $90,000, so it was not inexpensive. The handling and traction in northern NY is as good as it gets. The ride quality is a little rough, but in return you get excellent road handling for a 6000 lb. vehicle. Nothing has ever needed repair now up to 37,000 miles. We replaced the windshield wipers.  Bought 4 new tires at 34,999 miles, $1,200. We only get about 17 MPG on highway at 70 MPH, and 15 MPG around our rural area. The drivers controls are rather odd to a person used to American cars like us, making it quite difficult to figure things out like how to turn on the windshield wipers, use the navigation aid system, etc. Some of the controls, like the heat/air controls for the seats, are very hard to read. The port for a thumb drive is located in a compartment too short , requiring a special short length thumb drive. The rear storage with the 3rd row seats down is not flat. To use the tow hitch, you must remove a plastic panel, leaving an extremely ungainly gaping hole. The seat upholstery is the best we have seen and all the interior roof, side, pillars etc. are covered in what appears to be suede leather.Very nice, very classy. The comfort of long trips (we drive 1300 miles to Florida) is outstanding, one of the best we ever experienced. Highway driving is effortless and very quiet. Overall, we love this SUV and would definitely buy another QX 80 in a couple more years. This is only our second foreign car and we are very positively impressed.

We purchased our 2017 QX80 in 2017 and I have been driving over a year.  It's been great so far.  My wife and I were really surprised about the maneuverability compared with our MDX.  It's a big vehicle but is quite responsive and does not drive like a truck.  The cabin is quiet and comfortable.  My wife thought it was big at first but after driving a couple of times she is perfectly comfortable with the larger size.  The QX80 responds more like a mid-size SUV.   It fits in our garage fine and accommodates 6 comfortably.   Access to the third row seating is excellent as the 2nd row seats allow for easy access.  Now that my wife is working from home more frequently (with me), she is now prefers driving our QX80.  As do I...  Our daughter will get the MDX soon and I suspect we might need another QX80.  It's our first Infiniti and I can say it will not be our last.  I have found it to be a solid vehicle and have been extremely impressed with the Infiniti Dealership.  We have had absolutely no problems with it.  The storage space is excellent with the third row down and provides the additional space we needed.  I am happy with the Bose sound system and although the MP3 USB utilization is a bit outdated with old FAT table limitations.  It works fine if you structure the music library accordingly.  We did not want the full entertainment system package so I cannot comment about that.  I was able to get the front to play AVI but it requires some tech know-how for the video formatting.  I find my IPad with streaming more efficient anyway.  Really the only downside is the gas consumption compared to our  previous MDX although I doubt it's worse than any other V8 in it's class.  I get about 12.5-13.5mpg around town.  It does much better on the highway but I rarely need to drive long distances anymore.  We love it!

Didn't actually look at the Navagator except online, it's also too pricey.Engine and transmission of the qx80 nicely compliment one another and performance power is more than adequate for a 3 ton suv. Got nearly every option except the Deluxe Technology package. Go check one out.

infiniti,qx80,2018,Avid Driver, 09/12/2018,Best Full Size Luxury SUV......,5,"The QX 80 by far is the best luxury SUV out there. The power, the gas mileage the comfort, safety and off course the ride. It is the absolutely the best value for its money. the gas mileage in the city is 16 and in the highway is 19-20......(Recently took it to Florida from Texas). You know what else is best about this luxury SUV, it takes regular gas and don't have pounce on the premium gas (recommended though for optimum performance). Towing is amazing also and even though it comes with RWD, it has snow and tow mode. Leather and quality are great.

I do not use the back up mirror. Being retired, I do alot of traveling mainly up and down the east coast and through the mountains of the Carolinas, Virginia, Pa and New England. It has never let me down. I trade every 40,000 miles. My only wish is they have a reduced inventory to choose from and very little info as to when new models are available. Add three more inches to the front seats.

infiniti,qx80,2018,TAINS, 03/19/2019,Increased Luxury over Usability,3,"If you need a large vehicle to just move people or tow something this is a great stylish comfortable vehicle but if you are a weekender who heads to the cabin with all their gear and family it may not be what you need.  My previous vehicle was a 2008 QX56 that was one of the best vehicles I've owned, no issues, problems or complaints.   Plenty of comfort, storage, versatility and usability so most of what I am doing here is comparing back to that vehicle.   What you loose with the QX80 is the larger storage area's in and around the cabin.  You loose rear storage cu. ft., you loose the ability to easily remove the 2nd row center council for pet beds or to put long items in through the rear.  Why do these vehicle makers think that it's ok to not have completely flat fold down rear seats, your storage in back is now at an angle compared to old QX56.   Infiniti also reduced the hideaway storage in the back where you put your trailer hitch when not in use.  Do they not understand that you also need to put other things back there like straps and such?  They also remove the side storage compartment in the back as well that was nice to hide things in when you stopped someplace and did not want someone to see it, like your wife's purse.  Stupid things Infiniti did was things like putting the heated steering wheel button low and down to the left so it's hard to get at and see.  Rear entertainment that has two headrest mounted screens only has one HDMI input in the back so the kids can only watch one thing at a time from their phones or other peripherals.  Why did they change the volume button to be different then the source button on the steering wheel, you can find the source button without looking but finding the flat volume button is harder; what one do you use more?  They put this over sized knob for switching into 4wd down by the shifter but make you have to reach to the control knob for the menu system on the dash; which one do you think you use more here?   Removing the trailer hitch cover is overly complicated and needs to be re-engineered.   Performance is great, power is substantial, fit and finish is great, shifting is not as smooth as I think it should be but it's ok and is something to get used to.  Getting in and out is not as easy as the old QX56, seat adjustments is not as good I think and mirrors are smaller in some ways that make things tougher when backing up trailers.

infiniti,qx80,2018,Gretchen, 05/04/2019,Can’t get comfortable on short flat seat,3,"This is a beautiful car, but it should be more comfortable. The front seat is so short, there’s no thigh support. I’m a tall female, and have been fighting knee issues since taking over driving duties of this car. The seat sits high like a bus, and my knee and thighs are always under pressure. Moreover, the break pedal is 2.5” higher and 3” away from the accelerator, so I’m constantly moving my right leg, and twisting the knee and ankle to access the pedals. I’ve built up the floor of the vehicle by placing two towels under the floor mat, which is a modest improvement. Am looking at getting the break pedal adjusted. I’ve owned over a dozen cars, and never once thought about the pedal placement. The lumbar support is so low on my back, it actually causes the spine to curl rather than extend. I use a third towel for lumber, which doesn’t feel very luxurious. Driving this car in town is a chore,not a pleasure. Too bad, it’s a pretty beast with a nice engine. I prefer experiencing Infiniti as the passenger.

I'm very disappointed with the QX80 2018: Quality of the backup camera and the 360 degrees cameras, this is by far the worst quality of cameras in the car market! It looks like a camera from 10 years ago. The car also love gas too much, I'm averaging 11 miles in the city and 13.5 in the highway, I had big engine cars all my life and this car is the worst in that department. You would expect when you pay over 75k for a car with normal backup camera, that's my biggest complaint with the car!!! At night you can’t even see anything

I’m a tall female, and without thigh support it doesn’t take long for hips, knees and back to ache. The other issue is the lumbar support, it’s so low that it actually cups your back rather than supporting the lumbar arch. What a shame. It’s hard to enjoy the smooth ride of this car when everything aches. I wish we had bought the Tahoe or Yukon.

infiniti,qx80,2018,Tom Baudhuin, 03/26/2019,very disappointed - reliability is not good.,2,"I owned three Nissan Armadas and liked them.   My wife got an Infiniti 60 and was happy.   I thought I would step up with a little nicer finish.   What a mistake.   the 2018 Infiniti QX80 has had several problems.     For example, while driving down the road a piece of windshield trim starts flapping on the side of the car.    When I talk to Infiniti they responded ""it might be under warranty, but I need to drive it 1 1/2 to inspect and possibly order the trim.    Then bring it back to fix.   The car is less then a year old.     They don't allow Nissan dealers to work on the vehicle.   I understand the distance issue is my problem, but I have had three issues and have given up on even considering a warranty repair.    Very disappointing and I will not be buying Infiniti in the future.    I will say the Armadas were great vehicles.

infiniti,qx80,2019,Murray, 02/05/2020,QX number 2,4,"Its is my seconf QX since the updated body. I had a 2011 QX56 (Vin 1499). In case you didn't know, The first 1500 of these had bad timing chain tensioners and oiling issues. Mine started to rattle at about 83000 miles. Infiniti was VERY good to me and offered me a nice trade as well as a very nice price to move into my 2016 QX80.

There isn't much difference over the years with these. Only the seat stitching was different. Both had the Technology and Theatre packages.Don't waste your money on the Theater package. Its difficult to use and I never used the one in my 2016. The headphones are still in the original plastic wrap! Other than the bad engine in the 56, both have been mechanically flawless. Tires every 36000 ,iles, Brakes (which are VERY good BTW) at about 60000 miles. 

They are huge, quiet and comfortable. Plenty of room for whatever you may need to put inside. They do drink lots of fuel. Mine averaged about 9 mpg in the city but I got as much as 23 mpg on long trips. These are no sports cars. The lean in turns, are heavy and 400hp is just enough. The only thing I didn't like about them is the transmission. The shift points are just all wrong. I assume its programmed to shift where it does to save fuel, But it just feels wrong.Down shifting itself on the highway with the cruise on is crazy! 7th to 3rd going up a hill is a bit much. 

For the price I'd like to see them do better with the leather coloring. Mine in sand or wheat or whatever they want to call it this year, wore off of the steering wheel fairly early in its life. The gold piping on the seats also comes off pretty quickly though I will say, its not noticeable unless you really look at it and know what you are looking for.

While the paint seems to look pretty good, it is fairly soft. Not as soft as Audi, but its soft. Water spots are deep and take some serious detailing to remove on the black paint. I didn't notice it as much on the dark current QX56 though.

Depreciation is pretty rough on these. $90k sticker and 3.5 years later its only worth about $32k. Not great in my book. It had been updated significantly since 2016 though. I personally don't like the look of the new ones.

I decided to get something bigger for family use to travel comfortably. The ride quality and interior are excellent, safety systems work great! Reliability keeps me coming back to the brand as all of my INFINITI products have been flawless! This is a very comfortable long distance cruiser, the rear seat entertainment is easy to use and the heated/cooled seats work quick. Leather quality is good and is resistant to discoloring (I have the wheat colored quilted leather). Overall the only knock is the technology is badly outdated but still does the basics. Gas mileage is predictable for a large naturally aspirated V8, the sound it makes is great and has strong, smooth acceleration!

infiniti,qx80,2019,zeph, 09/19/2020,Cruise Control anomalies,3,"We have owned this vehicle for 5 months now due to Covid only driven about 5000 miles. We have noticed that issue with the cruise control as described by others here. You'll be cruising at -say- 70 mph and the engine is just purring along at under 2000RPM. Then there is a slight incline in the road, and the gearbox kicks down two gears, the engine revs up to over 5000RPM! Only when the incline has passed will it return to normal. This is very odd and disconcerting, and the mechanic at the dealer felt the same. However, they were issued a directive by Infiniti stating :
""This is normal operating characteristic of the vehicle that has been reported in multiple cases. 
No further diagnosis should be performed.""

So that's that, I guess. Otherwise it is a fine truck, if you can live with the size and fuel economy. 

The only other niggle I have is that the fuel gauge will indicate empty and when you fill up it takes just 20 gallons. Spec sheet says the size of the fuel tank is 26, so it signals empty with 6 gallons left in the tank.

Although, the car is under warranty, Infiniti will not cover the cost to replace three sensors which have paint chipping from usual wear and tear from driving, thus setting off the sensor. $1500 to replace three.

infiniti,qx80,2020,Anthon, 06/22/2020,But an Armada instead,3,"This suv is very luxurious and really nice inside, but it is based on a 10 year old platform.  That being said it feels somewhat cheap and not much different from a Nissan.  I only had this car for a weekend as a rental, and don’t get me wrong, it’s very comfortable, but in the long run I would not love it.  Even though I had the base model Luxe, I was surprised at some features it lacked.  Some include air conditioned seats, heated rear seats, an entertainment system, and a pretty standard audio system.  I am being a little nit picky, but a $70,000 suv should have more than it does.  My 2007 Acura has better sound, and you could get air conditioned seats on a Tahoe ten years ago.  Overall, I like the QX80, but there are some areas it could be improved.  You may as well save $30k and get an armada instead.
"
infiniti,qx80,2020,AG, 01/05/2021,Questionable SUV,3,"I got this vehicle as a loaner while my Suburban is in body shop. 
Well, there are couple of good things about this vehicle and bunch that I wasn't too crazy about.
First is when you open the door and release door handle, the door makes this hollow tin can noise like in 20K car.
Then you step on the running board and it bends under your weight. I'm only 185#. I can only imagine that 300# guy will steep on it and rip it off 😒
Buttons and some controls aren't as intuitive as BMW, MB or Suburban.
Driving quality is okay for the most part but if you hit a pothole, rear end will bounce and step sideways slightly. I don't think it's acceptable for a vehicle in this price range.
Touch screens take 2-3 touches to activate, change channels or use climate control.
My wife's previous lexus had way better touch screen.
Other thing that really bugs me is the small gas tank...
You will barely get over 200 miles on 3/4 of the tank with 4 people in the vehicle and nothing in tow.
I know, you don't buy this rig to worry about gas mileage but come on, my previous GL had this consumption towing 6000# trailer.
This thing barely gets over 13mpg on the highway keeping up with traffic.
My '16 Suburban gets 19mpg on the highway all day long and I can drive for 600 miles on a tank of gas on the highway. With QX you will be stopping every 300 miles.
I don't know but some people like captain seats in 2nd row.
Not my thing at all, you can't fit long item because it sticks out when you fold second row.
The transmission feels like CVT and its doesn't have good solid feel to it.

So, in the end I'm glad I experienced this vehicle and now know that I will not consider it, ever.
You will get better vehicle with GL/GLS, even Tahoe/Burban is better.

infiniti,ex35,2008,Jimji, 01/03/2016,More fun than FX,4,"This is a fun but luxurious car to drive which is what I wanted as my old gti was too low and dangerous for the mountains of Colorado in the Winter. Needed something I could drive all year but was still fun and wouldn't beat me up for longer drives. Tried a similar year FX and was sadly disappointed. Its possible it needed some front end work as it was used but the salesman who showed me the Ex said he thought I would notice the difference in handling over bumps in the road. He was right it was huge. The Ex also felt quicker and being smaller easier to change directions with. Both vehicles felt miles above the same year Bmw x3 which felt slow and harsher over the bumps. I am single so always just leave the rear seats folded down so the back seat room is  a non issue for me. Not sure about the handling in Winter conditions yet as my tires need replacing and hitting icy spots is kind of scary right now. The EX3 is so nice on the highway when I want to pass another car as it accelerates really well. I just wish there wasn't that slight lag before the power comes on but its reasonable. I will say that the old gti with the little turbo was more fun to ring out going up the mountain passes here. The 3.4 6 banger might actually be faster if I want it to be but it just doesn't like to be revved to the max like the little turbo and isn't quite as fun going around the turns but then it is a lot more comfortable doing it. 

Owned for about 9 months now. Still no problems and still liking it.

Not any problems after 3 years. In fact never in the shop yet.

The car itself is a total pleasure to drive under any conditions - from ""endless"" acceleration if you floor it to very sharp handling on a curvy road, to very quiet and smooth ride on a regular street or freeway. Extremely quiet cabin and excellent Bose audio with XM makes trips much less tiresome. Cruise control that can literally stop a car when a car in front of it stops is surprisingly useful even on a city street. Voice recognition understands my accent. But above all - give it a little gas to burn and feel acceleration that presses you into the seat - it stays constant while you go from 0 to 80, I don't even feel tranny switching.  Yeah!"

The backseat is a little small for passengers but the front seating area is roomy (I'm 6 ft. 2).  The technology features like the push button fold down of rear seats and push button start are enjoyable.   Wind noise is a little loud both with the sunroof open or driver/passenger windows down.  All in all, I'm happy I purchased this vehicle."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Car Buff, 05/23/2009,This Crossover/SUV thingy is awesome...,5,"Everyone,  I am a car buff. I research cars for months before I buy one. I always buy new cars that are from an awesome manufacturers. I test drive dozens of cars before I buy. I have to say that I love, love, love this car. It is very nice inside. It looks like a Lexus and feels likes a BMW. No joke. The quality is outstanding. The engine rev is awesome. I really like all the technology that this car has with it. The safety is number one in my book. Star ratings of 5 and 4 is very good. I like the look, style, functionality and ease of use for everything. The dual climate control is a must. The NAV and cameras are also awesome. I am very well pleased.  "
infiniti,ex35,2008,jjohnson, 12/03/2009,Best car I've ever owned,4,"When my lease was up on the BMW 325i I was interested in something slightly larger with more amenities.  I considered the X3 but the price difference for a similarly equipped BMW was roughly 13k so opted for the more elegantly-styled EX35 and cannot be happier.  I average 22mpg in heavy city/hills driving so that's not bad given the 305hp V6 performance.  Fit and finish is as good as my BMW and having hands-free bluetooth, leather interior, power seats w/ memory, etc. included underscores the point over the $13k difference in the German counterparts. Infiniti has built a great urban-sized crossover with superb styling, performance and features."
infiniti,ex35,2008,PROBLEMS GALORE, 05/13/2010,PROBLEMS GALORE,3,"I purchased my ex35 the first year it was out thinking its an infiniti I would have no problems. I have has several recalls on the car. Very unreliable, the delarship has wrecked it two times, being southwest infiniti! I have 19,000 miles on it and the brakes on the rear have gone out. They have refaced the rotars two times and will not cover this under warranty. Motor in the mirror for the tilt down option has broke, power steering collum has gone out. I had to replace the battery at 6 months old. The list goes on. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER INFINITI. Its supposed to be a luxury brand and its just a nissan! Save your time and headaches!!! "
infiniti,ex35,2008,edward, 08/23/2008,Luxury and performance - love it!,4,"After 15+ years driving bmws, saabs, and mercs, I had to go Japanese.  The true cost of ownership was killing me. I love the look of the European cars, and the way you can really feel the road when you accelerate & corner.  So I didn't want to give up performance or styling when giving up euro.  And Infiniti didn't disappoint in either category.  Wow this car is fantastic.  Still in the honeymoon phase (1st month) but I can already tell that I made the right decision.  I'm so happy with this car!         "
infiniti,ex35,2008,alfie, 02/28/2009,Nice Crossover,4,"Bought it new in 12/08... it's great for wife and I since kids are long gone. We have the back seats down all the time to get enough room for the trips to Costco. The hill in front of our NJ house was awful this winter... snow, snow, ice, ice and more snow. The EX was terrific getting us up the hill to Panera's for breakfast. List price was $40.8K, bought it for $30.5K with no Infiniti financing. $10.3K off the list! Bernie at Ramsey Infiniti was a good guy to work with. So far the MPG is around 19... not bad/not great. We bought the black exterior with the brown interior... good choice. Our family has owned 10 Infinitis from the old slow auto G20's to the new EX. 4 yr/ 60K warranty is great."
infiniti,ex35,2008,PL, 01/06/2008,2008 Infiniti EX35,3,Wanted a sports car but needed more function.  I found the EX almost as fun to drive as the G37 with a much smoother ride & a semi-useful back seat.  Much more refined than Acura RDX & considerably less expensive than BMW X3. 
infiniti,ex35,2008,Broudie, 06/22/2009,From a Honda / Toyota Owner,4,"I love the way the EX looks. It is probably one of the best looking vehicles in the entry luxury segment. And with the comparative rarity, you are in the unique position of people staring admiringly at what is essentially a short sporty station wagon. Toyota/Lexus and Honda/Acura have nothing on this car from the looks department.  I love the car's split personality. When driven sedately, its like a luxo-crusier. High seating position, fine appointments, quiet ride and good stereo is made for eating thousands of miles in comfort. But when you decide to gun it, the V6 comes alive and pushes you to the back of your seat. And with the excellent handling, it's hard not to want to drive fast."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Jay, 09/01/2009,Disappointed,3,"I bought this car in June with high expectations.  I have been sorely disappointed.   Most recently (with 1800 miles on the car) the battery died.  The seat warmers also did not work.  When they were ""fixed"" the heat was so low that I could often not even tell the warmers were on.  The storage space is really limited and the gas mileage is worse than expected.  Infiniti is also a pain to deal with--even as my car was in the shop with problems, Infiniti was more focused on selling me another car than solving my issues.  What I like is the styling, engine power and cool features like the rear facing camera.  But I really had much higher expectations for this car.  Not recommended."

I feel safe and snug. EX is the perfect size for me..only being 5 feet tall I feel like I'm above everyone, which I love. It's a great amount of space for what I need. It's powerful, beautiful looking, and a gem. I had looked at the EX, X3, Tiguan, Land Rover LR2, and Volvo XC60. I am very happy with my decision and I'm constantly wanting to drive my car. "

It gets poor millage, the plastic siding on the doors starts to fall off, the keys loose their programming and there is no backup way to start the car. Every non-core feature is a disaster and makes the vehicle a miserable thing to own.

The best things about my EX and all my Infinitis include good gas mileage on regular no lead fuel, excellent safety features (my FX was destroyed and I walked away) and the fact that I have NEVER had to take any of my cars in for a single warranty claim. My EX is comfortable, powerful and fun to drive. I am a big guy and I am very comfortable in the car. The nav is easy to use and I like the handling and the AWD system that is intuitive and adds to the ride and handling.  "
infiniti,ex35,2008,lifonedg , 08/04/2008,Still a few kinks to work out,4,"I have had my EX for 4 months.  I was told by the Infiniti dealer that the car could run on regular gas and that is what I have run.  I traded a G35 which I only put premium in for 4 years!  I have had no problems with the car running on regular, and was told it would not void my warranty."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Infinite Owner, 09/01/2008,Love the new EX,4,"We owned a G35 sedan and was T-boned by a FT-150 Ford diesel truck and totaled my car.  I decided to try something different and test drove BMW, Mercedes, and the new 09 Nissan Maxima and I didn't find what I was looking for.  Needless to say the Infiniti has spoiled me.  Went into the dealership and ended up falling in love with the EX.  Great seats, love the ride and the quiet cabin.  We ended up getting one that was totally loaded and am so happy we did.  Love the visibility when in reverse and absolutely love the iPod capability.  I had to come back to the Infiniti, the G35 was like a rock when we were hit by that BIG truck.  Me and my 2 1/2 year old walked away without a scratch.  "
infiniti,ex35,2008,Beth Lomasky, 09/21/2008,Love my EX35,4,"Have had 3 Maximas in a row. Wanted a crossover with 4 wheel drive. Test drove BMW, Lexus, Acura and the EX35.  Loved the EX35 as soon as I drove it.  Mine is fully loaded.  Wondered about the gas - my dealer told me to buy the middle priced gas but have been reading some of you are using the regular-no lead gas.  The iPod connection makes it so easy to listen to my favorite music."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Andy Matheson, 10/05/2008,Great compromise,4,"My wife needed to replace her 4 year old BMW 3-series convertible. Some reliability issues and serious aquaplaning in Florida's wet summers made us look at a different kind of vehicle. The EX has been perfect and both my wife and I love the car. It looks great in moonlight white with graphite interior, the navigation system is wonderful (my wife has no sense of direction and is not the most confident of drivers, but the sat-nav always gets her to her destination). The build quality is excellent. All-in-all, a great and exceptional buying and ownership experience so far. Long may it continue. Other manufacturers just couldn't come up with the goods."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Katiedaddy, 12/31/2008,The most stylish Station Wagon on earth,4,"I bought this car after comparing with BMW X3 and Acura RDX and I believe I made a wise decision.  Although both cars did have more space, EX35 is much more appealing to look at and more fun to drive.  This car handles and accelerates like a sports car while ride quality matches that of typical luxury sedan and braking power is very strong.  I really can't complain about this car beside its lack of space in the back which drives my wife nuts every time since she has to sit in the back with my 2 year old daughter.  But I do believe once she gets old enough to be out of her car seat, my wife will stop complaining.  I can only barely fit 2 golf bags in the trunk."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Myca, 02/03/2009,100% worth it!,4,"I used to drive a Lexus IS 300 and was looking to purchase another similar car.  Naturally, I was looking at the usual suspects (BMW 3-series, Acura TL, Lexus IS 350).  I felt the BMW was overpriced for what I was getting.  The new TLs exterior was too overwhelming for me (I'm a petite female).  I loved my Lexus IS 300, and truly believe in Lexus as a quality car manufacturer with unbeatable service, but I wanted to try something with a little more edge.  I found the perfect balance in the EX!  I get a nice drive (like a BMW), with all the bells and whistles (like a Lexus), with a unique exterior.  It's my favorite car so far."
infiniti,ex35,2008,RMS, 02/05/2009,Great car!!,4,"We bought our EX about a month ago and all I can say is wow! There is nothing disappointing about this vehicle. It is the most comfortable, quiet, fun to drive vehicle I've owned.  Great power in the engine -- there when you need it and also when you just want to have fun.  Super stereo sound, love the gadgets - not difficult to figure out and use. Love the voice system and nav. Gas mileage is much better than we thought - avg seems to be 25 mpg which is better than advertised.  If you want a fun, small suv (oh and it works great in snow and ice) this is a great choice.  "
infiniti,ex35,2008,Gerry, 02/18/2009,MY 2008 INFINITI EX35 JOURNEY,4,"Beautiful crossover, lots of power; mileage reasonable, strong engine, smooth 5 speed automatic transmission.  The 2008 Infiniti EX35 is the first car I have ever driven that is great on gas, lots of passing power and strong torque.  Love it. Car is worth owning."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Iamluvinit, 01/23/2008,Fits the bill,4,"I was quite torn between the G35 sedan and the EX and I am more than happy with my decision to buy the EX. Since '03 I have driven a G35 (03), then moved to a big SUV the Nisaan Armada (04) and now the EX (4 days) all equipped with the premium and navigation packages.  Then is by far the best of the three. I love the ride comfort and quite nature of the cabin when taking it easy and, when pushed, it responds like a sport machine. The engine is quite thirsty but, consistent with pretty much all variations of this powerplant. Not much space (think large coupe). The touch screen nav is easy and fun to use. Would highly recommend for those that can live with the space limitations.  "
infiniti,ex35,2008,EXdriver, 10/25/2009,Noise,3,The biggest complaint I have for this car is the high-pitch noise every time the car starts and accelerates. This is a pretty common problem according to online forums. Infiniti hasn't fixed it and not one of the service mechanics have heard it. I like to drive without the radio but that's not a possibility because of the noise. I am considering trading in this car for the 2009 Buick Enclave.
infiniti,ex35,2008,nceric, 01/17/2010,AWD EX35,4,"Bought 7 months ago and couldn't be more pleased.  Handles great, comfortable around town and on long trips.

infiniti,ex35,2008,jeda21, 05/27/2010,EX 35 Sleek and Zippy,4,"I was looking for a compact SUV or wagon for about a year and a half and I found what I was looking for in this car. It's excellently designed, very comfortable, and drives like a sports car--particularly around corners. It's a fluid and comfortable ride either in the city or the highway.  The rear seat is cramped but cargo is adequate for my needs when I pull down the rear seat. If you need space for people and cargo this is not the car for you."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Theresa, 02/04/2008,Love it,5,"I went from a Navigator to the EX35. I love the handling and the ride is exceptional. The interior is beautful with roomy front driver/passenger area. Yes, the back seats  seem short on space but my 6'1"" husband said he was very comfortable on a recent trip. "
infiniti,ex35,2008,Manny, 02/24/2008,A Definite 10,4,"If you are an SUV owner and are thinking of buying this vehicle, you will have to reconsider the definition. Yes, it is a higher off the ground and yes, it has room in the back, but no this car will be more at home at the symphony than in woods. I bought mine a few weeks back -- it's the sweetest, most luxurious ride I've ever had. It's beyond comfortable, techonologically an Einstein and it handles like butta! It is incredibly user friendly and at first I thought it might be too elegant for me, but I got over that quickly. The back seat is not the largest, but it is comfortable. The prem. and nav. package were well worth it. City gas = 18.5 mpg which ain't bad. Great job Infiniti!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,danevick, 04/04/2008,Short people will love it!,4,"Being a former owner of an Infiniti fx35, I eagerly awaited the ex35. I was impressed with virtually everything about the vehicle. The ride was much improved over the choppy, kidney busting ride of my FX. Build quality, materials, everything great. The only thing that kept me from owning one on the spot was the lack of rear seat room. No one except leg children under 5 will be able to ride in the back. A huge disappointment for an Infiniti fan like me. But if you have no friends or kids, this is worth looking at. Also, ground clearance is no better than a car, so forget about offroading, much less jumping a curb in parking lots."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Randy, 05/03/2008,Update on prior review,4,"A month ago I reviewed my new EX35 and gave it a glowing review. But didn't like the mileage or the fact that it requires premium fuel.  I have now had an opportunity to take a road trip, pleasantly, my mileage numbers have improved. I am averaging 21 now vs 16.5 in the 1st month.  Also, I took two female adults on this 6 hour trip and they both raved about the comfort of the back seat. I wouldn't want to ask a guy to do this, I wouldn't, but the ladies were fine with it. Also my Bluetooth is hooked up and it is fantastic!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,Young Father, 05/06/2008,Awesome car pure Luxurious.,4,"Now this is luxury. This car was perfect for my family. My wife and I are in our mid 20s and we have a 4 month old baby. Drives amazingly and the interior is the best I have ever seen (for the price range). The exterior makes everyone's head turn every where I go. The automatic fold down seats are the coolest ever and all the other interior add-ons really make this car great to ride in. The only down side is the MPG really stinks in the city or stop and go traffic and the cargo room really is small. The cargo space only fits our full size Stokke stroller and the grocery has to go all around it.  The engine runs great and powerful off the line, great handling at highway speeds and curves."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Chuck Cheetham, 05/25/2008,Awesome,4,"Test drove everything in the crossover category from the X6 to the Tiguan. Nothing in my opinion combined the styling, luxury, performance, and tech features of the EX35. Think of it as a GTI for adults, if you don't need a lot of space, take a serious look. The ultimate driving machine for less money. I have the Journey AWD, nav. and permium package with lux style. Moonlight white w/ graphite int. Great looking vehicle. Getting many compliments from strangers at the pump. I'm 6'2"" and very comfortable while driving, my daughters have enough room in the rear seat. My golf clubs also fit in the hatch, room for another set without folding the rear seats. "
infiniti,ex35,2008,TRH, 05/30/2008,Great crossover,5,"Have about 3700 miles on car and love it. Only thing I needed to do was tint windows, I live in FL. This changed the look of the vehicle (white) from the outside and helps cut down the brightness inside. Avg gas mileage around town just over 20, highway avg little over 25 ... I'm happy!  Single guy, so leg room in back seat is not big concern to me."

I am a big tall guy and have no problem sitting comfortably at front seats. The back seats are kind of small and Infiniti should add optional sliding back seats in 09 model. Highly recommended.
infiniti,ex35,2008,lfaraci, 04/16/2010,Fun but not reliable,3,"I bought my EX35 about a year ago and got a steal on it!  I saved tons of money and got the name ""Infiniti"" to go with it. Although, it has left me stranded two times where it will not start. Roadside assistance has towed it to the dealer where the battery was replaced once and today, they have no idea what is wrong. ""Something is draining the battery."" My first infiniti and my last. My Honda never left me stranded in 6 years; this one, twice in a year. Very disappointed in this car's reliability. Great low price, but not at the expense of being stranded with a little one."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Mike , 12/28/2008,Great Car,5,I finally convinced my reluctant wife to trade her 2005 Solara convertible for the EX35. I have an FX45 and tried to convince her that AWD was of more value than a convertible on which we have had the top down 3 time in the last year. Well the day after we picked it up we had an ice storm and now she is a believer. She loves the car and so do I. I'm trying to convince her to let me have the EX and she can drive my FX. So far no luck.
infiniti,ex35,2008,RCH, 08/02/2009,"Love the car, but it has warts",4,"I have owned the EX35 for 18 months. It has 12k miles on it. Have had no significant service issues with the car. I like the overall driving experience of the car. Handles like a sports sedan vs an SUV. Looks are subjective, but it has grown on me. The car has developed annoying interior squeaks and rattles, dealer cannot locate them.  The car gets HORRIBLE mileage, like avg of 16.5.  I've never cracked 20 mpg in 18 months.  With the cost of premium fuel this is a serious deficiency of the car - IMHO. It's NOT due to my driving style. Had I known of this mileage issue I would not have purchased the EX35. Sorry Infiniti - I like it - I don't love it. "
infiniti,ex35,2008,Mike, 01/06/2009,Great Car for the Money,4,"I had to do some hard selling to talk my wife out of her Toyota Solara Convertible and into a SUV but luckily we had an ice storm the day after we picked it up and she absolutely loves the AWD. I have an FX-45 and this car has it beat in spades when it comes to features and interior luxury. True my FX is 5 model years old but the EX is a truly great car for the bucks. Rides like a luxury car, handles like a sports car. Just what Infiniti was aiming for. We're ""empty nesters"" so the lack of back seat leg room is not a problem. If we need to haul friends we take the FX."
infiniti,ex35,2008,califman, 06/17/2008,Love it!,4,"I love this car. I looked at Audi, BMW, and Lexus. None of their cars grabbed me like the EX.

The worse thing is the 6000-k (3600- Miles) requirement for servicing where all other manufacturers are 8000-k (5000-M) is Infiniti inferior?   BMW with Mobil-1 was 24000-Km.

Cargo room is exactly what I need and though there are complaints about the space in the back seat, I had 2 rugby playing friends in the back seat and they said the room was fine.  I do think it would be tough to get 3 people in the back seat.  Storage is not bad and it what I expected.   I saw that the service intervals are 3750K miles, but  my driving habits are more like the alternate schedule, so I plan on getting an oil change every 500K miles  "

I can cruise on the freeway and pass quickly. Gotta be careful! It's quite a bit smaller than what I am used to driving but yeah, it took me the ride home from the dealer to accept it.  Great car, rides like ""buttah"" and tons of fun. Just the back seat is small. Not horribly small but not for a long drive with adults.  I plan on getting another EX when this lease is up. They can't improve too much on this baby.  I'm having waaaaaay too much fun!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,Bill Gates, 03/20/2009,So fun to drive,4,"I would not consider the EX35 as a crossover but a small station wagon rocket. It's so much fun to drive, however there's a few things I would have like to see: less wind noise, more back seat room, easier control (it takes you a week to figure out how everything works. Get rid of the LDW (lane change warning) that you have to switch off each time you start the car. I would also work on quality and get rid of rattles in dash, add foldable mirrors and change some of the plastics that looks cheap. The seats are a little short and could be more comfortable.

I have owned all makes and models of cars and never had the great time I'm having driving the EX.  This car looks great, handles fantastically and is my very favorite, hands down.  If you want to have hours of driving pleasure, please buy this car.  It's your turn now!!!!!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,jbaby, 03/24/2009,Great Little Ride,4,I have a lot of reviews on the EX35 and some people just don't like this car but we love driving our EX!  It is a perfect size for us. I know some people say the rear leg room is tight but we rarely have people in the back seat. The cargo room is ok.  The interior flow perfectly. We were looking at the Lexus RX and think the EX interior has everything in the right place. The materials are of great quality as well.  The power the car delivers is pretty good. We own a 2006 G35 coupe as well and EX does as good a job as the coupe on the highway! DS mode makes it even more fun!  The tech features on this car are great. Bluetooth works perfect every time. All systems work well together.
infiniti,ex35,2008,matt, 03/31/2009,Outstanding Vehicle,4,"Intended to buy a G37 but couldn't resist taking the EX35 out for a spin. What a great vehicle!  Outstanding driving dynamics with the additional utility of back seats that fold down for a good amount of luggage space.  The interior is truly beautiful and all the many features are intuitive and easy to use.  True, the back seat is small and not ideal for full size adults.  But we are empty nesters so this vehicle hits the mark for us.   It was a difficult choice to make between the G and the EX, but ultimately the versatility of the EX and the incentives offered by Infiniti tipped the scales.  After 2 weeks of ownership I am really pleased with the decision."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Mike, 04/01/2009,"Great looks, great performance",4,"I've had it for a year now and still love it as much as I did when I drove it off the lot.  I especially love the interior design and dash layout.  It is very classy and well organized.  The performance is also pretty amazing. Stepping down hard on the gas makes me forget I am in a crossover.  The dealer is great and has always been very detail-oriented when appeasing their customers.  I definitely recommend it if cargo space is not your highest priority, but you don't want to restricted to a smaller sedan."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Jordan O, 12/31/2007,The car I've been looking for!!,4,"I just traded my 2006 S2000 for a fully loaded EX35 and I have no regrets.  This vehicle is perfect! The outside looks like a FX35/45 and G37's offspring and the interior is nothing short of luxury. If you are looking for a vehicle that can take your friends anywhere in style quickly and safely, get one of these!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,Bizzybritt, 01/01/2008,I love this vehicle,4,"THIS CAR IS A DREAM COME TRUE!! I must say I have read some reviews by people who were let down by the EX and its rear space.  I guess I am not as picky since I had a mini cooper S before this vehicle.  I wanted something a little bigger, with a touch of sport with a luxury feel.  The car is very stylish and clean.  I would pass up a BMW, or Mercedes anyday for an Infiniti.  I think the price is very compariable to several vehicles out there that offer the same features.  I may be biased since I have always been a fan of Infiniti.  I love this vehicle.  "
infiniti,ex35,2008,Donna, 05/11/2009,What a deal!,4,"I just bought my EX35 a few hours ago after spending 3 weeks test driving EVERY comparably-priced luxury cross-over (Volvo XC60, Audi Q5, BMW X3, Acura RDX). I also test drove the Honda CR-V for the practical side of me looking to save a bundle. All in all, I know I may not have the most ""seasoned"" review, but I can say that I do not have buyer's remorse in the slightest!  I came out of a '01 Toyota Rav4, very dependable and practical for my needs at the time, so the EX35 was a steal (besides, my car was a total loss after a wreck and I needed new wheels)!  I walked in, test drove an EX35 and loved the smooth ride and quiet interior almost immediately. The huge savings sweetened the deal!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,Laurie, 01/22/2008,Couldn't ask for more!,4,"We traded a small, feel all the bumps, 2002 Audi TT for this dreamy car. As an older couple who enjoys/expects comfort and reliability from a car, the Infiniti EX35 is perfect for us. Luxurious inside, sturdy looking outside, lots of get up and go, and tons of ""toys"". We love cars, have had many, including BMW and Lexus, and this Infiniti is at the top of the list!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,Jerry, 01/22/2008,Best vehicle I've owned!,5,"If you are considering a ""crossover"", you cannot leave this one off your list. After looking for about a month I went to Infiniti and from the first minute of the test drive I knew I had to buy!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,TS, 06/17/2009,I love my new car....or crossover!!!,4,"It is so luxurious!!!  I love my new crossover.  Thanks to the bad economy-- -I was able to get almost everything--- prem, nav and lux style package for 11K under MSRP!!! I wanted the G37 but had to go for EX35---It was a better deal.  I have no regrets!!! I only had it three weeks and so far everything is great.  I did take it back to have the roof rails replaced----the paint was scraped, but even that experience was great.  The service department was nice and I had no problem waiting for my car."
infiniti,ex35,2008,jnolen, 01/22/2008,Absolutely Love It!!!!,5,"My wife needed a new vehicle, and coming from a Nissan Xterra, she wanted a much smoother ride.  So, onto the crossovers we looked. No vehicle had an edge there.  It came down to comfort, space, and well, gadgets. Yes, the EX has the smallest room of all, but for us, perfect room, and had every feature we wanted-something no other had.  6'2"" passenger had no problems sitting in the backseat. The cruise system is a must!!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,Gerry, 10/07/2009,My EX 35 Journey,4,"Fine car except when I first got this? It created a problem that took the dealership 3 days of back and forth to the shop to resolved and wouldn't have been taken care of had I not had the common sense to mention and insist on the shop mech thoroughly check all components; specially, the battery-- eventually they did at my behest and replaced the bad battery.  So far as the vehicle is concerned, it's awesome.  The 297 est. horsepower is more than enough to carry the car around even at higher level driving fully loaded.  Had the car since Oct 2008 to present with the exception of limited backseat leg space, I cannot complain.  I regret the fact that I opted out on the lane departure option."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Larry, 02/04/2008,Gadget Freak's Delight,4,"This car is simply amazing. It's got pretty much any possible gadget you could think of (with the exception of maybe rain-sensing wipers). The around-view camera makes parking in tight spots a breeze, and the acceleration is breath taking. I did a lot of research and test drives of competitors and this one is simply the best. Lexus and BMW can't come close on the gadget end, and if you don't need all the cargo room for an SUV but want to occassionally have the rear seats folded for longer objects, this is the perfect crossover. The rear leg room is definitely tight (and you may need to even push up the front seats a bit to get the back seats down) but I rarely have passengers anyway."
infiniti,ex35,2008,writernd, 02/06/2008,Infiniti EX Journey AWD,4,"Had had about four Saabs previously and was going to get a Saab convertible, when it was suggested that I try the new EX.  I thought it would be too big (I don't like SUVs).  When I saw it, I knew instantly, it was a car I would like, and would buy instead of lease."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Randy, 03/14/2008,This vehicle is impressive,4,"I've had the car for exactly one week - 400 miles.  So far I have nothing but praise.   I was looking for a G37 Coupe but just couldn't get comfortable in the heavy bolstered seats. Sales person suggested I try an EX. After a few test drives I was totally sold on the car. Bought one on the spot. It is luxurious, powerful, quiet, handles really well, comfortable and the build quality is first rate. The Bose stereo is awesome. I chose not to buy the high tech pkg but everything else is there. I love the rear view camera - what a pleasant surprise that has turned out to be. "
infiniti,ex35,2008,michelle , 03/16/2008,Best yet,4,"I am a 3rd time Infiniti buyer.  Traded in FX for EX and love this car!! I got just about everything on it but the Tech package. I have only had it for about 3 weeks, gas mileage is good (23 mpg/freeway) and love the sound system. Still figuring out all of the extras.  I did knowingly downsize - the back seats and back are much smaller than the EX and would not be comfortable for adults to sit in back seats for long drives.  Remains to be seen if I regret the smaller size.  Also, trim around wheel well needs a small adjustment as it was not installed perfectly.  Trim quality gets better every year... wood trim is nice!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,AB in MA, 03/27/2008,Happy with my EX AWD,4,"Went in looking for the G35 but when I saw the EX I loved it! Then I test drove and had to buy it. It's just the perfect size for me. Not too big of an SUV, it's really a Crossover but I did not need or want anything bigger. I'm single and rarely have rear passengers so this was a perfect fit for me. It's very luxurious yet sporty.  The build quality is excellent, top notch. Too soon to tell the gas mileage. I've only had it for 1 month and not even at 1000 miles break-in. I'm getting about 20mpg city.  "
infiniti,ex35,2008,Ed, 03/28/2008,Please don't say we're there yet...,4,"After 3K miles and 3 months of varied driving conditions, the EX is as fun as legal fun gets.  I keep looking for that one extra button that will initiate blast off to that groovy space station on 2001: A Space Odyssey.  It would fit right in.  And isn't that what a car's ultimate goal is - putting you in a special place outside the drudgery of life?  No, it's not for a family of four.  I don't ride in the backseat, so that means nothing to me. The designers got it right.  To lengthen it for rear leg room would ruin the lines of the car. So, its not the best car for the family, but when the last kid goes, this rocket should be on your short-list. Up front it's all good."
infiniti,ex35,2008,infiniti junkie, 03/28/2008,One week in,4,"I have had the EX for a week now.  I traded in a G35 coupe.  The EX is much better for getting in and out of and storage.  The moonroof has more wind noise that I would like.  Also, I was disappointed that the windows were not tinted. I miss the ""sound"" of the G35! Handling is excellent.  Very easy car to drive, with some fun gadgets.  Gas mileage is fair 18-20 around town.  There is not much knee room in the back, and not great cup holders, also, if you put tall cups in the shorter cup holders, reaching the gear shift is awkward The leather seats are quite comfortable - maybe not for larger indivduals due to the curving in of the seats.  "
infiniti,ex35,2008,waltaz, 04/04/2008,Love my new EX35!!,4,"Leased an EX35 Journey RWD Liquid Platinum/Graphite/Wood Trim with Premium, Nav, Luxe Style, Roof Rails, Cargo Area Protector and Cargo Organizer.  I simply love the vehicle.  Had purchased an '08 G35 sedan a month ago for my wife and was so impressed with it that my loaded '06 Honda Pilot EX-L V6 no longer cut it.  Looked at the Acura RDX and the EX, and the EX just blew it away on ride, comfort, noise, build quality and luxury.  I gave up a lot of room moving from the Pilot into the EX, but in reality, I am the only occupant 90+% of the time, and hardly ever use the back seats.  Sure, no more futons from IKEA in the back, but the luxury, features, ride and sportiness more compensate."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Fun Drive, 04/05/2008,I Love My Car!!!,4,"After test driving numerous cars (BMW, MB, Audi, Volvo) I fell in love with everything about this car. The design is exceptional, in and out. The ride phenomenal. And it has plenty of power. It feels great riding a car that doesn't fit the mold of typical crossovers. Everybody does a double take when I drive by. I love it!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,Jonathan P., 04/25/2008,My wife is still smilin',4,"I surprised my wife with a Tidewater EX35 AWD Journey for our 25th anniversary. This crossover is wonderful. The seats are the most comfortable that I have ever experienced. I drive a Mini Cooper S daily, so the the ""fun to drive"" value of the EX35 doesn't quite match up for me but it is still an enjoyable driving experience. The gadgets are awesome. After test driving the suv/crossovers from BMW, Nissan, Lexus, and Ford, it was an easy choice to go with the Infiniti. For me the best part is having my wife feel like she's driving her ""perfect car"". After 2 months she still smiles when she gets in the drivers seat. Gas mileage is 18-20 mpg. "
infiniti,ex35,2008,cartech, 04/29/2008,"Tech heaven, or tech hell?",4,"On paper, this is a car from heaven for tech geeks:  hard-drive rips and stores your CDs, flash card reader for music, voice activated phone and navigation, intelligent cruise control, lane-departure warning and prevention, 4-cam virtual overhead parking image, etc.  Imagine having all that in your new car and then not being able to use it!  Infiniti's legal department has *really* gone overboard in limiting what you can do with your tech if you are not stopped.  Example:  want to find a restaurant?  you can only choose from the four nearest, even if 3 are behind you.  Even the music system is restricted when you're driving.  Insane.  Really, really frustrating."
infiniti,ex35,2008,I LOVE MY EX!!!, 05/05/2008,I'm loving it!,5,"I really think that Infiniti went over the edge when making the EX. I fell in love with this vehicle from the time I got into it. I had an option to either go with the BMW X5 or the Lexus RX 330 and hands down the Infiniti won. The ride is smoother and quieter as well. For me it worked out great. I'm single no kids, and love to travel. I had a fully loaded HHR, and had to trade it in after looking at this vehicle. All I have to say is keep up the good work Infiniti!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,LNR, 05/09/2008,Extraordinary? Yet TBD.,4,"I really like this little car.  It drives like an Audi but is more comfortable for my tall friends and family.  I am very irritated by the ""fuel pump"" quandary which is detailed below."
infiniti,ex35,2008,FANTASTIC VEHICLE!, 05/12/2008,Fantastic vehicle!,4,"Love my EX AWD Journey w/all available packages.  More comfort and convenience, and much better appearance, than X3 or MDX, better ride than FX.  Exceptional comfort, performance, and sound system enable me to arrive at work, or at destination on business trip, energetic and not tired as was the case before having my EX.  Limited rear seat leg room makes this more suited for 1-2 people; adults and tall teens will probably find rear seats too confining except around town."
infiniti,ex35,2008,Nick S., 05/15/2008,Great car but a few shortcomings,4,"My wife and I bought this car yesterday after doing a lot of research on the internet and shopping around for weeks. We have the AWD Journey model with premium and nav packages.  The biggest surprise for me is how small a change in handling and aggressiveness it was from our 4-cylinder Camry.  The EX does not feel aggressive at all, and the small turn radius keeps it from feeling like an unwieldy SUV.  Supposedly it goes from 0-60 in 6.3 seconds, and the acceleration is there when you need it, but you wouldn't expect this if you aren't pushing it hard (unlike the BMW 1-series, which even at 10 mph lets you know it is ready to rocket you into space at any moment).  But, we love how it drives!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,Humpdiesel, 05/18/2008,Car With Character,4,"I bought my new Infiniti EX35 5 days ago, and I love it!! My 01 Infiniti QX4 my parents got me had to go. I am a realtor so I put a lot of miles on cars. I love to drive my car to work everyday. I just get pumped up wherever I go. I hope to put around 300,000 miles on it when I am done. Whenever I go shopping someone tells me that sure is a nice car you have!"
infiniti,ex35,2008,ZzGORDOXzZ, 03/03/2020,Great for 2 person and cargo space,4,"Recommend for 2 seater not 5 seater because the rear seats leg room is quite tight otherwise great space for 3 children to sit and the cargo space is good, It is why I give it a 4 Star.

If U R looking 4 a modern, sporty luxurious 5 door hatchback that has sports sedan handling, a powerfully superb V6, useful cargo room and which is easy to enter/exit, thanks to the slightly elevated ride height put this vehicle on your short list.   Up front it's roomy and most comfortable (dual power heated seats and dual climate controls).  Overall, our EX has proven 2 B an exceptional driving experience every day with some cool tech features thrown in.       "

This car has a great ride, great performance, and is so easy to get around in that I can say it has been the best infiniti thus far. Love the hatch back for easy access. The only improvement would be a little more leg room in the back seats. "
infiniti,ex35,2009,Darl, 06/15/2017,Good small SUV,4,"I purchased mine used with 30,000 miles in 2012. I am sometimes confused with calling it an SUV because it sits low and looks more like a hatchback. This small SUV has treated me well. It is comfortable, rides well and is comfortable. I have test drove the small BMW's, Benz and Acura. The only car that came close in price was the Acura when you compare the options. The Journey has it all. The only option that is missing is the auto fold mirrors and the rear tail gate lift. You would think as a luxury vehicle this would have that. The back seats are also cramped. However, It is just me so this is not  huge concern. I do like the ride, power and the interior looks and features.
"
infiniti,ex35,2009,Dustin, 09/09/2009,"Nice, But.",4,"I've been driving this for a month as a loaner from dealer. Car is a blast to drive.  Power is unbelievable and transmission is silky smooth.  Wife didn't realize once she was going 100mph. Everyone LOVES the backup cam. Interior isn't huge.  Seems equivalent of a Camry. Blind spots are annoying. You have to really turn your head to be sure. Using this car for a road trip with spouse and 3 kids may work, but you will use roof for luggage."

We were looking to replace a small sedan with a small crossover, something to easily drive and park in San Francisco.  We wanted a top safety pick.  There are not many cars that have the manufacturer option of both front and rear parking sensors. We found them especially helpful in our minivan. We also wanted HID lights, a small turning radius, and easy access to the rear seats for placing children in car seats.  "
infiniti,ex35,2009,Mujtaba, 09/05/2009,Poor Quality,2,"I have bought Infiniti EX35 in June 2008, since then I have not been happy with the car, the brakes starts creaking 5 days after each service, paid for brake pads a couple of times on recommendations. Still not closure to this problem, apart from this the outer side-view mirrors creak each time i put the car into reverse, the sun-roof vibrates continuously. With the money spent and the so called reliability of the car portrayed has left me in dismay. I think Infiniti could do a better job. Really disappointed."
infiniti,ex35,2009,LW, 07/06/2009,Newly purchased,4,"The vehicle is very responsive and fun to drive. Drives like a sports car, with very good ride quality.

We really wanted a small vehicle with comfort, we wanted a sharp Interior, a good ride and performance. The EX was the only car that fit the bill. I am 6 foot tall and the EX fit me well. We are empty nesters, the back seat was not a real concern. We were happy the the service from the Infiniti Dealer and the price received. We purchased the 360 monitor system, my wife really likes the way it helps her park. "
infiniti,ex35,2009,cravatts, 08/28/2009,"A good drive, lower quality build",4,"Prior to this vehicle, I owned an FX35 for two years.  I wanted the same performance in a tighter package...which is primarily what I got in the EX35.  However, the build material and quality do not seem as good as the FX model - thus, the price difference.  Decent fuel efficiency, fast drive and decent power, this little car has a punch.  Small interior space in back seats, no power jack in the back area (bad if you have IPOD or phone users back there!) cheap visors that break regularly, and seals on the doors that come off...some of my 2 cents on the inferior issues.  Also, scratches and marks VERY easily, inside and out.  If you have long nails, or move a lot of items around, careful!"
infiniti,ex35,2009,CG62, 08/25/2009,Perfect fit,5,"I needed to lease a small luxury SUV. Test drove EX35, FX35, ML350, Q5.  I have owned in the past X5 and FX35.  BMW X5 was too expensive to consider this time.  My kids are grown so I wanted something small and fun to drive with decent mileage and luxury for a reasonable price. The EX won easily. The EX needs to be driven to be appreciated.  Very fast, handles great, good ride.  The space is fine for my needs.  Front seat comfort is excellent.  So far avg. 20.5 mpg in mixed driving.  Rear seat comfort is OK, better than reported. The lease deals are so much better than anything else in this class."
infiniti,ex35,2009,Bob, Tupelo MS,"This is ""The 4 Door Sports Car"" !!",4,"If you're looking for a car that is fast, has great handling, is smooth riding, comfortable and super quiet - This is the car for you! After 6 months I still can't wait to hop in it each morning to head for work. I have owned 35 cars and this is as much fun as a sports car without the punishing ride and all of the other drawbacks.  It also looks great and has plenty of room to haul things with the rear seats down. Yes the back seat is small but I'm an empty nester and the front seats are great. It's also exclusive. You won't see yourself coming and going like in an Lexus RX 350. If you don't have to haul around a bunch if kids; treat yourself and put an EX 35 in your garage."

infiniti,ex35,2010,ronkent, 05/13/2014,What a solid well balanced machine,4,"I had been
looking for the smallest most luxurious SUV on the market and sort of stumbled upon the EX35.
 Bought a 2010 from CarMax in Jan. 2014 and have enjoyed it so much.
I truly cannot even imagine driving a more refined, comfortable, practical (I have no kids), good looking, quick vehicle.
Adding a new set of Michelin all season performance tires helped a lot.   I like everything about this car and have no complaints other that the so so gas mileage.
 I plan to own this for a long time.  as of November 2016 i am still very pleased.  and Modern Infiniti does a great job.  Update 11-2017.   just drove the newest little SUV from Infiniti while my car was being serviced.  It did show me that the EX35,  while a great car,  is very clunky by comparison.   But i still like the EX35 a lot and would recommend it without hesitation.

Fun to drive, classy interior, tight fit & finish, cozy cabin, retro clock, warm leather, wood accents, the works!
Was surprised that the XM nav, weather & traffic require separate purchases after 3 months.
Mileage isn't what they promise or other reviews mention.
Had one problem within a week of purchase with a rear ""clunk"" when going over a bump which Infiniti immediately repaired.
Storage is fine for short trips or 2 passengers.
I would recommend the car to anyone.
Bubye Audi!"
infiniti,ex35,2010,onionring1, 01/17/2011,Love this car!,5,"I decided to wait one full year from purchase to give an accurate review of this car.
On every level this car has been an absolute joy to drive!
Beautiful interior and exterior design, rock solid construction, outstanding performance and handling.
After 13k miles, not one problem to report.
This is such a well engineered vehicle, I love riding in this car!
Riding on snow was effortless thanks to the auto AWD.
The all around view monitor is a great feature that is extremely useful when in reverse.
When it comes to designing useful features, as well as interior and exterior styling, the engineers at Infiniti are in a class by themselves."

Great deals going on right now has everything but the Tech pkg.  My third AWD vehicle...almost 300 hp and great highway mileage 23-24, can't wait until 20,000 miles and engine broken in.  Interior and sound system rocks.  Great quality and best designed cockpit in the fleet of Infiniti's. 4 cameras feed the backup camera for an unreal view."

Flexible, comfortable, capable, best interior of all small SUV's.  At ease on the commute / fancy night out and on rutted dirt roads, snow, etc. Rear wheel drive bias is a plus.  Don't let the reported small storage behind the rear seats scare you off.  When I thought about what I truly needed the car for and how often I needed a giant box to haul things in, I realized I didn't need the box more than a few times a year.  The storage space is surprisingly good, the car is a blast to drive, and the navigation and sound systems are top of the line.  Huge incentives make this car extremely competitively priced."
infiniti,ex35,2010,ihateteeth, 12/09/2012,Update to previous review,4,"My previous review, entitled ""hugely flawed"" now need updating. My wife's EX went in for a service and for attention to the gearbox. She had mentioned the problem to the service department on two occasions and was fobbed off with ""it's the car, it's normal"", a somewhat typical reaction to females in an automotive environment. This time the service representative I dealt with was more positive. ""Sounds like it needs the software upgrade"". That is what was done and, guess what... tons more response. It now feels like her 2008 EX. Quick and ultra-responsive with no silly down changes. It's a shame the dealer didn't offer this first time round; perhaps it wasn't available.
Very happy."
infiniti,ex35,2010,The Law, 12/28/2009,This car is AWESOME!,4,"Just picked up a brand new 2010 EX35 AWD with Journey package, bluetooth, navigation and back- up camera. What can I say? This car is excellent to drive and is so much fun. Completely blows away my LR2. I only paid $34,000 which is $7,000 less than MRSP and about $4,000 less than invoice. The dealer really wanted to get rid of some stock so I got the deal of a lifetime. The gadgets are brilliant and very user friendly. Build quality is superior to other manufacturers.  Go out and buy this car if it is on your radar!!!  "

I drove an explorer for 6 years and was reluctant to buy a car after getting used to the high profile, however, the transition to the ex was smoother than I thought with all the bells and whistles, handling, and power behind it's v6 engine.  Quick acceleration, smooth ride, and takes corners like it's on rails!  Trunk space is tight, but with one of the seats down:it fits a 26"" bike with no problem and still seats the back passenger comfortably.  Great convenience features: intelligent key, navi, around view monitor, Bose. Classy styling inside and out: stands out from the pack."

infiniti,ex35,2010,Lucy, 06/12/2010,Point & Shoot,4,"Exceptional value with blistering performance.  Even without the deal we squeezed out on this car it's still preferred over the X-3 and GLK.  Feels like it's carved out of solid steel.  Bose tunes will drown out the hip hoppers at the stop light.  Handles the road without visible effort, just point and shoot and it goes where you tell it.  I'm sure the 2011 model will roll in soon with the 3.7 liter and 7 speed transmission from the G but the current configuration is way more than you'll ever need so we pulled the triggr on this one.  Gorgeous Dark Currant with Wheat and wheel package.  Around view camera is the killer ap.  Paid $36.6K vs $42.8 invoice.   Can't wait for the next road trip."

4WD system is horribly intrusive I find myself turning off VCD if there is any snow at all.
And to do that you have to hunt below your knees on the lower dash.
The snow switch I swear is nothing more than decoration.
 Has to be the slowest shifting transmission since GM's 2 speed slush box.
Comfort wise it is ok, engine is powerful but gets no where near the suggested MPG even if you were to drive downhill with a tailwind.
For the price I expected more and am really sorry I ever leased the thing. "
infiniti,ex35,2010,Smith, 11/01/2010,Giving Back,4,"After spending diligence researching all the competitors within edmunds: Q5, X3, GLK, RDX, etc and driving ALL of them; as expected, each had their +/- and all hovered in the basic model around $35K.  When you start adding options such as Bluetooth (standard in the GLK) and navigation the price differentials started to show significantly. The packages all contained features that you may or may not want however to get X you had to buy Y. IMO, the Q5 and EX35 drove the best. The ease of buttons and intuitiveness of the layout combined with multiple features leaned towards the EX.Couldn't pass on the price with every option- 43K MSRP got it for 35K. Not a chance at that price with the big boys."

The car is very comfortable but snug, and the ride is a little on the rough side (like a sports car). Entering the back seats is a little tight.

Every time I think I might be pushing too much, the EX reminds me to just keep the gas on and steer.  Interior-wise, It does get a little tight but that might be from owning 3 Jeep Grand Cherokees before and now wanting something different.  Performance wise it just moves and handles like its on rails. I can only imagine how a G37 coupe handles.  If it fits your needs and price range, give the EX a good look. You will not be disappointed."

That said an impressive vehicle-AWD confidently blasted  through 300 miles of driving rain/wet roads, integration of superior technologies top notch, fit and finish superb, interior one of the best regardless of vehicle, exterior look is aggressive and subjective to your taste, driving dynamics-handling and acceleration exceptional-ride on firm side but comfortable.

I am a short person. I love that I don't feel ""lost"" in this. The steering wheel is small/sporty. The seats are fantastic. I've got a bad back and these are great and fit like a glove. Much smoother riding than my 2006 Audi A4 (which went bye-bye). I did not want the typical SUV (been there, done that). This looks like the same height as my previous vehicle, but once inside you have a much more commanding view of the road and yet, don't feel like you will tip over. LOVE IT!"

Altho it is lite on interior space for storage and cargo, the aesthetics couldn't be better. This is my 3rd Infiniti and these just seem to be hallmarks of the brand. Cornering is very smooth and power is great. Fit and finish are wonderful, altho there is a very slight wind noise on the driver side. I purchased the AWD with Navi/Bose pkg which includes the Around View Monitor-this is an awesome feature that simplifies any kind of parking. I was disappointed to find that tonneau cover, homelink and tail gate opener near driver seat were not standard features on a car that retails for over 40K, but still very satisfied with my purchase.

It was a truly excellent car, particularly its responsiveness. Due to our financial situation she had problems trying to move to a different manufacturer. She was pre-approved for finance by Infiniti so another EX35 was a logical step. We both loved the original car anyway.
Having just read reviews of the FX35, I didn't realize why her new car was so poor. Put your foot down to enter the interstate and nothing happens, absolutely nothing. I thought maybe she just had a substandard car but now I see all these issues regarding the new transmission and Infiniti are not interested. Never again."
infiniti,fx,2011,zjk, 07/20/2011,"Fun to drive, but...",4,"Performance, comfort, reliability, design - all great.
However, it is the luxury items that disappoint.
First, the cooled seats are very hit or miss.
Some days I can really feel the cooling, other days, in only a dri-fit shirt and shorts - can't feel a thing.
The navigation - while it looks great, Infiniti has done a poor job in translating the data into the GPS system.
I have had many addresses, some in major towns, others in minor, not show up.
And what good is a GPS system when you already know where you are going?
Finally, the Bluetooth is average, at best.
I constantly get comments from people that they can barely hear or understand me.

Handling is a bit stiff, but youde expect that from a true ""Sport"" Utility. This car is big and Its heavy but youll never feel it from behind the wheel. The Tech Package is a great investment if you live in a cramped city with tight spots and double parkers. The performance, handling, and comfort is simply  a pleasure.

The seats are extremely comfortable, the ride is great, it is very quiet, but a couple things bother me.
Compared to my 2007 Acura MDX (my other vehicle) the voice recognition system is clumsy, especially when it comes to making phone calls.
The other thing that bothers me, and this may be petty, is that the center arm rest is too short.
I always drive with my left arm on the arm rest.
With the arm rest being a bit short or too far back, my elbow rests wrong and it is a bit uncomfortable.
Other than that that, I really like the truck."

Our first was a 2008 and we loved it!
Fast, comfortable great handling and sounded great. The lease ran out so we got a 2012. Mistake.
Infinity replaced the 5 speed transmission with a cheap 7 speed transmission. It robs power, is confused, shifts up and down at random and delays during quick acceleration (like when you need to pass a car). The manual function is very dangerous. When down shifting, the transmission disengages and the car free-falls for a full second until the transmission re-engages. Also, after 6 months there will be a foul smell from the AC upon start up. The dealer will recommend turning off the AC for a few secs every time you park. Really?"

I think this car is good for someone who doesn't always have people in the car or need a lot of cargo room. The backseat space and trunk is descent but not great but it works perfectly for me.

The FX37 AWD drives and handles beautifully. Really nice power when you want it with quick steering response. It's a sports ride so don't think you will get a floating ride. It's a little stiff on the street but on the open road at highway speeds it's an enjoyable ride. Storage is good for a couple of people going on a trip but if you have a family look else where. I'm 6' 1"" and the front seats are no problem. The rear seats recline and that makes them comfortable for me but straight up they are a little tight."

Unfortunately this is not really a luxury car from comfort and noise perspective: ride is very bumpy, every little imperfection makes this car bounce up-down, as if suspension had no damping ability at all. Road noise level is also on extreme side, I sometimes think my windows are open but they aren't.
Another issue is - no parking sensors in the middle of the car, so if something is exactly at the center you will not get any warnings, and if you video cams are out after a heavy rain (they are covered with water so useless) it's a real safety issue."

The only other vehicle that I thought was on the same driving experience level was the Porsche Macan GTS/Turbo and Jaguar F-Pace R, but was 80K new / 50K used.    Owning other Infiniti vehicles, I can tell you that reliability was and has never been a concern or issue.  I never have to worry if my car is going to start or when I might have to go spend thousands on repairs or service.  Change the oil and feed it gas, that's it.  I get lots of looks and compliments and couldn't be happier.

infiniti,fx,2013,David Wenzel, 05/11/2018,Poor paint,3,"I’ve owned for 3+ years. I have 67,000 miles on the car. The paint on the grill is bubbling and the artificial chrome is wrinkling. I’ve sold automotive paint all my life. This only occurs if the product painted does not have a clean surface. Infiniti will not do anything about the problem.

infiniti,fx35,2003,vivek, 05/22/2006,Think before you buy,3,"My FX35 has more rattles than any vehicle I have owned (which include Acura, Audi, Volvo, Honda etc). Every week there is something annoying - rattle of the week. Problems with driver seat which the dealer can't fix. Problem with alignment of the headlight which dealer can't fix. Busted stereo and CD player. Problem with rear-seat belt. When I take the car through a carwash, water leaks in.  The paint on this vehicle is paper thin - slightest nick and it chips off and rusts in less than few weeks. The vehicle is a pain to maintain. Repeated brake problems. Very stiff ride. The build and mechanical quality is bad enough that this will be my last Infinity. And city fuel economy of 16mp!!"
infiniti,fx35,2003,boyracer3, 01/09/2011,"130,000 miles near flawless!",4,"Bought CPO in 08 w 40K mi. I have always averaged 35-45K/yr. Usually switch cars every 6 mos-2 yrs.
Have had difficulty finding cause with this car. Squeaking brakes have been a constant issue. My cd changer skips when it's cold $500 for rebuild and xm loses signal when it's hot. 
Those are the only problems I have had.
Period. I've owned ford gm toy niss Honda Audi BMW vw & Porsche, the FX has been the most pleasant overall.
Performance & handing are great.
Service beats all others. Nav is better than 07 Audi or BMW. Also ave mixed 21 mpg and 25+ at 80mph. "

Infiniti FX. The Murano is front-wheel 
drive with significant torque steer, a 
tranversely mounted engine, and a CVT. 
The FX Std is rear-wheel drive with a 
longitudinally mounted engine, and 
automatic with auxillary 5-gear 
manual. The CVT was  smooth but the 
FX's automatic was too. The Murano 
provides manual Sport and Low gears 
and the FX has a 5-gear manual. The FX 
handles like a sports car while the 
Murano wallows on curves. Inside, the 
FX dash is cleaner than the confusing 
array in the Murano. "
infiniti,fx35,2003,hasai, 12/29/2010,Buy it used,4,"I never dreamed I would be driving this type of vehicle but have come away impressed with most everything about it.
Never like the looks but have grown to appreciate it...I don't ever get tired of looking at it.
What's impressive is how well it's put together and how smooth it is.
The driveline is unbelievable and the sound of the engine is simply awesome.
The suspension soaks up the bumps nicely and you always feel in control.
It handles like it's on rails and cannot be appreciated until you get into another vehicle.

It's for people that want sports car like handling without the penalty.
Has plenty of room but limited height due to it's shape.
Overall, a great vehicle!"
infiniti,fx35,2003,John, 07/11/2009,No regrets,4,"Purchased used Sport edition with 26K miles and have overall been very satisfied at 53K.  More or less a full-size wagon, it is fun to drive with decent cargo space.  Was a little concerned since 2003 was first model year, but only issue has been one fuse replacement that was not really expensive to address.  CD player has become jammed, but mostly use ipod and satellite radio.  Have only used regular fuel, but acceleration has been solid.  Although now seven years old, exterior styling is timeless (which I think is better than 09 body style change).  Would definitely recommend to anyone dealing with dual child seats and does not want or need huge SUV or minivan.  "

In all, great car, great looks, great performance, so-so gas mileage of 16/20. I love driving it, except when my bladder's full, due to the violent ride characteristics.

Search online for ""2003 FX35 overheating"" and you will find many of us who needed new blocks or engines at $6 to $8k. this is not what I expected from a ""reliable"" car company like Nissan.

And you are safe in this car, my Mother has used it for mountain/snowy trips, she fell in love with it.  This would be the  safest- fastest car for your loved ones.

It has always been a head turner, and is so comfortable, safe, and fun to drive that I can justify the poor gas mileage and skimpy cargo space.  I have gotten a roof cargo carrier for trips.  The 2008 has some great new features, backup camera, keyless entry, bluetooth.  It handles great in bad weather, is solid as a rock(I have never hydroplaned) and my bad back never hurts, even on long trips because of the extremely comfortable and heated seats!

Coming out of a Porsche Boxster, the 
last thing I wanted was to get in to a 
slow, gas guzzling SUV that with one 
swerve of the wheel could end up on 
it's roof instead of it's wheels. It 
handles as well as if not better than 
my Porshe. 0 to 60 in 6.3 seconds. WOW
Every amenity you could ask for. Tons 
of room. Add to that the same gauk 
factor that I had in the Boxster. 
The only SUV's I considered were the 
BMW X5 and the Mecedes Benz M55, after 
driving the FX I had forgotten that 
both the BMW and the Mercedes exist;

The DVD player is great for my granchildren (especially with the headphones).  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.

infiniti,fx35,2003,kmingis, 08/18/2003,German fee; Japanese quality,5,"Not only does my FX handle and feel like an 
Audi (until now, my benchmark for quality), but 
it is a stylish vehicle obviously built to last. I've 
put more than 2,000 miles on it in less than 
two weeks (including a 1-drive from RI to NC), 
and have never enjoyed a car more. The interior 
is amazingly comfortable, easy on the eyes, and 
the handling is unbelievable. It stuns me that a 
car that looks this big feels like an A4 on the 
road. People stare as I go by on the highway, 
wondering what an FX is. And the v-6 growl is 
great."
infiniti,fx35,2003,Tmakedon, 08/20/2003,FX35 purchased over FX45,4,"I went to the dealership thinking of 
the FX45, I usually go for the bigger 
engines when I buy a  car. When I 
drove both I found the V8 a bit 
smoother but not really enough ooomph 
to spend the extra money. It seems 
like this vehicle was designed to be 
fitted with the 3.5 liter, handles 
great, is nimble for a vehicle that 
size. Anyhow this car is definitely a 
winner and can handle anything a city 
has to offer, traded in my BMW 330 and 
have never been happier!"

making up reasons to go places just to 
drive it-if it was a women I'd think I 
was in love.I was looking to buy a G35 
sport coupe and test drove the FX on a 
whim.Those ponies got up and went 
really fast and the exhaust note 
sounded like a hotrod...I mean big fun 
to drive.Next,even when I test drove 
the G35 I found myself still thinking 
about the excitement I felt pushing the 
FX with that immediate pick-up and 
exhaust roar...a great thrill plus a 
real looker in Blk with the chrome

best ever. "

versitile, functional, and with a 
healthy dose of that ""fun to drive""

and styling to die for inside and out. 
I have the black on graphite scheme,

road today! The power and handling of 
this vehicle are almost flawless! 
Nissan/Infiniti really did their 
homework by sharing the FM platform

However, the road handling especally on 
the parkway has disappointed me. The 
car hydo planes when you hit a sewer or 
bumb at speeds over 50. I was told it's 
the AWD kicking in,  

Effortless in changing lanes, and

easy and again effortless."

came down to this and the X5.  I am so 
glad I chose this.  Parked next to an

No more locking keys in the car or 
backing into things now with the

go with the FX35 because it had more

I did. It is an awesome car! I am 
still getting used to the brief engine

it. "

not well in busy areas. On a 3000 mile 
trip to florida, I only had two minor 
problems. One was the cruise control 
had too many bugs on it and

Love the feeling of driving it with the 
stereo cranked and on New England back 
roads.  Ride is not 'couch smooth', but 
I didn't buy it for that -- it handles 
so well!!
The only complaint I have is that there 
should be a bumper guard on top of the 
rear bumper -- it gets scratched 
getting items in and out of rear hatch 
area."

three larger SUV's and the FX35 blows 
them away when it comes to handling and 
overall driving performance. It turns 
like a sports car and I can handle 
turns at 50% faster speed than my prior 
SUV's. 
I did have a problem that took the 
dealership 17 days to diagnose. Turned 
out to be a faulty circuit board that 
keeps track of odometer readings. 
Without it the car won't start. It was

Acceleration is smooth and fast.  On 
sharp corners, you'd think this was a 
sports car and not a SUV.  No hint of 
instability.  Haven't had this much fun 
taking curves since my 1979 RX7.  

Keyless entry/ignition is a blast.  
Seat/wheel/mirror position memnory is

between the door frame and the seat is 
too narrow.  Could be better.  You can 
feel almost every bump on the road.  
The navigation stops working if there 
is a EZ Pass decale on the dash.  The 
wheels are too big for the model to 
handle so the car pulls to one side or 
the other, even if there is a wheel 
alignment done.  The gas mileages got 
worse even though the same grade of

shut off the ignition. Blind spots, all

This Infiniti has not been in the shop

infiniti,fx35,2003,jmg35, 02/05/2004,The Ultimate SUV,5,"My wife and I purchased this SUV about 
two weeks ago and we love everything 
about it. We got the Tech and Touring 
packages; which bring among other 
things, the navigation system, keyless 
entry, rear-view camera & intelligent 
cruise control. All the technology is 
great, but what really puts a smile on 
our faces is the engine/exhaust growl. 
The FX is an SUV like no other. The 
fit and finish and technology 
amenities are first class for an SUV 
in this price range. This is an 
exciting machine to drive, feel and 
listen to."
infiniti,fx35,2003,DiamondFX, 02/05/2006,It excels on every count....,5,"Wow, after owning both sedans and sport utes (Grand Cherokee, Montero SR, Expedition, ML430, and Murano), I have finally found a vehicle that delivers on all counts.  I almost found it with the Murano (great looks, mpg, handling), but the CVT did not give me the performance I was looking for.  It was almost too smooth.  I picked up an AWD FX35 right after that.  My driving is a mix of daily commute, kid hauling, and weekend work.  In addition, we had a cabin in the mountains that we were decorating.  I added a hitch to the FX for bike, but it pulled a loaded trailer up gravel hills of the mountain with no issue at all.  I also installed the XM radio (love how Infiniti lets you choose)."
infiniti,fx35,2003,InfinitiLover, 02/18/2004,review,4,"I have had my FX for a year now.  Love 
everything about it, except for how it 
drives with the optional 20 inch  
wheels.  The ride is too hard for these 
big rims, and when you hit even the 
slightest pot hole it feels like you 
are going into the Grand Canyone.  
Other than that love the crossover!"

infiniti,fx35,2003,San Diegan, 03/14/2006,Love this Car,4,"I no longer have any car-envy.  I would rather drive this car than any car selling for less than $70k.  It oozes style; it has bells and whistles that I never knew existed - but now can't live without (keyless entry/ignition); it's a hoot to drive - especially in corners; and is very comfortable.  The ride is harsh, but what do you expect from the sport package?  In my opinion chrome trim looks better than more expensive wood in other cars.  The center arm rest in the 2003 model seems cheap, flimsy and out of place in such a nice car. Also, the similar Murano has more trays and cubbies for your gear.  I almost went with the Murano for that reason but stuch with the FX for the style points."

with the Technology package - 
Navigation + Intelligent Key and Smart 
Cruise Control.  Personally I think 
the navigation is a little clunky due 
to having to use a joystick as opposed 
to a touch screen.  The Keyless 
Ignition and Laser Assisted cruise 
control are very cool.  Mechanically 
the car performs amazingly.   The only 
thing is I wish it were a little 
higher/more SUV like - just for the 
driving position.  I was also a little 
hesitant on the styling - but it's 
growing on me more and more.  It's one 
of those vehicles that you will over

were well thought through by the 
designers. "

infiniti,fx35,2003,John, 07/25/2006,Love it,4,"Bought it used in 2004 and it has been a true joy since.  It is very spacious for four passengers.  Not for five.  Much sportier design than other crossovers, which seemed too much like minivans (the Mercedes) or station wagons (Ford, Audi).  Gas consumption could be better, but I am averaging 18.8 with roughly 20% highway use and 80% city use.  However, it is worth the extra power, especially with high octane gas.  On a smooth open road (highway), it is an absolute dream.  It is especially good for skiing (skis on the roof rack, passengers toasty on the inside, most comfortable ride I've taken to the mountains ever).  Bought one for my dad, too!"

In all fairness, you really cannot compare the FX and the Tahoe.  Each has it's benefits and shortfalls.  However, if you are looking for  sports car performace along with the versatility of an SUV give strong consideration to the FX.  Fit and finish are A-1, on this vehicle as well as perfomance and handling.  I am thrilled with this vehicle and enjoy it more each day.

even a Mini Cooper S, all of which were 
2003 models. No matter what, I kept coming 
back to the FX35; it just feels right; the V-6

My Infiniti got half way up his drive and then slipped all the way down backwards. (no injuries) He has a Range Rover. He came down his driveway and picked us up in his RR, went up the hill, no problem. The interior is also a bit tight. (not to much headroom) My wife claims it drives like a truck.

to put in my two cents.

I have been driving BMWs for the past 
ten years. My last car was a 500 
series with sports package.  Going 
from that to FX35, I can tell you 
honestly that I was pleasantly 
surprised at how much stable this SUV 
is given that fact that it is an SUV. 
Listen everyone, I am comparing this

I literally followed the car not just with my eyes; my whole body turned as it passed by.  It was love at first sight.  i never get this way about cars.

It surprised us that we could get great performance and handling from a vehicle of this size and still get a constant 20 mpg, on average, while cruising at 80 mph.  We're on our 3rd set of tires and have 81k mi on the car and have switched from the stock 20"" Goodyear RSAs to BFG KDWs.  An excellent choice as they handle better and hold the road better when cornering.  I find the FX35 fun to handle on winding mountain roads and use the manual mode to save the brakes.  We put new rear brakes on at 75k and will put new fronts on at 82500k. Virtually no maint other than oil changes. "

pretty much out muscle and out turn

for tough winters. Driving alone, this 
SUV is a real kick. For family trips, 
the MDX had more room and the third 
seat. The FX gives up space in the rear 
storage and back seat floor areas. 
Still getting used to the ride which is 
firmer and bouncier, even with the 18"" 
wheels.  Bad bumps can send the FX  
sideways for an instant, although it 
snaps right back. Performance is 
awesome at low speeds, but not as good  
when trying to pass on the highway. So 
it's not perfect but it's still a lot 
more fun than the MDX."

15k miles.

miles (and less than one year) I will 
have spent over $3000 on upkeep. While

BUT, buyer beware---These cars have a notorious ""rattle"" when starting the car, and it CAN'T be fixed; I know because I've spent thousands trying. This rattle is a problem with all Infiniti & Nissan vehicles that use this same motor. It makes your ride sound like total garbage. AND, the seats fall apart. They used a very poor quality piece along the edges of the seats that literally fall apart, and will cost you about $300 to fix, per seat. AND, the trim on the outside looks horrible after a few years; about $500 per door to fix ($2k total). AND the brakes have issues that can't be fixed. "

It's sporty and super capable.
My problem is with their build quality and customer service.
Infiniti used sub par material on their dashes and they bubble in the heat.
It looks terrible, like a rash on the whole dashboard.
Infiniti replaced it once 3 years ago.
It was a recall but my service rep said he was doing it as a favor (and suggested his favorite brand of whiskey, which I unwittingly bought him as thanks).
 When this same problem occurred again 3 years later Infiniti says that it's no longer under warranty even though the warranty on the dash was changed to 8 years (and this one is only 3 years old).
I can't stand to look at it now. DO NOT BUY INFINITI. "

Great power, and handling but a rough ride. Good snow handling after replacing factory tires at 17k. Poor turning radius. Exhaust noise is tiring on the ears. Poor instrument layout AND function, lots of cheap plastic and rattles, frustrating air controls. Entire dash panel ""Blistered"" badly due to defective mfg or materials... no dealer or manufacturer support for this issue. Even with close maintenance, car is falling apart mechanically. Wheel bearings failed right off the lot, complete exhaust system rotted, and front end and steering shot. Will not buy Infiniti again. Price outruns reliability. "
infiniti,fx35,2004,Patrick In Denver, 02/20/2009,Love The Look,4,"This car is great.  Handles well in the snow has a lot of get up and go.  Plus it looks cool.  I bought the car in Dec. and it had 50,000 miles on it.  Only issue I have had is that it look like I need the breaks replaced which is something that sounds common on these cars.  It is fun to drive and I am looking forward to taking it up to the mountains in the summer.  There is plenty of power and the handling feels more like a sports car then an SUV.  I have been getting about 16.5-17 MPG.  Overall I love the car.  "

If and when this car dies, then I will consider buying another one."
infiniti,fx35,2004,Joseph, 11/05/2009,Incredible Vehicle,4,"With just short of 50,000 miles on the odometer, the FX has been nothing but a thrill to own and drive.   The power from the V-6 is enough to snap your neck, the interior is gorgeous in every way and the design of the exterior is still a category leader.  Great engine, strong transmission and the AWD is amazing.  The Bose system is great and the interior layout has been well thought out.   Paint and fit are top quality.   "

money on the FX45 which was my 
original intent, the 35 w/touring and 
techno pkg is the way to go. Less 
unsprung weight w/18 vs 20"" wheels, 94

advantage. I love this animal."
infiniti,fx35,2004,Jeff, 01/06/2006,Too much noise,4,"The FX is a fun car to drive because it handles beautifully.  However, I quickly grew disappointed with the vehicle because the leather squeaks and the vehicle is not very ""tight.""  I found little rattles here and there, which grew very annoying over time.

poor at only 16 average not the 17-23 
on the sticker and the XM radio goes 
out for long periods for no reason. My 
other car does not have this XM

which is disappointing. Hopefully, it 
will improve. Two-tone willow and black 
(leather seats)interior is simple, 
modern, and attractive, especially with 
titanium accents. Seats are 
comfortable, and storage is excellent. 
Unfortunately, there is too much 
vibrating (almost rattling)inside the 
car from the console and storage 
compartments especially. The 20 inch 
wheels give the FX an awesome look. 
Doors should have reflectors and 
carpeting on the lower part to prevent 
scuffing. Overall, I am satisfied, but 
time will tell."

I changed the tires at 20,000 miles and replaced with Bridgestone Alanzas 20"".  These are much superior in traction in snow and rain.  They for sure will get more miles on them then the original.  Goodyears were worn out at 19,000 miles."

infiniti,fx35,2004,Tom, 10/12/2018,Aged like fine wine,4,"I took a chance and bought a 14 year old car with just 74,000 miles. So far it seems like a wise choice. You stand a good chance of getting a really nice car for a good price if you pick an older Japanese luxury model. They seem to hold up much better than the American and German premium brands. My FX35 looks contemporary even if tech features are archaic. It has the typical FX35 door lock issues but there are cheap fixes for that nowadays. Other than that all accessories work as they should. The performance may have been outstanding in 2004, but is middle of the road in 2018. Power from the 280HP V6 is adequate and the FX has a substantial feel to it you won’t find in a brand new Chevy Equinox. Getting 17 MPG on 89 octane in the city. Driving in wet weather conditions with awd is surefooted and it’s unaffected by crosswinds, we’ll see how it does in snow soon enough.

LOVE the chrome wheels as well as the red color (which they stop making in 2004).  Its an eyecatcher!  The only problems are the squeaker brakes and a noise when I turn the car to  left.  Gas mileage isn't the greatest either.  The seats also tend to split from the heat.  Other than that the car was awesome to own and fun to drive!  Unfortunately my lease is up and I opted to buy another SUV instead of leasing a 2009 FX.  But I have SUPER great memories and I will hate to see this car go!!!!  The only other thing I notice is the mirror paint or color tends to fad with time.

In the last year I have replaced both front bearings (luckily covered under warranty) and just got a $1000 bill to fix my front seat.  I have owned 16 cars in my life and the front seat has never broken on any of them.  The seat heaters failed (I am not repairing) and they said the seat track is broken and the part alone is $700.

is the rougher ride on city streets. I 
have the 20"" wheels and they say the 
18"" wheels rides a little smoother but 
doesn't look or handle as good.  I get

But this baby roars.  The styling is 
2nd to none (the looks I get 
everywhere).  It has a true muscular 
stance and performs the way it looks.  
I looked at Merc. and BMW and they 
were good, but this is it.  Simply 
outperforms any other crossover

infiniti,fx35,2004,Bard, 04/01/2004,Simply the Best,5,"When you have a convertible and the 
wife says that we need a new car and 
yours is just too small, Look out!

The deal was that I had to buy a car 
that had AWD for the snow, and 
somewhere to put the dog (not that we 
have one yet). It also had to be large 
enough to move the plethora of things 
from storage. Ok that's what the wife 
wanted. 

I wanted a sports car. Something that 
really let you know you were driving. 

Guess what? The only real sports car 
that fulfilled my wife's demands and 
my deisres was the Inifiniti. All the 
reviews and hype about the FX-35 were 
spot on. If you like the styling you 
will love everything else."

We recently took a trip and averaged over 24 mpg which is the best we have ever gotten. We average slightly over 20 city/highway 99% of the time. I wish we had opted for the navigation system but it was an ugodly 4,000 more. On a car costing 40K you think it would be included. And the front seats are one piece and bubble up in the center depending on the outside temps. They have since put a pleat down the middle which took care of that problem. "

as my A4 Cabrio, with a load more 
power. Handles really well!  Havn't 
driven the Chyanne, but I've got to 
believe the FX is close.  I've now 
owned an RX300, XC90 T6 and the Touareg 
and the FX blows them away.  All had 
good points, but the FX is by far the 
best combo of power, handleing and

most SUV's out there, and many cars too,

a Japanese superbike.

This 18"" wheel/tire combo has the 
perfect ride and handling tradeoff.
Acceleration is very good for its

The X3 and X5 can't come close for the

The Lexus and Acura are well, bland.

long to adjust to driving a larger size

tricky.  This car handles like a sports

Technology, and Sports Package for $45K

than two months and already put 7000 
miles on it.  There are no other cars 
within it's price/class can compare to 
FX35's power, performance, standard 
features, and handling.  I defininitely 
recommend the Technology Package. The 
rear camera and nav will come in 
handy.  I average about 17 city/19 
highway miles per gallon.  If you plan 
on taking this car on long trips (over 
2 hrs), forget it! It's a VERY 
rough/stiff ride, especially for the 
passengers in the back."

out.  People look and stare at the FX

FX35 is quick but the 45 drives a 
little better due to torque 
differences.  The sport package which 
includes 20'' gun metal wheels and 
stiffer suspension provides great 
handling - but beware - can make the 
ride stiff and bouncy - actually 
getting to the point where it can be a 
bit jarring at times.  However - if 
you enjoy driving a responsive 
vehicle - this is a welcome feel.  I 
have had the FX for 2 
months now and post break-in the

little.  Make sure you drive both the 
sport and non sport versions!  "

to the riding comfort. All 
instrument/controls easy to see through 
steering wheel and all easily 
accessable.
The interior of the FX35 appears richly 
appointed and has many easy to use 
features. I liked the fact that the 
FX35 comes in basically two models with 
few extras, meaning that finding the 
right vehicle is basically color 
selection and easily located within the 
Infinity system."

I drive daily in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area and the FX is best equipped to be agile enough to zoom through heavy traffic more like a sport car then an SUV( more like a sedan on steroids). I have the 2005 FX35S sport package including the larger rims but the car does not need any additional sport features..it breeds aggressive driving300HP .sport exhaust system. Supper cool interior (I have the light cream interior) with excellent attention to details ( M. Pop)"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Richard Beckett, 03/20/2018,Until I Die,5,"I watched, with envy, those who drove in the Infinity FX35 since 2003.  Then in August of 2005 I drove past a dealership and saw a 2005 FX35 in a pearl white metallic with a wheat colored interior and decided if I could sit in the drivers seat safely, I would become the source of other peoples envy.  I have a back problem that requires exactly the right combinations to exist while getting in, getting out and of course sitting.  It begins with the height of the seat from the ground.  FX35 perfect. Next, the seat has to power recline and must offer power adjustable  lumbar support.  FX35, perfect.  Then, the seat has to be firm.  FX35, perfect.  Finally, power tilt/telescopic searing must accommodate my need to severely recline the seat back.  FX35, perfect.  I spent an hour and a half just sitting, then getting out, then getting back in, then sitting.  after an hour, the salesman came out and asked if there was a problem, I answered ""not yet"".  Half an hour later, salesman came out again and asked if I wanted to take the car for a drive.  I said ""It's not that important"".  He went silent for a moment, then smiled and said ""Take it for a drive"".  I said ""Fine, I will"".  Half an hour later I returned.  The salesman said nothing, he just smiled knowingly as did I.  I had come to understand what an incredible vehicle this was.  Beyond it's incredible, exciting styling, there was the growl of the motor, the ride, the firm, planted to the pavement handling and that feeling of pride as I left the dealership and walked toward the car I had coveted for 2 years, with keys in my hand and the legal right to drive away.  I have replaced the battery and tires, changed the oil (synthetic) and filter as required without incident for 12 and a half years.  Head lights were replaced due to a factory recall (no cost to me).  I have the car detailed every spring for the last 8 years.  To this day, when I approach my FX35, I get the same knowing smile on my face that I shared with the salesman and when I park it and walk away, I always turn around for one more look.  When crossing paths with other FX35 owners at stoplights or in a parking lot, I again exchange that knowing smile with others who own this rare source of pride and performance.  Hard for some to understand maybe, but you either get it, or you don't.  It was my plan to drive my FX35 until Infinity offered an FX styled vehicle with full electric drive train.  To my horror, Infinity announced that 2018 would be the last year they would manufacture the FX35.  They have since announced their intention to offer an electric model by 2022 - which effectively means by 2025, 7 years from now.  I'm 75 years old so I could be [non-permissible content removed] out of luck by then (dead).  Since I only drive 3,500 miles per year, I guess I'll probably drive my FX35 ""Until I Die"".  It's currently remains irreplaceable.  I don't have navigation or Bluetooth, but I have a smart phone I can talk to and will talk back, so I'm good.  My one and only small complaint is the relatively poor gas mileage (13MPG in town - 24MPG on the hi-way), but that's a price I am eagerly willing to pay.  Damn, that car is beautiful.

The style, the performance and simplicity of regular maintenance. 
Changing the driveline is very simple. Take bolts out, fill it with the proper fluids and put bolts back in. Other than the tranny, all fluids are available anywhere.
Air filter is easy to change.
Spark plugs are harder because of all the wires and the cover, but shouldn't take longer than an hour.
BIGGEST problem of this vehicle is its valve covers (alot of them). They leak after 80K and you have to change them BOTH.

I felt this was the only SUV that gave me that feeling and still does. Quality from back to front and top to bottom. It just came down to how much quality do you want for your money.  "
infiniti,fx35,2005,LUCIE, 09/23/2009,DO NOT buy this car - bubbling dash board,3,"I have a 2005 FX35 that I paid 43k and I would not recommend any of the FX35.  Infinity dealer replaced my bubbling dash board July 2008 when my car had only 28,000 miles.  Now 14 months later at 40k miles the same problem.  Out of warranty by 2 months and Infiniti dealer is not willing to help me unless I pay $1500 to have the dash board replaced with no guaranty that this will not happen again.  The problem is the glue that was used in the dashboard is causing the problem.  You pay good money for a car and it is a big problem.  It will lower the value of my car. I do not recommend this car to anyone."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Julia, 01/15/2007,A car that thrills..,5,"I have had this car for four months now, and had an Infiniti previously as well. I am hooked! This car is thrilling to drive, super comfortable, great on gas, and although I usually could care less about driving here and there I actually look forward to driving this car every day.  It is so super responsive, it's got the agile handling of a sports coupe. It's got space to grocery get,and yet it sticks to the road like glue, and is so un- minivan like. The standard/auto switch shifter is MARVELOUS! I can nagivate tight turns with ease and without cramming on the brakes all the time.  It's got a wonderful sound system, and dvd for my son-who thinks this car is the bomb! I am loving this car! "
infiniti,fx35,2005,CTMike, 10/30/2004,Fun,4,"Had a Landrover Discovery. Would have 
liked a sports car but living in 
Connecticut needed something that could 
handle the winter.  Hard to compare it 
to the Disco b/c they are 2 different 
vehicles.  Disco was a tank that could 
handle any weather or terrain but 
lacked the pick up and go that I was 
missing.  Didnt really need all that 
utility anymore.  Havent had the FX in 
the snow YET, but it is a fun car to 
drive.  Fast, sounds cool, seats feel 
like they wrap around you and it stands 
out from the rest.  Accelerating 
through turns is great, very little if 
any leaning.  Got the sports 
performance I was missing without 
giving up the AWD.Fits 4 nice. Fun car!"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Frank, 06/15/2005,Simply the Best!,5,And unbelivable drive!!! Love the interior and the sport package make the vehicle!
infiniti,fx35,2005,DONNA, 01/20/2005,Very happy,4,"I love the fx35 it handles like a car & it's a pleasure to drive. It has just the right amount of room, not too big not too small and as i learned this past week it handles great in the snow, which is a big plus."

infiniti,fx35,2005,Safiya7, 06/24/2008,Love It!,4,"I purchased my FX35 used in 2007, I had been wanting one for a least a year but was torn between the FX35 and the VW Toureg.  Well I made the right choice I have fallen in love with this car.  Coming from a VW beetle a 4-cyl to a powerful V6 was an adjustment when it came to the extra power.  This car gives you the best of everything it rides smooth like a luxury car but has that size of an SUV.  My fiance' and I took it on a trip to Las Vegas and it did great."
infiniti,fx35,2005,sidruze, 11/01/2008,Mid life crisis car par excellance,4,I've leased this car for three plus years now and am really having a hard time with the thought of turning it in. Mine has the standard 18s because I do live down a country road. I've beefed up the power with a Stillen system. I highly recommend this for anyone serious about exploring the car's true sports potential. Not that the car is underpowed stock but wow this mod really helps let the beast out. Now with 300+ hp  it just loves to run. The beemer crowd are often shocked when this car not only hangs with them but leaves many behind. Ok so I'm a little old for an outright sports car but this one is stealth personified. 
infiniti,fx35,2005,Drillsgt833, 12/18/2008,HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE IT!,5,"What can I say. Power, good looks, fun to drive, & reliable who could ask for more? This Infiniti is an excellent vehicle. My wife couldn't stand the design at first but now drives it more than I do. Plenty of power when needed. Fuel mileage is good for an SUV I get about 15-17 in the city and 21-23 on the hwy. Ride is a bit bumpy but it is to be expected for a more sporty ride. I handle and take curves better then my 98 Q45. Compared to the Lexus RX and Acura MDX it is by far the more exciting to drive!"
infiniti,fx35,2005,soccermom, 12/22/2008,I LOVE THIS CAR,4,I was not familiar with the car and my husband wanted to buy it. I now LOVE it. I love driving it on road trips the seats hug you! I love the engine I wanted at 350z and feel like I got a bigger version. My kids even love this car! I'm thinking of trading it as my kids are going off to college and am having difficulty parting with it. I didn't think I would but like the others said the one down side is the gas it is a drinker.
infiniti,fx35,2005,Todd B, 04/12/2009,2005 Infiniti FX35 .... WOW!,4," It is simply the best looking and performing Crossover SUV for the money that I could find. I test drove everything in the price range/ model years.  Nothing American was even close. Runners up were the Porsche Cayenne (too expensive, but awesome) and the BMW X5 3.0 (underpowered and a bit rough riding)  The FX35 has great acceleration and really moves out on the freeway. Handling is amazing... feels like a sports sedan. SAFETY features, AWD and NAV system make this a real smart cruiser. Everything within arms reach inside. AND the EXTERIOR... well, everything else seems ugly now.  Biased opinion I suppose. "
infiniti,fx35,2005,fxfan, 05/05/2009,Infiniti's FX is the best out there!!,5,"Ok where to start? Adaptive cruise, lane departure warning, ikey.. The list goes on!  I felt like I stole this beauty at the price I paid. This was a former Infiniti lease, that i picked up.  It has 29k for the miles.  Its 3.5l 280hp rwd is like driving a Z car, but with soo much more room.  Sure it has Bose sound, but I enjoy the engine more! All I have to say is if you haven't driven this vehicle, you are truly missing out."
infiniti,fx35,2005,coloradocheetah, 07/24/2009,FXlove,4,"Having been a 240Z enthusiast years ago, the FX reminds me of that driving experience. The cam comes on strong at 3000rpm; third gear is the true workhorse. This is a vehicle one can drive like a church lady on Sunday, or really let it go. I've left several friends breathless when jumping on the throttle. They didn't expect such performance... especially those with the Lexus RX series vehicles. Everything about the vehicle is great. Styling, handling, build quality, comfort, intelligent cruise control, too many other things to identify. I've had SUV's, BMW's, probably more than 30 different vehicles. Hands down, the Z car and the FX have been my two favorite vehicles! "
infiniti,fx35,2005,gardanzo, 04/28/2010,"120,000 miles and still smiling",4,"Enchanted in the showroom, for some reason I can't explain I was not happy with this car for the first 40K miles. The original Goodyear tires were terrible, but otherwise, the car was fine. I just didn't bond emotionally with the car.  Then I replaced the Goodyear's with Toyo's, and I began to love it. A few months ago I was in an accident, the other car ran a red light and hit the front fender. No one was hurt, and $9K later it was repaired, better than before. All the road chip damage from lots of freeway driving is now gone, replaced by a new bumper and grill, and the entire front-end repainted.  I kind of wish something would wear out so I could rationalize buying a new Infiniti."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Elusive, 07/15/2010,Fine Quality,4,I have had my AWD FX35 for one year now and have had no problems whatsoever with it. I did replace the tires with what were on it from Kumho to Goodyear Fortera which I am very pleased with providing a stable ride on wet and dry pavement. It has tons of storage in the liftback. I love all the bells and whistles. I would highly recommend this car.
infiniti,fx35,2005,Dave Glen, 01/06/2005,Cool cat,5,"This car was called the ""Bionic Cheetah"" by some car magazines, that must be due to the purrrr that comes out of the engine as you drive. I had always owned large american luxury models prior to the FX35 (full size Lincolns & Cadillacs) and the FX35 rivals those old standards in comfort, style and overall driving pleasure. It turns heads and gets a lot of thumbs up on the road, and is for sure one of the most stylish set of wheels that can be bought on the mass market. The navigation system is supreme, the sound system stellar and the front seats well just are too comfortable for words.  Get this car.......you'll absolutely love it to pieces!!!!!!!"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Rupert Evans, 01/14/2005,It performs,4,"I have been impressed with this vehicle from day one.  I recently drove from Chicago to Gainsville FL and got caught in one of the worst snow storms of the year.  My FX cut through snow and ice like it was not there.  I never swirved, slid or got stuck even on unplowed roads.  It could be better on gas, I averaged 18.5 mpg."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Rick Debenham, 01/30/2005,Sport Sedan,4,Handles well in all road conditions. Great looking vehicle - basically a sharp station wagon with some nice performance and it is loaded with luxury appointments.
infiniti,fx35,2005,M Downing, 01/30/2005,My 2003 FX35,4,"Have had 4 Mercedes and the FX compares favorably in handling and so far reliability.  Very pleased with the whole car.  Would advise purchasing the 18 inch wheels rather than 20 inch.  The ride with 20"" wheels is rather rough."
infiniti,fx35,2005,DaveD, 01/31/2005,Love my FX35 2005,4,"Although the 20"" sport rim wheels are sexy, the 18"" wheels are far more practical and have a smoother ride. I do not recommend the sport package...waste of money...sporty enough with the non-sport configuration. Tech package is a must...rear camera is GREAT! Stereo system is wonderful. Satellite radio works well but, despite advertising ""100% Commercial Free Radio"" by XM Satellite Radio, There ARE commercials (how do the sat radio companies get by with this lie?!)"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Pasquale Ergastolo, 01/31/2005,What a car for the money,5,"The FX35 is all about performane & style.  When I started shopping for a new truck, I looked at the competitors in the same range mainly the lexus & acura trucks.  The style of the FX initially won me over.  Taking a closer look into the options included on the FX for the price,  as well as the power the FX puts out, it was a slam dunk for me.  Now that I have been driving my fx for a few weeks I couldn't be happier,  the car screams out of the gate and handles like a fine sports car.  I have had encountered a couple snow storms and the all wheel drive handles better than my past 2 SUV's.  I was initially interested in a used FX, but the resale is so high it made more sense to buy a new one."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Jerry, 01/31/2005,"Fun ""Sport "" vehicle",4,"The performance and handling is pleasant change from my previous SUVs. This is truly a ""sport vehicle"" disquised as an SUV. The sound of the exhaust is very pleasing and I look forward to driving the car daily."
infiniti,fx35,2005,David, 02/13/2005,FX rocks,4,"This is the car for the car enthusiast in all of us.. The design is spectacular and all heads will turn when you drive by.   The performance is amazing for a V6; fuel economy is adequate. The snow driving handling is a bit suspect; will slip and slide, but careful driving will eliminate problems.  Stiff suspension will be a detriment to some; however, I consider it one of the FX's best features."
infiniti,fx35,2005,FRANK MONTEROSSO, 02/26/2005,Infiniti fx35 crossover,4,The fx35 is a pleasure to drive and the quality and finish is excellent..The interior is designed with the driver in mind...I would recommend this crossover  to everyone
infiniti,fx35,2005,njderby, 04/01/2005,Fun and beautiful SUV,4,"Have had our FX35 for 2 months.  Always liked the looks and as soon as I took a test drive, had to have one.  Great acceleration, powerful exhaust note, handles like a sports car.  Well equipped even if you don't load up on the tech and sport packages.  Didn't want the 20"" wheels anyway--rides just fine with the 18s.  Very roomy and comfortable front seats.  I'm 6'4"" and don't drive with seat all the way back-- first car I have ever owned to be able to say that.  Great Bose sound system.  New color Sapphire Blue you can get this year on lesser equipped models is very classy.  "
infiniti,fx35,2005,Mike, 04/12/2005,Awesome Car,4,"Great Styling.  Only drawback with my 2004 model is that my sunroof squeeks quite a bit.  I'm due for 5,000 mile service so hopefully the dealer can repair the sunroof. Otherwise, car is a headturner.  Drives nice and handles well.  Needs a standard cargo area cover and option of an even higher quality Bose System."
infiniti,fx35,2005,jkc, 04/14/2005,i love my car!!!!,4,i absolutely love my infiniti fx35!!!  I've had it for almost 2 yrs now and the only things I wish are that the passenger seat had controls to raise/lower and that the seat controls were not on top of the seat itself!
infiniti,fx35,2005,Shawn Martin, 04/29/2005,Great car,4,"I enjoy this car... handles well in the dry (and great in the snow... I was amazed with the traction during a severe snow storm).  Its fast, but not like my G35 which slams you back in your seat.  Size is right, looks are great.  Sound system is also very nice.  Seats are comfortable.  No problems at all in first 7 months.  I'm only getting 16.4 overall MPG but I have a heavy right foot."
infiniti,fx35,2005,djmull, 05/05/2005,I wish it were mine.,4,"When I was 22, I bought my first car. It was a 1987 Ford Mustang GT. I tricked it out with extra H.P. and handling accessories. I thought I was the coolest guy around. Then we bought a 2004 FX35, to replace my wife's car. I wish it were mine. Not only does it equal the 'stangs performance, it is so much more refined, it makes the GT look silly. I can't say enough. I try to run out of milk so I can take those evening jaunts to the store. The 2.5 mile ride usually takes 20 minutes, and there are no stop signs! Someday I'll get my own. Peace."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Speedy G, 05/14/2005,Vrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrroooom,4,"I figured I would be turned off by a ""Crossover"" vehicle once I took it for a test drive because of the ride comfort.  Boy, was I wrong.  The non- sport package has some bumpiness, but nowhere near what I imagined.  I went in looking at the G35, but left driving the FX35 AWD.  This vehicle is very fun to drive and handles quite well.  I drove it home from the dealer in a snow storm and I was at ease within minutes.  The 4WD grips the road during bad weather conditions effortlessly when the ""SNOW"" button is engaged.  I never drove a car in the snow feeling so secure.  Now that the weather has cleared up, the RWD is in full force and engine torque remains at high speeds.  Overall, a real winner"

infiniti,fx35,2005,bandl142, 06/02/2005,A Fun Drive,4,"With the Sport option with 20"" wheels, the ride is very hard-especially if driven in on urban roads. If not, then the performance and handling are great. It's like driving a sports car! The main problem is with the limited sight vision on the sides and the rear."
infiniti,fx35,2005,RLE, 06/10/2005,The Best Sportwagon,4,"After a year in an unreliable German piece of overrated junk, I am satisfied.  The engine is thrashy and unrefined when floored, but otherwise pulls like a torquey electric motor. The ride is as bouncy as my old sports car, but not as flat-handling. All features are a compromise, (not a sports car; not a minivan) but it's the best sportwagon out there."
infiniti,fx35,2005,sasso27, 06/12/2005,i cant stop driving it,4,"i just got my fx two weeks ago,i said i would not drive it to work everyday to keep the mileage down. YEA RIGHT that did not work its just to cool not to drive all the time. it handles like a sports car , but alot more comfortable and you gotta love the exhaust note it purrs even in idle. even the backseat is real comfortable and it reclines. my only gripe is where they put the widow controls u gotta be a contortionist to mess with the windows while youre driving."

infiniti,fx35,2005,Van, 06/15/2005,What is it?,5,"The unique style of this SUV caught my eye, but after only seconds behind the wheel I knew that I would own it. It handles like a sports car with the power and quickness of a predator. My Laser Red FX35 has the beautiful, and hugely impressive 20 inch chrome 8 spoke wheels. The wide, low agressive stance gives it that ""ready for the race track"" appearance. The automatic transmission is set like a jeweled time piece allowing the 280 horses to reach their desired rpm before smoothly but energetically grabbing the next gear, making each shift feel like I was doing it all manually. I am often ask ""what is it?"" Its BOLD, its AUDACIOUS, its SEXY! And no one will ever mistake it for a Lexus!       "
infiniti,fx35,2005,tidal, 06/25/2005,very pleased,5,"this is my second fx, I think it is a suv that handles like a sport sedan and is fun to drive, hands down the best suv for those who like performance, style and reliability. great mileage too for a suv. this is my second one. infinity would make a huge mistake to change styling on this car. a vehicle definitely ahead of its time..."

infiniti,fx35,2005,Dee, 06/30/2005,Infinity FX35,5,"Fun to drive. Attention getter.  Good gas milege, while providing a good solution for carlike/sporty ride combined with the additional height off the road and comforts of an SUV.  Fabulous car for a young professional that wants to drive something fun, without having to compromise space.  It's also easier to use to pickup your boss and important visitors, than attempting to stuff them into a 2- seater.  A great mix of form and function."

No need to get the AWD if you live in S. Florida like me, the car has enough active safety options to assist you in everyday accident avoidance. The car feels like a great driving machine, handling is great, tight to the road the interiors are sporty and refined. the outside, well let's just say: it is not your average soccer mom's drive. I am a sports car junkie and the FX35 was the perfect ""bigger"" car to get when my wife had to get rid of her Land Rover... I love driving the FX 35 when the Z4 is taking a well deserved rest!"

infiniti,fx35,2005,Susana , 08/14/2005,10+++,4,"After owning Maximas for some years with the final Nissan being a very sluggish Pathfinder, it was time to step up to my dream of owning an Infiniti.  I started with a small 4- door sedan, then a medium-sized luxury sedan,and finally settling into my FX- 35 Crossover, having wanted to get back into a SUV larger style, but not as large as Infiniti's SUV.  I wish I had tacked on $8,000 more for the FX-45 with the GPS System, but that will be my next vehicle.  Overall, it suits my height, and although the seats are not as luxuriously comfortable as my previous Infiniti, I am totally happy with it.  Trunk space is more than ample, & I tuck a lot of necessary (all the time)items in my FX-35.  10+++"

I feel like a teen getting her first vehicle at 16.  After reading the forums and going thru Consumer Reports ... I feel I made a magnificent decision. I had the Trailblazer,  Mercedes 500ML, the Mercedes CLK and so on ... not one vehicle I've owned or driven compares to this one ... My husband says on a scale of 1-10, this is definitely a 12. My teen loves it as well;  he dissed every other vehicle I even considered."

The interior finishes could use some improvement in order to make the car as exciting on the inside as it is on the outside. The tech package is a definite must and the backup camera a welcome feature. My experience with Santa Monica Infinity was so horrible (I have never been treated with such dishonesty and disrespect in my life) it affected my enjoyment of the car at first, but now I love it. I have had wonderful experiences with Southbay Infinity and highly recommend them. I wish I had gone there to buy my car. They will definitely be doing all of my service in the future as they did on my QX4."

infiniti,fx35,2005,IanB, 10/28/2005,Outstanding,4,"I purchased the Infiniti to replace my Jaguar XJS Convertible, I was looking for something very sporty, but something that I could share with my family and something that I could take to Lowes that would hold more than a couple of shopping bags. This SUV has a fantastic suspension, if you like a very firm sports car suspension, it corners exceedingly well but it's not for those drivers who like a soft ride.  My wife hates the ride, she calls it bouncy, but as I said it's firm and you definitely get feedback from the road.  This is a car that does not float, it stays glued to the ground at all time.  Power is always adequate, but a tad delayed if punched, maybe due to an electronic throttle."
infiniti,fx35,2005,eliump, 12/12/2005,Step on it and go in style,4,"2005 FX35 non-sport, technology package. Non-sport chosen for a more comfortable ride (18"" wheels vs. 20"" wheels and stiffer suspension).  With spitited driving, 20 MPG in summer & 17 in winter.  Compared to my previous Subaru Outbacks, the performance of the FX's AWD is good, but not great. When driving HWY speeds on a sporatically snow covered HWY, the back end of the FX started to slip out. Being used to AWD systems, I didn't over-correct and I immediately felt the FX's AWD system spinning wheels to make the proper adjustments. Still, I didn't expect that loss of traction on a flat, straight HWY. I've since put a set of Blizzaks on and I've experienced quite an improvement in traction"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Steve-O, 12/27/2005,Superb Driving Experience,4,"The exterior design & interior quality are unparalleled. This sport-ute grabs attention on the street. It's fun to drive and is incredibly comfortable and well designed. I researched this car extensively before buying and have no regrets. I opted for the sport & tech packages. The 20's (wheels) make a bold statement, and the nav system is a must. The FX is for someone looking for good performance and the ability to hit the snow & haul passengers. The rear reclining seats are a great innovation, and provide exceptional comfort for rear passengers. As researched, and now experienced, the only faults of this car are par MPG (17-19) and a little stiff ride (w/ the 20's), otherwise - incredible!!"

infiniti,fx35,2005,mw06, 01/11/2006,FX35 quality,4,At first I was put off by the how much the road was translated to the interior but the responsiveness of the suspension -- particularly the stability when cornering--makes the stiffness of the feel  well worth it.  This crossover is definitely not for the casual cruiser who just wants to pick-up groceries and sit-up higher than most drivers on the road.  Get this car if you:  1.  like to drive with spirit. 2.  have got $$ to burn on gas 3.  have reason to carry 3-4 people + a pet with any regularity. 4.  expect to have snow or inclement weather more than a few times every year (plan to get real snow tires because the  factory installed are NO GOOD.) 5.  like style & individuality
infiniti,fx35,2005,Russ, 01/20/2006,"7 months in, and all's well",4,"What's not to like? Not much... Handles, accelerates and generally runs well.  I've added some aftermarket items such as a cold air intake, and plenum riser and stabilizer bar.  All of these extras plus the car's original features make it a wonderful compromise between car and SUV.  If you want a cushy SUV that is less sporty, then the Acura MDX or Lexus is for you.  If you want a little bite, and some more meat on the bone then the FX35 will give you all of that, and your neighbor's wife with 3 kids won't be driving one either (unless she's a little hip and edgy)"
infiniti,fx35,2005,EVALLEN, 01/23/2006,Perfect Stylin,4,"I love driving this car....it has a fun growl, great handling, good speed and pick up on the on/off ramps.  It turns very well and is just a beautiful car.  My only dislikes is that when I try to turn it on sometimes, it does not come on.  I have to turn off the auto lights, the air and the radio in order for it to come on.  It is a new car, so not sure why that is happening.  Overall, two thumbs up on this Infiniti winner!  If your thinking about it....I say go Buy it!"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Stan, 02/03/2006,just my view,4,"Overall, I like this car.  However, at times, when making turns, the wheels feel like they are a little loose. Also the car make a little start-up noise after sitting in cooler weather (i.e., 40-60 degrees...I live in south Florida)"
infiniti,fx35,2005,AussieBuff, 02/08/2006,Awesome Vehicle,4,"I have now owned this vehicle for 13,000 miles and don't regret one of them! Over the Thanksgiving Holiday I drove from southern Louisiana to Chicago in 14 1/2 hours with no residual road pain. I then drove the same route back on the following Sunday. I then packed the vehicle and moved to California with a side trip to Colorado to ski. Another wonderful trip however it was a little slick in the mountains west of Denver as these tires are not made for snow, deep snow at that on Interstate 70. The ride and steering are responsive, the engine has loads of low-end torque, the Bose sound system is fantastic, and I love the looks from other drivers wishing they owned it. I will have own another!"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Mike, 02/25/2006,Great Vehicle,4,"Having owend this SUV for a short time, I am amazed at the way it feels and drives.  I was considering Volvo XC 90, VW Touareg, M-B M-Class, and the BMX X-5. The FX was the best looking,  best handling, and feels like a sports car, not a ""family car""."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Crossovered, 04/12/2006,Not your average box on wheels,4,"Excellent styling, reliability, handling. If you like driving, like sporty cars but hate the fact that these cars can go under rigs, and do not need lots of cargo room, this is a good option. Drove rx330, MDX (no German or Sweedish SUVs because of lousy reliability) - and the FX won by a mile. "
infiniti,fx35,2005,john, 06/29/2006,"Wow, A Brave Car to Build",4,"I'm just turning in a 2 year old FX and wanted to share a comment or two. This will be a great used car. Reliabilty has been OUTSTANDING. The quality of the leather doesn't quite match the Lexus I've owned, but, in every other respect, the mechanical quality has been great, and, this is a hoot to drive. Style cramps the trunk a bit, but, it is a distinctive design among all the look-alikes. Gas economy was 16-18 mpg: not great, but, this car is very, very, fast. I know Infiniti has made a few minor improvements, but, the electronics on the car are also best in class. This has been a very good experience."

infiniti,fx35,2005,Jobu, 07/25/2006,Content as hell,5,"I love this car.  Period.  Has no trunk but I knew that when I got it.  Let alone sport suspension, standard suspension is bumpy - but if you test drive, easy to see that.  I average 19 MPG combined city+highway.  Highway actually close to 25 so I am not complaining - it is higher than I expected.  Sole grumpy point is that you can't play MP3s in the CD drive.  Why why why?!!!"

still loveing it.  For those who think

get a lot more then you think in the

infiniti,fx35,2005,Jon Elu, 11/12/2004,Luv it!,4,"I've had my copper FX35 for not quite a 
year now and I love it! Its fast, its 
comfortable and everbody including the 
gent in the Rolls is checking it out. 
The 6 cylinder is suprisingly quick and 
the power stays with you well past the 
speed limit. The cargo space is limited 
for some but I find it is more than 
adequate for my daily use. If I fold 
the seats down I can put alot in it 
with the exception of something very 
large. But who buys a crossover vehicle 
if you're hauling refridgerators. Its 
sporty, fun to drive, and big enough 
for my companions with their golf bags. 
All in all its the styling, comfort and 
impressive handling that will sell you 
the FX35."

and gladly make 2 trips!  Lots of

now.  I don't have a single complaint 
about this vehicle.  Well, other than 
I don't get to spend every minute of 
the day in it!  The power is punchy, 
the steering unbelievably true, and 
the ride smooth and comfortable.

I didn't get the 20-inch wheels 
because I thought I detected slightly 
more road noise and rougher ride.  
I've never regretted that decision.  
The 18-inch grip the road and provide 
a very smooth ride.  

This car not only turns heads, but 
I've had people actually approach me 
on the street to ask me about it."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Rob, 12/18/2004,The 2005 Infiniti FX35 - Wow,4,"This vehicle is fun to drive. It also has very
comfortable seats. In fact, its rear 
seats recline and are more comfortable 
than most cars' front seats. It does not 
drive like an SUV at all. It has quite a bit of
power - 280 hp.  This is fantastic, 
compared to the Lexus 330 which has only
230 hp or even the BMW X5 which has only 225 hp.
Also, I love how it turns heads when I'm driving it 
around. "

absolutely love it.  It is black with 
the brick leather interior and it is 
gorgeous.  With the touring package and

helpful and you just can't beat
the warranty and the perks that go with it.  I 
highly recomment it!"

infiniti,fx35,2005,Joe, 01/16/2005,Fun and Flashy,5,"I've owned this SUV for 11 months and I love it !  It handles like a sports car and has more horsepower than most SUV's out there.  I'm getting 20mpg overall and that's pretty good for 280hp. The biggest benefit is that the interior is extremely comfortable.  I have long legs and no other SUV fit like this one, except maybe the Nissan Armada.  Fun to drive ALL the time ! Firm ride but it's OK if you get the 18"" wheels instead of the 20"" wheels and pass on any Sports Package. The Technology Package may be worth it for the rear view camera and full color LCD display, easier to read in bright light and GPS would be nice."
infiniti,fx35,2005,dontnomuch, 01/21/2005,"Fun to drive, practical, good value",4,"I originally wanted an FX45, but the V6 in the FX35 makes the V8 seem pointless. This car has a fantastic engine...sounds great and good torque. Car and Driver called the FX a sports sedan with a backpack and that sums it up well.  The cargo space is not huge but it serves me well. The interior design is a bit inconsistent. The levers used to lower the rear seats are a brilliant idea. But the clock placement is just not intuitive. Also, I would like to be able to get outside airflow into the cabin; I don't like running the AC all the time. The gas mileage (14 mpg) is crappy, but I can use 87 octane so that works out ok. Dealer service is really classy(they sent flowers after buying!)"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Kristen Metzinger, 01/22/2005,The biggest car I will ever love!,4,"I feel that one story will sum up this review well. I was driving 80 mph in the fast lane and I hit some large road debris. The debris blew a 5 in diameter hole in my tire and it bounced down the side of my car. What an ugly mess. 

Anyway I am going 80 blow the tire compleatly out, debris hits the car and the car continues to drive smooth and strail, not even a jolt. I had my then 8 month old son in the car and he slept right thru it. I was more worried about the bad area of town that this happened in than the safety performance of the car. It preformed wonderfully!!!"
infiniti,fx35,2005,TAZ, 01/24/2005,Exciting SUV crossover!,4,The looks and drive of the FX 35 is an exciting experience for a SUV.  After 3000 Miles I am very satisfied with most all features and quality.  I am approached about once a week by someone admiring and asking about the vehicle.

I have had the car for almost 3 thousand miles and took it on a ski trip, which was 400 miles each way.  On the highway the car rocked at 120+ mph, and the engine really hauls.  On the curves you have to look down and check its not a sports car.  And believe it or not with the 18's and all seasons its gets going in 10 inches of snow.  Great Bose stereo, good build quality. It doesnt feel japanese it feels German, and having a BMW and an Audi as well it really doesn't give up anything to them esp in performance.  Plenty of room inside and it really is very comfortable.  Aside in how many cars under 70K can you get people to pull you over and comment on the car!"

I ordered a 2005 Nissan Pathfinder LE silver with black interior. A friend of mine, who is in the car business, said to go look at the FX again! When I drove the FX, I fell in love with it and bought it. I have enjoyed the vehicle and the gas mileage really is not that best. I think it's best in class. The Pathfinder would have had 17/23, my FX gets 18/23. Go get One!"

Coming from a bmw 330xi, i wanted a sports suspension,but felt the fx35 with 20 inch tires, was to rough a ride,so i had the dealer exchange for 18""tires. now i get the sport car suspension,with a better quality ride. This car handles on rails. (you give up a little handling,but get back a better ride) remember you would still have the sport suspension,which gives you that non floating,glue to the road,tight feeling car. I recommend black interior,looks great with the new etched alluminum trim.If you want a sports car with utility,this is your car.Get the sports suspension. "
infiniti,fx35,2005,Monica, 03/05/2005,"Fast, Fun and Luxurious",4,"Perfect for short term or long term driving.

infiniti,fx35,2005,Jon K., 03/14/2005,Good to Go,4,"Driving this vehicle is like driving a good handling sports car on a larger platform.  You feel comfortable, protected, and insulated from road noise except, of course, the humming of the engine.  Everything works well and is reliable.  The sound system is fabulous ( it is concert quality ).  My only pet peeve is that before you are ready you have to get fuel.  Poor fuel economy.  But that is the price to pay for having this sports car feeling SUV with all its power and luxury.  Great ride!"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Paul, 03/19/2005,FX35,4,"I have owned this car for almost 1 year now.  I truly love the heck out of this car.  This car is a blast to drive.  I also drive race cars, and i can honestly say this is almost as fun as driving a race car.  I have the fully loaded AWD model with the sport package, which is a must.  While the car lacks a little hoss out of the hole, once it gets up to 3K in RPM's, it will scream.  Do not buy this car without the AWD and the Sport Package beacuse you will not get the same experience.  I run this car very hard into corners, and I have never been able to get this car loose or break traction.  I have only gone up to 132 mph due to trafic, but i think it has much more to give on the top end."
infiniti,fx35,2005,John Cameron, 03/20/2005,Just improve the ride!,4,"The FX35 is a great all around SAV for those who don't want or need one of those HUGE GAS GUZZLERS! There is room for four, and space a plenty. It sounds, looks, and handles great! Just don't exceed the handling limits. My FX35 has been trouble free to date; the first service at 7500 miles beind just an oil change. If they fix the ride I will buy another."

Extremely comfortable driver environment, terrific handleing, and with proper side mirror adjustment great vision of the road.  The large tires do give a firm ride, but you should know this going in.  I still look forward to getting into my FX everyday."

We drive mostly in NYC and find it still turns heads and solicits questions even in the least car-friendly town in America. It's a joy to get out on the highway with the FX35. But in city driving it corners magnificently and the comfort level is right up there with Trump's or Bloomberg's limo.
infiniti,fx35,2005,Michael, 04/02/2005,Infiniti FX 35,4,"The car is fun to drive.  Setbacks that I see are the blind spots, and the fuel economy which are poor.

You cannot beat the exterior styling of this car wtih any other car in this price range "
infiniti,fx35,2005,merlin, 04/02/2005,"Good, but...",3,"Handles very well. Ride is a bit rough. Very well designed,engineered, and built. Gets a lot of looks. With about 17000 miles I haven't had any problem, except for a serious issue with the driver's power seat controls, which are poorly positioned on the right horizontal surface of the seat and press on the right thigh. Never noticed this in the 3 test drives I took (one lasting 45 minutes).Friends in service dept at dealer tell me ""off the record"" this is definitely a problem pattern, but nothing can---or will---be done to correct it. Too bad they wont bite the bullet and do the right thing.  "

No many on the road yet don't know if it's price or people just don't know what to make of it. But really gets the looks!  The performance and get up and go of this vehicle is excellent and a hoot to drive.  Gas is so high so its hard to tell gas mileage but average for this type of car.  
infiniti,fx35,2005,Lynne O, 04/22/2005,Soccer Mom no-more,4,"Moving from a Chrysler minivan to the Infinity FX has been a thrill.  Such a distinctive style and lots of fun to drive. Plenty of get up and go in the hills. The ""Liquid Copper"" color is often mistaken for ""Burnt Orange"" here in U.T. Longhorn country -- but it looks great and I get respect on the road! ;-) Lots of smart design features and you do get used to the ""blind spots."""
infiniti,fx35,2005,Elizabeth, 04/22/2005,Great Car for Fun,4,"The FX is a great car.  Enjoy its drive and charm. People love looking at the car, but they also love slamming their doors into it!  Could be they're jealous.  A few fixes are in order such as, could use quieter braking system. Needs plastic stripe on back as upper portion of bumper easily dents and could use a little better visuals.  Can't see in certain places.  The silver/chrome inside the car easily scratches.  However, I love the look  of the car and it will be difficult to trade-in for another model.  Can't wait until Infiniti comes up with next years model.  Hope Infiniti takes suggestions to upgrade certain areas of the car because the sales would be unstoppable. "

While I really liked the G35, my wife was sold on the seating height and looks of the FX so we got one. Drove a loaded sport and hated the ride. Went with the luxury and technology packages (my wife had to have the navigation system and I wanted the smart cruise control), and are both happy with that decision. This is ton of car for the money in my honest opinion, so if a sporty SUV styled vehicle with loads of electronic toys is something you are after, give this one a test drive!"

I have no complaints about the vehicle or infiniti. The dealership i purchased my car at, could not have been more accomodating to me and worked fairly with me on the price.

My kids think the reclining rear seats and dvd system are the best.This baby handles like a dream and is great to look at. So when it was time for myself to make a purchase I looked around and was just about to ""settle on"" an X5 which didn't blow me away so I thought to myself why not stay with a great thing, so now we'll have a White and Black sittin in the driveway.

For those sports enthusiasts, the ride is fantastic. The large brakes helps you to stop on a dime without a skid. But, be careful you will go 90 before you know it, the ride is very smooth. It sets on the Infiniti's G35 chassis which makes it ride and handle smoothly and not bumoy like a truck. It's a powerful yet classy ride. I'm one happy buyer."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Forrest, 05/23/2005,My 1st luxury car.,4,"My first luxury car is my first ""fun-to- drive"" car!  This car drives like nothing I have ever owned before.  Plenty of power, stability, class!  The GPS is excellent, and for folks who like road-trips...don't leave home without it!  I usually go for the classic cars to drool over, but, I love my ""Batmobile""!"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Ty Chee, 05/24/2005,"The ""Sport"" in Sport Utility Vehicle",4,"The designers at Infinity said they wanted to create a ""Bionic Cheatah"" when they built the FX, well this cat really roars! When looking for a daily driver I needed a car that could handle the everyday grind and at the same time be blast to drive. The FX is fun around the twisties and never fails to entertain. From the thump of its 13  speaker Bose stereo to the throaty growl from its polished duel exhaust tips, the FX is always music to my ears. I got mine fully loaded with the Touring, Technology, and Sport packages. I also added XM Radio and the rear DVD entertainment system. I've only had my FX for a little over a week, but my feeling is that this honeymoon will last for quite sometime. "
infiniti,fx35,2005,LoriW, 05/25/2005,Awesome Car!,4,"I have always owned a Lexus or Mercedes (sedans and SUV's)so this is my first Infiniti.  WOW!  I have been missing a whole lot of fun!  The FX35 has alot of power compared to the ""gutless wonder"" RX300 I had.  I am really enjoying driving this car and would highly recommend it."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Tomb Raider, 06/07/2005,Never thought I would own this but...,5,"I was looking at the Pathfinder which was way too big, and someone smarter recommended I go for the luxury SUV. Wow, what an amazing vehicle! I've never driven an SUV that handles like a sports car! I don't feel the extra weight at all. I got the Tech/Tour package...best investment I had ever made."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Rob, 06/06/2005,Lovin it!!!,4,"I've had my FX now for a couple weeks and I'm lovin it! This car/suv has a great feel to it. It drives like a sports car, but still has some ground clearance like an SUV. Has enough room for 4 large adults to sit comfortably, especially since the rear sits recline. "
infiniti,fx35,2005,anne c, 07/02/2005,Great sport suv,4,"Excellent power for a V6.  If you like a ride that is smooth, with sports car handling, and some room to haul things, this is perfect. Just got this car this week, and its interior noise is quieter than my Acura TL. "
infiniti,fx35,2005,RPM15, 07/16/2005,"Good, Sort of...",3,"The handling & style are wonderful. So is the fun to drive cache'. I have had problems with the electrical system. The left channel of my stereo does not work and Infiniti cannot fix it. Also, there are clanks comming from the driver front side which cannot be fixed. I really like this car, fun to drive and handles well, but cannot wait to get back to BMW to a company that cares when there is a problem about the car. Infiniti corporate does not offer any help when problems arise. Too bad, the car was on the way to being great."
infiniti,fx35,2005,JFF, 07/16/2005,Funtabulous,4,"Absolutely the most fun, sporty, SUV I've every driven;  I've owned two Jeep Grand Cherokees, driven several rental SUVs, including Lincoln Navigator, Ford Explorer..neither can hold a candle to the bold, sexy Infinit FX35!"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Brandon, 07/18/2005,Stand out from the crowd,4,"I test drove all the SUV's on the market and have owned 6 new luxuary cars in the last 6 years. I wanted an SUV that would stand out and at the same time give me the performance of a sedan, reasonable fuel consumption and reliability. This is the first vehicle I have owned in 6 years that I really love to drive, summer or winter. The styling and finish is excellent and although not the biggest cargo space for an SUV, definitely sufficient. Superb road handeling, and always gets looks. The 3.5 engine is rated as one of the best in the world, and for good reason. All in all an excellent choice, and the service at the dealership has also been exceptional."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Omar, 07/18/2005,Why Did I Wait So Long?,4,"I recently leased an FX35 with the touring and technology packages, which includes the navigation system and rear- view camera.  The car is a real head- turner and performs beautifully - at freeway speeds you think you're in a sport coupe.  The interior is nice, but doesn't have the ""luxury"" look - more utilitarian.  Lots of dashboard buttons, but I've found that I've used almost every one at some point.  Fuel economy for an SUV is good - getting 19mpg on mostly freeway driving.  I had heard a lot about blind spot problems, but I haven't had any issues at all.  Ultimately, if you want to drive a sports car in the summer and an SUV in the winter, this is a perfect compromise."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Rick Miller, 07/30/2005,A Crossover SUV,4,I needed an all wheel drive car for a move to the NE so the styling on the FX35 was attractive. I have not driven it in snow yet so I will update the review this winter. I have a steep driveway and it will be a challenge to get out when it snows.  We traveled 1800 miles in the car and it drove like a dream. I haven't driven that far in 30 years yet I enjoyed this trip due to the car.
infiniti,fx35,2005,David Hixon, 08/07/2005,David's FX,4,"The FX is a Great Car to drive. It's performance is outstanding, class of it's own. The design is exceptional and overall comfort is excellent. You give up a little comfort for the Sports feeling and handling, but who notices. The finish on the paint makes taking care of the FX that much easier. I love the color, Diamond Graphite. Thanks Infiniti for a Great SUV."

infiniti,fx35,2005,Ron of AZ, 08/07/2005,I think I'm in trouble,4,"I've had this car a week now and all I can think about is driving it. What a pleasure! Drives like a sports car. I'm getting better gas mileage than I thought I would from a sport/SUV, approx. 18.5 in the city. Love the Intelligent key system. Just put the fob in your pocket and you never have to take it out again until you get home. I'm really pleased with this purchase."
infiniti,fx35,2005,ilker, 08/08/2005,Infiniti,5,"I find the fx 35 a very well designed car.  Not only does it look good, but it also drives very smootly and well.  It is also very fun to drive."

infiniti,fx35,2005,JP, 08/19/2005,Great sports car with a roomy cargo,5,"If you're looking for an SUV, this may not be the right car you. This is a roomy sports car. I like everything about this car and its ownership experience. Great looks, great performance, super reliable, 5 star crash test ratings, one of the best working, most efficient navigation system in the market... I'm so happy with this car, I'm considering of getting another FX, this time a 45, for even more serious sporting. Very good 4wd system - comparable with Carrera 4. Reviewers complaining about hard ride and lack of trunk space, there's nothing wrong with the car, this car is just not designed to do that kind of work. "
infiniti,fx35,2005,John Morris, 08/25/2005,Great Vehicle,4,Have owned this vehicle since 3/17/05 & truly love it.  The only drawback is the rear window vision.  Have had to learn better use of side mirrors.  Regarding Dealership:   Sales process was average.  F&I was substandard.  Service has been excellent.  If you could buy this vehicle w/o going into the dealership it would be great.
infiniti,fx35,2005,simpleton, 09/16/2005,Pay at the pump,3,"Disregard the stated gas mileage on the window sticker. Figure on getting about 20% less than what is listed.  Fun to drive, but the seats are to narrow and the controls on the seat are a pain. Also, no interior hatch release, big pain. The memory seat function won't work until the key is on. Therefore, you have to enter the vechile to adjust the seat. Kinda defeats the purpose huh?  A definite must add is the clear bra. If you don't the flat face front area will be chipped before you get home.  All that aside, great car. Nothings perfect."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Blades25, 09/15/2005,"I loved the car so much, I got a 2nd one",5,"Great car.  My fiance loved mine so much, when she was looking for her car, she also go the FX in another color.  We have the tech. package which we love.  Never get lost again.  It also has the intelligent cruise control, Set your speed and it will pace the car infront of you until you have open road and then it will speed up to your set speed.  It will also slow down if a car comes in front of you.  Great car, get it."
infiniti,fx35,2005,finsfx, 09/30/2005,I like this car so much....,4,"...that I bought it again.  Had an 03 FX35, traded for a Honda S2000.  After 6 months, I missed the FX so much that I traded in the S2000 for a new 05 FX35 Diamond Graphite/Willow/Sport.  Took a beating on the trade but am happy the FX is back.  Great performance, handling, design.  Stereo is excellent.  Tire brand stayed the same -- meaning it will last 20k miles and it's time for replacement.  Oh well, the price you pay...."
infiniti,fx35,2005,jbryson1, 09/29/2005,Cayenne Alternative For Real,4,"Loaded FX w/touring and tech. Sport pack, but, swapped 18s for 20s (better riding tires). Had for 14 months. Excellent build reliability. Fuel economy 16.5 on ave. Goes like a bat, can't imagine the FX45. Motor noise gets a bit much w/windows open. Back up camera is well worth it. Ride is firm, but, handling and throttle response is incredible. Very good navi system, touch screen would be nice, but, the system itself is better than Lexus' offers. Give this car a try, it will surprise you."
infiniti,fx35,2005,George, 10/15/2005,Fun To Drive,4,"The FX 35 is fun to drive.  Not too crazy about the fact that premium gas is required with the cost of fuel these days.  Gas mileage is about 18.3 on the open road with no traffic. Ride is rough, but then it is a sports car type vehicle.  Handles real well on the turns.  A bit noisy.  Moonroof should close automatically when the vehicle is turned off.  Seat controls should be relocated off of the seat, difficult to get to.  There are no running lights during the daylight hours when the control is set to auto. "
infiniti,fx35,2005,Geez, 10/20/2005,I really do luv this vehicle,4,"Great little vehicle, looks like an SUV, however, while driving you feel like you're in a [sports] car ... The front and back end look tough ... doesn't look or feel like your typical vehicle. Had the ML500, Lexus 330 and a Trailblazer LTZ ... Despite the reviews on the Trailblazer, I loved it the best, but this little FX won me over hands down.  "
infiniti,fx35,2005,mick3, 11/10/2005,the SUV for Drivers,4,"I've owned the FX 35 for 6 months and look forward to getting behind the wheel every time.  I recommend going with 18 in wheels for a better ride/drive balance.  I went with the tech package to get the rearview camera, and with the blind spots it was well worth the extra $$.  It definitely has love it or hate it styling, but most people love it.  the biggest drawback is its fuel economy - I get about 15 MPG city and 19 MPG highway.  With gas at $3/gallon, it has affected the costr to own.  Service at the dealership has been impeccable."
infiniti,fx35,2005,John, 11/12/2005,WOW What a Car,4,Had not thought about the Infiniti till i saw it at the state fair.  Sat in it and fell in love with it.  Test drove it and read reviews here.  It is everything and more you could want in a sporty SUV. It is not a car for frequent trips to HomeDepot or Lowes it is for the highway!!.. Drives like a dream. I have never had a car handle the road like this one does.  I cannot wait for my first long distance road trip.  Infiniti has a well kept secret here.  The ride is firm but not bumpy as some say but if you know anything about sporty cars the ride should be firm.
infiniti,fx35,2005,GMK, 11/28/2005,FX35 driver,4,I see jaws drop at the sight of my FX35.  One reason I really love this car is because it looks like no other on the road.  It's a very sporty comfortable ride with lots of bells and whistles.
infiniti,fx35,2005,Brian S., 11/25/2005,good crossover,3,"I have had the car for 1 week. This is a good choice if your looking for a car but need more room and don't like wagons. This is my first suv after years of subaru wagons both low & high end. Good power, great handling, nice stereo, good looks. 20 inch wheels look good but the ride is very stiff with them. Trunk is smaller than some wagons. If you have a large dog you will need to remove the trunk cover for room. "
infiniti,fx35,2005,AWB, 11/29/2005,FX35 SUV is really a Sport,4,"I must start off by stating that my previous car was a Lexus GS400.  While the FX35 is not quite as fast it is far more sporting than any other AWD SUV I tested before purchasing this vehicle.  I needed the AWD for winter Driving and I needed a some utility.  The FX has less utility than most mid sized SUV's but it is the only one in this price class with this much SPORT.  It loves the back roads and and I recently took it on a 2000 mile trip and I was surprized how comforable the seats were for the long haul (I am 6'1"" and over 60 years old).  I really liked the comfort of the drivers seat.  It has lots of leg room!"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Peter, 11/29/2005,"Looks good at first, but beware!",3,"The FX 35 has a few glaring issues. First, I just couldn't get the driver's seat to be comfortable. 800 ways to adjust, but none comfortable. After one year of driving, it ruined my back. Second, the rear heating/ac vents run under the car with no insulation. That means, in cold weather, the heated air is cold by the time it comes out. Completely unacceptable in my book. ""Nothing we can do about it"" according to the Infiniti dealer. ""It's up to Infinity specs."" If that's specs, wow! Then the front door swings open and bounces right back. Quite the surprise if you turn the other way to grab something before you try to get out. Again ""up to factory specs."" I really question Infiniti Quality."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Bonnie, 12/19/2005,A Good Choice For Fun and Safety!,5,"Driving this car is in a word, fun!  It handles like a sports car, vehicle response is immediate and aggressive.  I gave up my full-size SUV for something less soccer-mom-like, and with automobiles like this on the market, I will never go back!  The interior is comfortable, clean and cozy.  The car is beautiful . . . it will turn heads when you drive by! "

infiniti,fx35,2005,Rick, 01/13/2006,Exciting and Fun to Drive!,5,"The styling is excellent and the interior makes you comfortable.  Plenty of room.  Great handling, response and don't need any more power. The higher seating gives a more comanding and comfortable feel. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys feeling the road.  This is definitely not for people who want to feel cushy."
infiniti,fx35,2005,FRANK MONTEROSO, 01/14/2006,Great value,4,"This is the first non american car purchased, and now i see that the Big Three have a lot of work to catch up to these cars, the quality of the ride is unbeleivabe, and workmanship is execellent.I would recommend the FX35 to all my friends."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Lisa, 01/14/2006,I love it!!,4,"I have owned my FX35 for about 2 weeks.  I love it!!!  Only drawbacks- watch your head getting in because the window is a little low, driver handgrip interferes with window controls and there should be a change holder.  Pros- Handles well, stylish, Bose stereo sounds fantastic, navigations has already saved me!"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Max, 01/17/2006,Great Car,5,This is a perfect automobile for anyone who wants a sports car but needs more room. Dont expect to get good fuel performance because it is hard not to drive this car aggressive. 
infiniti,fx35,2005,newdriver, 01/16/2006,Very good vehicle,4,"The FX35 is an excellent intro vehicle into the Infiniti line.  This is our first Infiniti and it won't be our last.  What also makes it such a good vehicle is the dealers who were willing to work with us.  Dealers in five different cities were helpful and persuasive.  Ultimately we purchased the vehicle from a city about 100 miles away from our home.  It was well worth the salesman's extra ""touches"" that he put into the car and how he closed the deal. "
infiniti,fx35,2005,Disappointed, 03/06/2006,Surprisingly Disappointed :(,3,"Love the look - and you won't see many of these on the road! However, don't buy on this alone (like I did).  Caution if you get motion sickness easily!  I've owned mine a week now, and unfortunately I was ready to take it back after 1 day.  For those who don't know what a stiff ride/tight suspension means, pay attention to the way this vehicle rides - even the tar lines on roads feel like big bumps.  On some roads with multiple repairs I actually feel like my eyes are bouncing - making it not only uncomfortable but annoying.  Also, make sure you consider the seating.  I ache when I get out - both my back and seat; and I'm a healthy woman with no aches/pains - until I drive in this seat.   "
infiniti,fx35,2005,Will Jansen, 06/24/2006,From Z to SUV,5,"We have owned a 350Z, one of the first G35's and now and FX35. All have been really fun to drive and been very reliable. The FX is a great size and a fun car both around town and on the highway. You hardly feel it shift and yet you can get out of the way of trouble when needed."

infiniti,fx35,2005,rsg1963, 09/05/2006,Just Happy....,4,"This should not be catagorized as an SUV.  This is really more like a 350Z with a lot more room and 4wheel drive. It is uncanny how it corners, and 280 HP out of a V6 - ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Good stuff, well designed."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Decemberlarry, 09/12/2006,Love this car!,4,"I traded in a Mercedes ML and this car has made driving fun again. Everything from the tuned exhaust to the seats to the stereo is superior to the Mercedes. The quality and fit are also better. I've driven this car in 11"" of snow and at 135 mph on Hwy 80 (in the Nevada desert). It performs equally as well in both. Love the pick-up, love the corning, love the handling. It's a sporty ride though, not a soft luxury ride; this car is for drivers."
infiniti,fx35,2005,Ed, 10/06/2006,Excellent vehicle,4,"I was first attracted to the design.  Owning it for 2 years now, everything about this car has lived up to it's promise.  Gas mileage is the only low point.  At 42k miles, I am at 18.1 avg. mpg.  That's a combination of hwy. and city driving.  It's very cool to still get comments from people on the street about how great a design it is.  No regrets buying this one."
infiniti,fx35,2005,ACVance, 10/09/2006,Never Disappointed!!!!,4,"The Infiniti FX is an automobile that I am very proud to own. Each day when I get into my vehicle I actually look forward to the 40 min commute. It handles like a dream, the sound system is awesome and for my 5'4""frame it is very comfortable. As a previous owner of a Dodge Stealth Turbo I can appreciate the fact that it has the feel of a sports car and yet the safety of AWD.  I live in the foothills outside of Denver and it is great in inclement weather conditions. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CAR TO MY MOTHER!!!!!"
infiniti,fx35,2005,Anthony, 10/23/2006,"Almost a perfect car, but...",4,"I love my FX35, but I'm looking to get rid of it now. I can no longer take ""driving"" the car. There is no comfortable position to be in. Either your knee's are in the dash or the steering wheel is too far away. My biggest problem is the steering wheel is far too small! My hands honestly hurt during my commute. I'm 24 years old and I doubt I have bad hands or anything like that. If you only drive a few miles than this car is an awesome car, but not a commuter friendly car. "

I am trading it in for a 2007 simply because I don't plan on driving this much in the future. Four of my neighbors have the same exact color FX that I have so this is a really good reason to purchase another. I have had absolutely no problems in 46,000 miles. The dealership provides excellent service, second to none. The 20"" tires are good for about 25,000 miles. The brakes sometime act jerky if you attempt to stop while turning. They made an adjustment and the problem seems solved. I have had Mercedes and BMW's, the BMW my wife drives.

I have had zero mechanical issues in either FX. Very reliable.  I spend 4 hours/day in car, and this is my rolling office.  Sports car, luxury sedan, and some utility makes it perfect for me.  I have black/brick, all options/ chromes, and can't find another car I'd rather drive.  I have much experience buying tires and I recommend 20"" Yokahamas or Nittos.  from Discount Tire.

infiniti,fx35,2006,Martin Pollmueller, 09/05/2007,a real dissapointment,2,"I love the look of this vehicle. It handles well and the engine is well suited for this type of truck. The interior is attractice and the car feels solid as a higher end one should. I bought this car based on the good reliability and performance reviews. Unfortunately, I got a lemon. Fine, it can happen to any manufacturer. However, Infiniti ( Nissan)really doesn't care about the customer once the sale is made. In the first 5000 miles, both the frontend and transmission had to be replaced. It took seven months before the work was performed.

infiniti,fx35,2006,Brian BTLG, 12/25/2009,Two months in...,4,"I loved the styling and there doesn't seem to be many on the road so it is quite unique. Drove Lexus, Mercedes, Acura, and Lincoln. Infiniti gives you the most tech features for the money with AWD. I've owned Nissan's before and they've always been reliable. Nav is awesome, bose system is the best I've owned yet, seats are very comfortable on longer trips, snow mode is perfect in deep snow, brick (orange) interior is simply amazing, lots of power, plenty of room and storage, and very comfortable ride. Have a good friend with X3 and another with Denali. This blows those away. Down sides: Barely getting 16 MPG and calls for premium fuel, poor rear visibility, and complicated bluetooth phone."

Always loved the styling and after driving it (and competitors) decided on the FX. I still love the driving experience, but not necessarily the ownership experience.  Have had multiple issues with having to return the vehicle to the dealership (which I admit, Infinity of Coconut Creek has been great) for many issues related to trim/cosmetics, I have also had to have 3 mechanical issues with the car that if I had to pay for out of pocket would have been very expensive if not covered under warranty.

After 15 years of driving Corvettes I was looking for a more confortable ride without giving up too much performance and the FX35 is exacly what I was looking for. I am disappointed with the sound system. I was hoping that 11 speakers, 300 watts and the Bose name would give me a better sound however, there is a lack of ""panoramic"" feel that is the standard of 5.1(surround) systems also, the subwoofers do not have the expected ""punch""."
infiniti,fx35,2006,Hawk8485, 02/11/2007,This is no truck!,4,"After 25 years of driving German sedans, this is our first Japanese made vehicle.  Quite impressive.  We did not want a truck for our first SUV, and the FX35 is a nice compromise between a sedan and a full sized truck based SUV.  Drives much like a sports car on steroids.  Powerful, responsive, and fun to drive, yet gets good gas mileage.  Smooth transmission, too, as it never has any abrupt shifts.  Rides like a nice sedan, but handles deep snow with aplomb.  Not as roomy as most SUVs as this vehicle is not meant for hauling a lot of ""stuff.""  Instead, it holds four people in excellent comfort, and handles like a car.  We also love the tv camera for backing up.  Great visibility all around."
infiniti,fx35,2006,Dustin Zaugg, 02/09/2016,Great suv,5,"I have owned my FX35 for approx 6 months.  It is cool as h*ll.  Mp3 not great but it makes up for it in cool points.  Bluetooth has a suck factor.  Lane departure. ...thank God you can shut that off.  Assisted cruise sometimes is a pain but if you hold the on/off button on the cruise down for 1.5 seconds it will turn into regular cruise control.  Great sound system.  Excellent in snow.  Great vehicle folks.

infiniti,fx35,2006,markJ, 10/12/2006,Just a darn cool SUV!,4,"Although I'm 50, this SUV makes me feel 10 years younger every time I drive it. The handling is supreme  and Ive owned both a Shelby GT350 and a Porsche, so I know a little about handling. Yes, the ride is a bit rough. And the exhaust makes a little more noise than I would prefer. But hey, this is no Soccer-Moms SUV. If you want that, get a (yawn) Lexus and be done with it. This is a drivers SUV that can fit easily into a small space. When the rear seats go down its got plenty of room, and it can tow up to 3500 lb. So for me, its just the perfect SUV. And to top that off, I can get 25 mpg on the freeway should I choose. "
infiniti,fx35,2006,2006FX35, 01/02/2017,The Best Car I Ever Owned WAS SO PERFECT I MISS IT,5,"I never write reviews for anything but this car is worthy of a review because I absolutely loved it. I leased a 06 Black Obsidian on Wheat FX35 AWD w/ Sport/Tech Packages. This car was so much fun to drive! It was truly the perfect car for me, and now here I am in 2017 and I am looking for a 06-08 FX35. The handling/seating position and height/exhaust note/Bose system/Navigation were by far perfect. The seats were extremely comfortable. I truly loved and looked forward to driving it. Even when I had it I always said how could Infiniti create such a perfect car. The sticker new was 49k and after two years when my lease was up the buy price thy gave me was $41k, so I thought I would find one cheaper used but they took so long to go down in value! They really held their resale value well. After the FX i bought a 745i which i hated and sold, then leased a Z4 3.0si which I enjoyed, and bought my dream car which I will be keeping a 95 Hellrot 840ci. But out of all of the cars I've ever driven and owned I have never been happier driving my 06 FX35. I recently test drove a 2016 QX70, while it was nice it still wasnt the same. I would like to look into the FX50S but honestly for the price of what I can get a 06-08 FX35 for now that is all I need! Truly a great car and highly recommended.
"
infiniti,fx35,2006,Pam, 02/04/2006,I love my FX,4,"This is one of the few cars that I have owned that I absolutely love to drive. It drives like a sports car, yet gives the  functionality of a family SUV. Plus the exterior design is one I never get tired of looking at. I love this car!  "
infiniti,fx35,2006,Kevincito, 07/25/2006,Great combo of sport & luxury w/ tech!,4,"Wanted a sports car, needed the room...my FX35 was the perfect choice. Went from a G35 coupe and didn't sacrifice a lot of performance, but gained so much more. The tech toys are amazing, some of the most comfy seats I've ever sat in. Only 1 mpg less that my coupe on average! A blast to drive and looks awesome, with the great reliability of Infiniti."
infiniti,fx35,2006,Bob, 12/10/2006,Second Time Around,5,"I Picked up my '06 FX yesterday! This is my second FX! I put 52,000 miles on my '03 FX and loved it so much I bought another. With many improvements over the '03 I'm looking forward to several years in this one. I didn't buy the sports package this time. The ride with the standard 18"" tires is less harsh yet it still handles excellent. I enjoy the hands free package and blue tooth. So far I haven't had any complaints about my voice not coming across well on the phone. The interior comfort is one of the key features that led me to buy another FX, as well as it's head turning exterior. My '03's mileage was consistently 19-20 around town. I expect the '06 to be similar."
infiniti,fx35,2006,Teddy Turner, 03/08/2006,MY FX 35,4,The FX is fun to drive. It's an SUV but doesn't give you that top heavy feeling as if you will be blown over by a strong gust of wind. Handles very well!! 
infiniti,fx35,2006,David L, 12/17/2006,Look forward to driving on the weekends,4,"Purchased the 2006 FX and it's been a pleasure to drive. Love the growl of the exhaust, the acceleration is great and you can't beat the exterior styling. We were looking for a SUV that didn't drive and look like a box on wheels and the FX35 has easily surpassed our expectations.  Test drove the Lexus RX330, the Mazda CX7, the Volkswagen Touareg, and the Nissan Murano. The FX had the best balance of performance, price, and design.  Extremely pleased with the purchase no regrets"
infiniti,fx35,2006,S21, 09/07/2007,Pretty Good Vehicle,3,"Good power and features. Love the back up camera. Controls are very easy to use. The rear seat belts are very hard to buckle.  They are jammed down practically down into the seats.  It took my 6 year old months to be able to do it. It was even hard for me to do sometimes. Also, the a/c smells moldy. Only have 8K miles on the car. Headlights don't shine out far enough (very wide, but not far), adjusting didn't help. Not great gas mileage. Window squeaks when rolling down, complained twice already, still squeaks. Good car but not sure I'd buy again."

infiniti,fx35,2006,Type2A, 01/17/2008,30k Miles later...,2,"I wrote a review 2 years ago when I leased the car, but now after 2 years 30k miles later I've changed my tune...  The FX is purely eye candy and has no uses as an SUV. It lacks in space (trunk area is half of any other SUV & passenger leg room is minimal) and my family of 4 barely fits in the car (can't even take road trips because its so small). The snow feature sounds like a tonka truck falling down stairs when it activates. Services cost more than my BMW M3 and parts are very expensive.  If the weather gets below 32 degrees the car's performance and driver-feel becomes sub-par.  After I hit 20k miles the car started to feel like it had 80k miles. I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS CAR AGAIN!"
infiniti,fx35,2006,sidd_myster, 09/04/2007,Don't buy this car,2,"I bought an FX 35, 2006. Drove great for 6 months and then had an issue with the rack and pinion. Since then there has been a shake in the car around 60 to 70 miles. The steering wheel shakes consistently and the dealership cannot seem to fix it. I have taken it in four times and they keep saying it is normal for the car. Normal for 40K car to shake at 60 miles an hours. Very disappointed in Infiniti. Will never buy an Infiniti again."
infiniti,fx35,2006,JBM, 01/11/2018,Nice looking but with compromises,3,"Great looks, storage space, and well laid out cockpit. But behind the times connectivity, cramped (especially back seats), poor gas mileage, and definitely not on par with the quality of its competitors.

infiniti,fx35,2006,mden09, 04/02/2009,Best SUV & Sports Car Combo,4,"I used to have the Infiniti QX4 and the G35. When the FX35 released it was the best of both worlds- the power of a sports car and the room within an SUV. I have been very happy with this purchase. A lot of other brands have tried to copy its slick design, but failed in my opinion. Still the best looking cross over."
infiniti,fx35,2006,Ziggy, 02/08/2006,Awesome RX,4,"Looked at quite a few others that ""compete"" with this car. IMHO there is not another vehicle out there that compares. Quality design, looks, performance, handling and standard features are plentiful."

This is absolutely the best machine I have ever driven.  Nothing else looks like it on the road and it is a blast to drive.  Handling, comfort, tech-toys, looks - the total package!"
infiniti,fx35,2006,Michel Farag, 05/05/2006,Best Sports Utility Vehicle ever,4,"The car is much better than any other SUVs I had before or drove. I drove the old and new Ford Explorer, Cherokee and Grand Cherokee, Mitsubishi Montero, Porsche Cayenne, VW Touareg V6. I can only compare it to the Porsche Cayenne S V8 and VW Touareg V8, but these consume more gas 14/18 while my FX35 makes 17/21."

infiniti,fx35,2006,Peggy , 09/27/2006,Disappointed,4,I've owned my FX for two months now and I'm still having a difficult time getting used to the ride. The ride is very rigid and the steering wheel vibrates when hitting a bump. Maybe this car should be labeled as a sports car instead of crossover SUV.  If you're looking for a  car ride you might want to consider another vehicle.

The FX has all the power and feel of a sports car..packed into the shell of a crossover SUV.  Driving the FX does NOT feel like you're driving a truck..as it did when I test drove the Pilot, Rav4, Forrester.. Granted, the FX is in a whole different class..but I love the solid feel of this vehicle.  I got the space I needed..and the unique styling, performance, and reliability that I felt only Infiniti knew how to combine.  "
infiniti,fx35,2006,deanie, 11/11/2006,Great WAGON - just shy of Outstanding,4,"Bought it for the safety,handling, build quality and reliability & got all four.  Handles better than most vehicles on the road with the standard suspension.  Steering is quick, firm and accurate, great braking. Solid ride. Back-up camera makes parking a snap.  I advise against the sport package unless you drive only on billiard table smooth roads (and who of us does). Even the standard suspension can be harsh on bumpy roads.  We actually fit three across in the back seat (2 kid seats and my mother-in- law) on long trips.  Bose stereo is very good, and the seats are supremely comfortable.  It's a station wagon with athletic/sporty handling (it ain't no SUV) and that's a good thing!"
infiniti,fx35,2006,Paul, 11/09/2006,You need to own a gas station!!!,4,"This is a 4WD infinity fx35. You need to own a gas station to ride the car, the fuel mileage in the city is ridicules. I drive in the to the city every day and the BEST this car can do is 13.8 m/g. If you want to make 21 mi/g on the highway you need to play with the gas pedal and do not go more then 60 mi/h. It is very hard ride it is like a sports car. The location of the buttons is very uncountable to reach them. The sound system is ok, the could put a subwoofer to improve the sound. Very little room on the back seat, 2 adults hardly fit there. Trunk space very small. I lease the car so I will give it back in a year and will not take it any more."
infiniti,fx35,2006,cmcbruin, 04/09/2006,Lost my sportscar; kept my sportscar,4,"My lease end on the Audi TT Coupe Quattro, and the need for something more practical with AWD led me to an SUV.  My dissapointment with having to depart my roadster was almost forgotten with this awesome machine!  I have the AWD with Sports, Touring, and Tech package.  It is fast; desceptively so.  It is fun to drive; the kids love it.  It is truly a luxury sports sedan with the convenience of an SUV.  It still turns heads even though it has been out for 3+ years.  Now only if I can talk the wife into a Caymen S!  Dream on!"
infiniti,fx35,2006,Kristi, 08/16/2009,Great Car,4,"I am a realtor and have loved having this car to show clients in. There is plenty of room in the back seat and for people with long legs. It has a really sporty sound, and handles well. Doesn't make super tight turns though and I feel like sometimes it is hard to see over the hood because of how round it is. The other weird thing is the location of the gas level indicator. It is poorly placed and was right in the line of the steering wheel. I have ran out of gas two times since owning this car purely because I didn't see the red light go on or realize how low I was on gas. Not a lot of storage room either. But all in all, a fantastic car I would recommend."

infiniti,fx35,2006,ehanbameh, 08/28/2008,pretty good,4,"Bluetooth handsfree does not work the way it should be.  Its voice recognition system won't recognize your voice right.  It will work as a simple handsfree.  Still, mic quality is horrid.  Folding chair catches the seatbelt and won't fold the way it should be.  Vent stinks even after changing filter.  But with all that in mind, I don't find anything bad with this car.  Handling is superb compare to other suvs.  Exhaust has low growls that entertains and never annoys.  Steering stiffness is perfect as well as the ride quality.  Power is always there in wide rpm range.  In overall, it is a great buy and there's no others quite like this.  Unless you're buying a x5 of course. "
infiniti,fx35,2006,snewth, 01/08/2008,Would definitely buy again!,4,"Had the FX 35 one year now and love it.  Handling and performance like a sports car (previous car was BMW M3) with utility of SUV.  Gas mileage is 19-21 mph.  Only downside is the hard ride, which I like and part of the sport suspension, but not for some expecting soft SUV-type ride.  This is a sports car with unbelievable utility. Don't forget its great looks and comfortable front seats."
infiniti,fx35,2006,Scott Yule, 03/25/2006,Amazing,5,"This is my first SUV, and I love it.  It drives like a sports car.  I had it hooked up with the sports package, with chrome pillars and cross bars, which really makes it stand out on the road.  I wasn't sure if the 280 hp would be enough for me, but it definitely gets the job done.  The bose sound system really kicks to.  I can't say enough about this vehicle."
infiniti,fx35,2006,fxyguy, 03/27/2006,"Fx-35 - great ride, buggy bluetooth/key",4,"I love the performance and tight construction of the FX-35.  After owning it for 3 days, with the ""keyless"" entry package, A Prius with the keyless feature parked next to me and confused my FX's system.  The FX wnet into theft lockout mode and the car had to be towed to a dealer to reset the system.  This is a very bad and buggy deisign - shame on the Japanese designers!!  Toyota only ships 75 radio codes so this is a recurring problem for Toyota - not sure how many Inifniti codes there are.  Also, bluetooth phone system locks up when the call can't go through - ignition must be shut off/on to reset the bluetooth system - more bugs - factory designers need to get their act together!!"

This vehicle beats the BMW X5 all day long, you would have to spend 55K+ to get same level of performance and equipment.  The Touareg is nice but costs more money, less power (V6 model), and hoorible fuel mileage.  Infiniti hit a hoome run with the FX!"
infiniti,fx35,2006,Nick B, 06/04/2006,SUV with a heart of a sports car,5,"Every time I have to drive somewhere I get a big grin on my face. This car is way too much fun to drive. I love the shape and the looks of the car. I haven't had it for a long period of time but my friend has an '03 and the FX is unique. There are some annoyances like layout of the console buttons and functionality of some of the features but all cars have some sort of a fault in them. Overall, I'm very happy with the FX."

There has not been a single problem after some 7,000 miles. The car handles like a charm. The engine is more powerful than, but not as smooth as, my bimmer's. Many readers did not give this car a perfect 10 because of its fuel mileage. I did give it a 10 since the fuel mileage I have got is equal or better than the one advertised by Infiniti, so no surprise there. Otherwise, no one should give a perfect mark to any SUVs, simply because of their fuel mileage.  "

One review I read coined it the ""Bionic Cheetah"", they couldn't have picked a more appropriate title.  This SUV is the definitely part sports car, part SUV.  It is not just fun to drive, but a thrill to drive.  I added the Sport, Touring, and Technology package, which brought it out of the ordinary to the extraordinary.   I highly recommend the FX35 (Bionic Cheetah) to anyone looking to break out of the ho-hum SUV mold.  "

Can't fit anything into those two, and imagine the insurance!  Buy one of these now, because I don't see how it's possible to improve, especially the styling.  Drove previous lease in heavy snow conditions, pereformed like a champ-- mucho traction.  Also am a original owner of a 1996 z3 (before they ruined the styling)-- never thought I could love a car more than that one, but this one I do."

Now, after 1000 miles, I can drive with more enthusiasm. I love this car! Once you see it with the sport package (20"" wheels, blacked out lights)you have to have it. Throttle tip in is good, love the exhaust sound, love the stance, HID lights, LED tails, high door sills. Only problem is, my wife likes to drive it too. I'm not a jealous person, but that's MY car! 265mm tires and AWD, this car seriously handles like a sports car. No joke."

Ride, styling, handling,I think the FX is better. But, some features and comforts, the Infiniti is not as good as what should be it's lesser sibling.  The back seat is much smaller and less roomy.   For the driver comforts - the window controls are poorly placed, the HVAC controls are not as easy to use as the Murano, and there are none of the great storage compartments of the Nissan.  Two real disappointments: a fresh air vent that routes through the engine compartment in a way that blows hot air regardless of outside temp, and a built in bluetooth handsfree phone microphone that is horrible-all callers complain!"

The V6 feels like a V8.  The ride and performance is awesome (I have the Sport package).  I absolutely love the seats and Bluetooth (Handsfree package).  My only grip is the dashboard cannot be dimmed without the lights being on- I was really digging for this one.  The warranty is also the best in the luxury segment.  I love this vehicle.  The German comparable is at least $10K more and not worth it.  Goodbye BMW!
infiniti,fx35,2006,Phil Mc kenna, 01/09/2007,SUV with vroom,4,This vehicle is a real surprise. The utility of a suv with the speed and grace of a sport coupe.   The price beats all other vehicles in this segment ( bmw x3 ). You can't beat the bang for the buck.

At first I didn't think it was worth the money considering the rear passenger leg room is sparse, it has the least amount of cargo room in its class, I had to buy a roof rack for our snow boards, its difficult getting our small kids in and out of the rear, and there is A LOT of plastic in the interior. But 15k miles later I love the way it handles (just like a V8), great exhaust note, and superb handling (easy transition to go from my M to this car).  As it compares to other SUVs in terms of practicality it isn't a smart choice, but its the best for overall performance and incredible aesthetics."

I have had no issues and I don't see the issues people are having with the bluetooth.  Both my wife's and my phones work very well.  I can't believe the power and comfort of this vehicle.  Gas is great. If I wanted better then 23 I would have bought a different car.  Yes I feel the road some but that is the sports car in it.  WOW!"

Interior and exterior design and quality beats anything else we have seen. We have three kids and can fit three child/booster seats in the back. Cargo space was much larger than expected!! It is wider than the competition and the FX is more practical to load. Great combination of design and performance. With AWD and the powerfull engine, gas mileage (16-21 mpg) is a bit low. It drives like a sport car but is still extremely comfortable. Most other SUVs feel like trucks but not this one. Great control on the road. "

infiniti,fx35,2007,kyle mack, 07/07/2008,Great CUV,4,"I looked at the larger GMC crossovers, Arcadia, Enclave, Outlook and although the cargo room in these vehicles was impressive I just didn't like the jerky transmission. Since I didn't need a large crossover the FX35 was a good choice. The vehicle is very quick and sporty and the transmission and auto shifting is outstanding. Even with 4 adults and luggage for a long weekend I am getting 20  miles per gallon. Great looking vehicle and a great ride. "
infiniti,fx35,2007,VegasRPh, 12/29/2009,One of the BEST SUV's out there!,5,"My wife and I leased a 2007 Infiniti FX35 (RWD) with Sport Pkg (20"" wheels) hands free pkg (bluetooth) in Graphite Metallic Paint with Brick (orange) leather interior. The MSRP on the FX35 was $43,000 and we got a fantastic lease deal for 39 months on it. In my honest opinion, this has been one of the BEST vehicles we have ever owned over the last 35 months (4 months to go on the lease)! My wife does NOT want to give the FX35 back. She says everyday, she looks forward to driving it. The FX35 has NEVER been in the shop, runs/drives like new to this day. Even with the 20""wheel/tires the ride is sporty, but not harsh. MPG is usually right at 19 (mix) and 25hwy. Great SUV!"
infiniti,fx35,2007,MPollmueller, 01/18/2007,sport instead of practicality,3,"I bought a new AWD FX35 in Sept.06. Fun to drive, but interior amenities far from bing as practical as my previous Honda Pilot. Gas mileage is surprisingly poor as transmission always seems to be hunting rather than engaging upon throttle changes. I'm also worried about integrity as mileage accrues. I drove a G35 with 20,000 miles while my FX was in the shop and it felt like it had 100,000 miles on it. This truck handles like a sports sedan, gets admiring looks, but sometimes feels like more flash than substance."
infiniti,fx35,2007,gsuroviec, 12/10/2012,"Good looking, but not practical.",3,"Never owned a crossover until now.
Test drove practically every SUV and crossover before deciding to go with the 2007 FX35 AWD with Sport package.
Regretting it now.
Love the looks, inside and out.
But, rides very stiff and only about 15-16mpg regardless of grade of gas and type of driving.
Needs a 6 or 7 speed tranny. Hard to get in and out of back seat.
And, very noisy exhaust system.
Wishing now I got the Edge or MKX instead for the ride, power and MPG.
Even GM's Terrain and Equinox rode quieter and smoother than this FX35.
But, it sure is a pretty vehicle. "
infiniti,fx35,2007,nissanfan4lyfe, 07/08/2011,Amazing,4,"Never owned an SUV/CUV and wanted something that still gave me the fun to drive factor (I've owned Maxima's, a Spec V/SE-R's, a G20, I35 and Protege5), while providing the room I needed for me & my dog & the FX is just that. It's sporty, luxurious, reliable, safe & grown up with great curb appeal. Great power from the VQ V6, alot of features and I couldn't be happier."
infiniti,fx35,2007,Endophil, 01/30/2007,It's a Winner,4,"This is my third Infiniti. Was looking for a change so I test drove the RX350. They are both great cars,but totally different. If you want straight out luxury with no feel of the road the RX is for you.If you want to feel like you are driving get the FX. You either like or hate the looks. Its that simple. The ride,handling and feel are superior to any crossover out there. From past experience the reliability should be great. There is a distinct growl to the engine which is invigorating to a driver. If you need real quiet look elsewhere. I know from my past SUVs that gas mileage won't be the best, but if that concerns you don't get an SUV/Crossover. Would do it again."
infiniti,fx35,2007,Jeff, 01/28/2007,Like a sports car that can do HomeDepot,5,"Just purchased an 07FX35 and have to say coming from an 03 Explorer what a difference. On the road looks/drives sporty/quiet. Very sports sedan like(was thinking of getting into an AcuraTL or Infiniti G but being 6'3"" and accustomed to the higher entry of the SUV went with the FX, happy!  The interior is very nice. Cup holders where they should be and love the new design change from the 05.I have 1500 miles on it in mixed driving and so far average mpg is 21.  I get very good highway millage 25-ish with the cruise on at 75.Around town 18 mpg (I have a heavy foot) The explorer has more space in the rear. But with the easy fold down seats Home depot is no problem.Also 4 buds and clubs fit nice"
infiniti,fx35,2007,tolax, 05/10/2007,"Fun, Fun, Fun",4,Very impressed so far. Compared it with the Lexus RX 350 and the FX was so much more fun to drive. Also seems just about everyone has an RX 350 these days so I wanted something different.  The interior is very well laid out and feels classy. The analog clock for example is a nice touch. 
infiniti,fx35,2007,Mike Marshall, 02/17/2019,Was hoping for better Japanese quality,2,"Bought 2007 FX35 for 19 yr old daughter in 2016 with 111,000 miles on it, nice clean S. Calif car in mint shape loaded with Bose and sports package. Love the looks of this car (it's the bronze color with black int) Handles very well. Brakes are too sensitive. Powerful but terrible gas mileage at 14. She mainly drives city and a lead foot so low MPG, was hoping for higher. Had a few problems that i was hoping NOT to have by finally buying a Japanese car but now realize, not any better quality than the previous American cars. Radiator out this week with 135K miles on it. Rear window switches just went out. Throttle body just replaced. Fuel pump needs replacement now.  ***** very disappointed with low quality vinyl seating surrounding the leather surfaces and many ""pulls/tears"" happening (same thing in brothers 2007 G35) CHEAP vinyl which is frustrating.  So, it looks really nice, powerful, handles great but quality is not what I was expecting from Japan+in this price range. 4 Infiniti's in family but I would not buy another one, not very reliable with many repairs, even on my 2008 QX56. Brother's 2007 G35 uses a ton of oil for now known reason.  I'm an old car nut, my experience has taught me if you want Japanese quality stick with a Honda or Toyota.
"
infiniti,fx35,2007,Willy G., 08/07/2009,Overall this crossover stinks,3,Gas mileage is horrible. Shimmy at 60- 65 on balanced aligned tires. Horrible gas mileage. Brakes wear relatively fast and rotors warp as fast. Poor gas mileage. Doors do not lock when vehicle starts moving for safety. Not a very quiet ride. Navigation stinks. Very expensive to maintain (very!). Could ride smoother. Did I mention HORRIBLE gas mileage?  
infiniti,fx35,2007,Rob Johnson, 10/10/2007,FX35 is awesome!,4,"This is my second Infiniti.  I was thoroughly pleased with my G35, but have to say the FX35 has exceeded my expectations.  I will continue to purchase Infiniti mainly because of the excellent styling and reliability I have found in both vehicles.  The look and styling of the FX35 is in a class of it's own.  I had compared it to several other makes and models but again Infiniti came out well ahead for more bang for the buck.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone that truly has an appreciation for driving a well built vehicle."
infiniti,fx35,2007,Sonlee, 09/19/2017,Love the Grrrowlll,5,"Love the way it handles like a sports car & has that sports car growl. Driving has been a joy. I'm a firm believer in keeping up with my regular maintenance & have not had any major problems with this vehicle. I plan to drive this until it just totally dies. My 2007 looks like new.

infiniti,fx35,2007,Crs, 10/23/2017,Not good in idaho,2,"So the suv has a snow mode and i was told by the Nissan dealer that this suv would be great in all conditions well not true at all in the winter it stays parked becuse i cant affored any more tow fees there was 3 inches of snow and i got stuck and could not move but keep in mind i have the same tires on my 2wd truck also my drive way will get a little muddy in the spring yet again I get stuck it is way under powered for its size and prity much all of my leather has pealed off the seats. I am almost done paying it off i got it for 22000 and have had nothing but issues also the head lights i have had everything replaced that has to do with the head lights and they will just stop working and if I give it a few days or so they will work again but it is very upsetting going 80 down the high way and all of a sudden not having headlights will all the issues I have had with the car it has been taken to several shops including Nissan dealrers that have specalits in infinity and they tell me Thats just the way the suv is there for i will never buy a nuther infinity or recommend one to anyone

infiniti,fx35,2007,John Vaughn, 07/30/2007,Reliability Problems,3,"Purchased what I thought would be a wonderful and reliable vehicle but had problems from day one.  The major issue continued to be steering wheel vibrations.  Infiniti replaced the steering rack and associated linkage to no avail.  Car shook around 65 mph and continued at higher speeds.  Replaced the tires, etc., still no relief.  Got to the point I couldn't stand the shaking anymore so I traded it on an 07 MDX.  I also had a lot of rattles in the FX."
infiniti,fx35,2007,redd14, 09/07/2014,seats,3,"In 2009, I purchased a 2007 Infiniti FX35 with the understanding that I was getting leather seats. The sells paper says leather. When I google the vehicle, it says leather. In 2011, the seats had to be repaired. Now in 2014, the seats have to be repaired again. I have contacted an attorney and consumer affairs about this false advertisement. The cars with no leather sell for 12,000. I paid over 29,000 for my car, with the understanding that I was getting leather seats. I contacted Infiniti, and they forwarded my email to consumer affairs. If you purchased the vehicle, and the sells paper said leather seats, you should join me in this lawsuit. I am waiting for an attorney to contact me. "
infiniti,fx35,2007,Gee Bee, 12/21/2007,Riding like the law in my new FX35,4,"I purchased my new Autumn Copper FX35 in March, 2007. It has exceeded all of my expectations regarding performance, styling and ergonnomics. It has all the options except the rear entertainment system and run-flat tires. The engine is smooth and torquey, my gas mileage in Houston's freeway traffic has averaged 21.8 mpg, surprisingly. I love the Autumn Copper color for this vehicle. It seems to bring out all the lines and compound curves this vehicle has to offer. The aggressive styling sets it apart from any other vehicle on the road and the 20"" wheels add a sport stance that looks better than the standard 18"" wheels. I don't carry a lot of things, interior size is good."
infiniti,fx35,2007,Vincent, 04/29/2009,Had to do it again!,4,"The lease on my 05 FX was up. I loved it, but just wanted a change. I drove A LOT of cars... Had experience in BMW 530xi, X5, Porsche Cayenne S, Range Rover, Touareg, MDX, RDX. Previously owned 2 Lexus RX300's and a couple Explorers. When it came down to it, there wasn't anything else out there that (IMO) topped the FX35.  The FX just sticks to the ground. You don't turn a corner, you THINK the car around the corner. Steering is tight and 6cyl engine is powerful.  Can't imagine why anyone would want a FX45?  A little heavy on gas. Though premium is recommended, no problem on regular. The FX does have a huge blind spot. My 05 was tough learning to back up, but the rear camera is a dream."
infiniti,fx35,2007,gtw2, 09/16/2009,Love this vehicle...mostly,4,"We've had 0 mechanical issues; great performance in spirited driving. The trim around the windows has started to fade after 2 years & the vinyl part of the seat (the sides) are starting to crack on both front seats. The wheels are also discoloring; dealer says its something we applied (the car wash I've used for 10 years changed their products all of a sudden? really?!!!) So other than those minor & annoying issues, this is a fantastic vehicle. I am concerned w/ long-term build quality. Our brand- new looking 97 Toyota Land Cruiser was chiseled out of granite, so not sure Ive got a balanced view (you should only return to the dealer for breaks, oil & to buy a new one after 300k miles)."
infiniti,fx35,2007,Mike, 12/14/2009,The Differentiator,4,"I've been very impressed with my FX.  I bought it with 19100 miles.  It drove a little erratic but that was due to the Goodyear Eagle RS-As which were replaced within a month.  Those tires were terrible; I replaced them with Yokohama Paradas and it is a totally different drive.  Love the sound, the handling, the experience.  Not for everyone as it is really suited for four.  Overall, love it as it is the best of all worlds."
infiniti,fx35,2007,VegasRPh, 03/09/2007,FX35 puts the SPORT in SUV,4,"My wife and I leased a 2007 FX35 RWD with Touring/Sport/Hands-Free Pkgs. We were able to get this vehicle for $100 over invoice with some haggling. After driving Lexus RX, Porsche Cayenne, MB ML350, BMW X3, Volvo XC90 and GMC Acadia we knew this was the vehicle for us. The sweet sounding V6 exhaust note and performance are better than all above mentioned SUVs. We have Diamond Graphite + Brick (red/orange) interior and it looks AWESOME! Gas mileage has been 18 mpg city/22 mpg HWY, BUT it only has 600 miles on it! Rear back up camera is very useful and so is the Bluetooth phone capability. Rear toe space is a little tight, but on par with other Suvs mentioned above. Overall, we LOVE THIS FX35!!"
infiniti,fx35,2007,DCIN8, 03/22/2007,WOW!,5,"I have just moved up from an 04 G35 coupe, to an 07 FX35 AWD White on Wheat with hands free, and touring Package. I have owned it for 4 days now and, All I can say is that I love this SUV. It is the most comfortable ride I have ever had.  It has 275 horses and rides as good as my G. Gas mileage is around 17 city with the air on constantly, in South Florida.  Much better than previous SUVs.  Unless you have a hybrid how can you possibly expect more mileage at this performance level. I may not give this back when the lease is done."
infiniti,fx35,2007,SandMan, 03/22/2007,Better then my BMW,4,"Traded my 06 BMW 3 series for this SUV. Other then minor fixes (some cuts/slits in leather seats which were immediately replaced by dealership), this car has performed well.  Averaging 21-22 MPG around town to my delight!  Test drove Lexus RX350; but, did not like the body style.  Love the look & drive of the FX35."
infiniti,fx35,2007,Andrew, 03/19/2007,Great car and a blast to drive,4,"I have been driving my 2007 FX35 for 1 month and it is the best car I have owned.  The acceleration and handling are very good for its size and weight, and the car draws admiring glances for its design and color (Autumn Copper). The seats are remarkably comfortable, and the equipment level is high.  Fuel economy is around 16 mpg city, 21 highway according to the trip computer."
infiniti,fx35,2007,Lester, 03/25/2007,Solid and mildly inspiring,3,"Despite the reviews of fast acceleration, the 6 cylinder works hard and loudly to move this car - but you have to really step on the pedal for it to move.  That acceleration rush costs greatly in fuel economy.  The driving position for me is less than ideal as are the seats.  The Bose system is OK.  The FX35 feels rock solid, but quite honestly, I expected more.  My leased vehicle has every option including the massive wheels.  It ranks a solid B."
infiniti,fx35,2007,smaynard, 04/08/2007,Not happy,3,"Just leased an 07 FX35. Very disappointed. Has been in for service twice for the gps, works now but not very well. I am still using my old portable because it works sooo much better. The bluetooth will not sync with my blackberry, check engine light come on every once in a while, cruise control only works about 70% of the time. All of this with less that 2000 miles."
infiniti,fx35,2007,Patrick, 04/22/2007,Fantastic Ride!,4,"We bought the FX 35 about three weeks ago.  Moving from a Jeep Grand Cherokee, which we thought handled sort of like a car, is like moving from a bicycle to a Harley.  The FX is nimble, sporty and quick.  You can really feel the road yet the seats are super comfortable.  The interior is nicely appointed and the steering wheel controls are great. My wife has a hard time seeing out of the GC and she loves the way this car drives.  We are very pleased. "
infiniti,fx35,2007,H&B, 05/16/2007,Very pleased,4,I've always been a Toyota fan and have owned 4Runners since 1988. But I just do not like the look of the new 4Runner. I drove just about everything out there and had my mind made up on a Lexus until I drove the FX. It's as much fun as driving my '93 Supra! Got exactly what we were looking for. Having some trouble getting my phone to work properly with the bluetooth but then my phone is not listed as one that's compatible. My wife's phone works fine.
infiniti,fx35,2007,Cargasm51, 05/14/2007,Awesome FX,4,This vehicle is everything and then some. I smile upon approaching my FX and the smile last until I park it and walk away. I love my FX!
infiniti,fx35,2007,Johnny Walker, 07/18/2007,Finally,5,"I am extremely happy with my FX35 and could not imagine driving another car or SUV period.  I love the fact that I can take it anywhere or do anything and look good doing it.  The woods to go camping one day, and to a show in town the next, I have found the perfect car for me.  "
infiniti,fx35,2007,Les, 08/29/2007,What A Machine,5,Excellent vehicle! Both sporty and fun to drive. Very well made and a surprisingly quiet ride. Just the right size for a family of 4. 
infiniti,fx35,2007,Tranced25, 09/01/2007,Great Car,4,"I was wary upgrading from my 2006 G35 coupe. The coupe with 15k miles felt like it had 80k on the odometer.  The FX is fantastic.  I missed an SUV, and this car feels just like a (brand-new) heavier G35.  It even handles better IMO.  Whereas my coupe lost its composure over anything but the smoothest roads, the FX retains it on rough pavement.  The sport package is a must-have for its looks alone.  Not much to differentiate it from an FX45 except the chrome surrounding the side windows on the 45.  Although to me the ride feels smooth coming from a sport packaged G35, others may find it harsh with the sport package.  I can easily tear up an exit ramp in this car, no complaints!"
infiniti,fx35,2007,Larry M., 05/29/2007,Love this car!,4,"It's a wonderful driver's car, giving me SUV convenience with sports car performance. Visibility took some getting used to, but this car in the snow is my favorite new sport; I go out looking for unplowed hills. I'd like larger side mirrors and more luxury (wood) in the trim, but all else works for me. Love the analog clock like the Maserati."
infiniti,fx35,2007,DavidG, 07/08/2007,"Fun, fast, and looks great!",4,"This is a great mid-size SUV that drives like a car. We test drove the BMW X5 and Range Rover HSE Sport in comparison to the FX35. The FX35 with the Sport, Touring, and Tech Package had better performance, comfort, and amenities than the rest. It is by far quicker and more responsive than the BMW or the Range Rover.  For 15-20K less the FX35 is a great value as well."
infiniti,fx35,2007,mitchell rowe, 06/10/2007,A perfect 10,5,"The FX35 has all the modern safety and convenience features to stay safe on today's highway. Plenty of room, tremendous bose satellite radio, extremely comfortable driver's seat."
infiniti,fx35,2007,Michael M., 07/22/2007,Excellent Vehicle,5,"Just leased the FX35 and so far I really enjoy driving this vehicle. Can't call it a car or an SUV, it is truly a crossover. A lot more sport than utility. Has some areas where there is obvious form over function (e.g. analog clock and steering wheel controls). The clock is cool, but there's a digital one in the display so it isn't functional. The steering wheel controls are not ergonomically placed for operation while driving; I've adapted. The ride can be harsh on rough pavement, more so with the sport package, but the FX handles the bumps with confidence and grace. It stays planted on the road. Missing some important safety features like DRL, auto locks, cargo cover, mirror side markers."
infiniti,fx35,2007,Pleased in Fresno, 05/15/2008,Pure Comfort and Luxury,4,"I admired this luxury vehicle for three years prior to purchase.  I would test drive the FX35 periodically in hopes of one day becoming an owner.  In June 2007, I purchased my brand new vehicle and I have enjoyed driving it.  I never really  liked driving until I purchased this vehicle."
infiniti,fx35,2007,K J B, 06/25/2020,"First time owning SPORTY, and I was sold.",5,"This vehicle has the Juice. Wish it came with an auxiliary connection at least, but there is ways around to upgrade your entertainment. I’m a single man standing 6’1” that provides me with spacious seating position. It’s high enough to jump in and out just like any other SUV and it’s very easy on my back. It’s a firm feel to it which I like. And it’s a gem you hardly see on the road; I enjoy being different from the rest. And I’m not spending a lot for a vehicle either. I was told that the car has another motor installed but at 170,k + miles, I’m not complaining at all. 
"
infiniti,fx35,2008,sean, 12/28/2009,It handles like a sports car,4,"The reviews are correct: the FX35 handles like a sports sedan, but with a higher seating position and extra room.  The ride is firm, but comfortable.  You feel some bumps, but it's not harsh.  (I did not have the sport package.)  AWD, snow mode, and ground clearance meant that I plowed easily through a foot or more of snow.  Great in foul weather. You could sleep a night in the seats - super comfortable.  Very zippy engine, with a very nice sounding growl.  Just a sweet vehicle (I drove it new during a 2 yr lease)."
infiniti,fx35,2008,Patrice Boron, 04/01/2009,I love my Infiniti FX35!,4,I admire the unique styling on the FX35 it feels like you are driving a sports car with the space of a CUV. This vehicle has been very fun to drive and responsive when power is needed.

We use this vehicle as a daily driver as well as for vacations out of state, as it gets 24mpg Hwy vs 18mpg in our Land Rover. It has some of the quality that Nissan is known for; however, it is pricier to maintaine. Surprisingly, I have had a wheel bearing fail, multiple recalls/warranty repairs & two break jobs all within 50 thousand miles. My wife enjoys driving this vehicle, but I am not sure if I will keep it once the warranty expires. "

I loved the shape and appearance of the car, it's a strong sharp looking car. We test drove the Nissan Murano, but the feel was different than the FX, I like the fact that the FX iss a rear wheel drive. Now... I drive the car every day & my husband drives the 2nd car."
infiniti,fx35,2008,Bud, 09/23/2008,Love it,4,"I've been thinking about a FX-35 for 5 years.  I always thought that the mileage would be too poor for me to consider.  Love a sporty driver that is practical - which defines an FX.  Wanted something bigger than my 07 VW-GTI.  Drove the BMW X6- nice but small, heavy, overpriced and lacks the fun to drive factor Love the FXs comfort, size, quality, sporty drive, high end finishes, feel of the wheel and those seats.  Big side mirrors enhance side visibility - with backup camera, I can park easily.  Haven't been this thrilled with a car since I bought my 92 Legend couple new.  If you don't put your foot into it, you can do OK with gas consumption"
infiniti,fx35,2008,Seattle Steve, 11/05/2010,Almost Perfect,4,"Moved from a BMW 5-series wagon; wanted AWD, fun to drive, utility, and reliability.  FX35 meets all criteria: engine is very strong, handling is great, interior is roomy and comfortable, and the back has plenty of room for anyone except those with large families.  Appreciate the small touches such as puddle lights, interior storage,  and rear view camera.  Averaging 20 mpg in mixed city / hwy driving.  Size and performance is very similar to a Porsche Cayenne, but at a much lower price. Engine has a distinctive growl that's very enjoyable in spirited driving, but can be a distraction at times. Purchased used with 25k miles, have driven 5k miles now with no issues.  No regrets leaving BMW."
infiniti,fx35,2008,Cube, 10/30/2008,New to Infinity,4,"I bought this car yesterday late afternoon in Houston and drove it home 350 miles immediately there after. We own a BMW 325 I which is my wife's car. I wanted an X5. I can tell you after this drive that I regret nothing!!! This is a supreme and finely balanced machine and is not even the top of the line. The sound system is second to none and kept me entertained the whole route. I checked out a MDX, Acadia, X5, X3 and this puppy is a breed above. The local dealer test drive doesn't tell you the whole story. Wow!!"
infiniti,fx35,2008,schnellerkerl, 04/10/2012,A great step up,5,"Traded in my 328XI Sportwagon - Wife just wanted something bigger. And While I never had a problem with my wagon - BMWs are just too non-user friendly. What no dip Stick? - Come-on...
Besides the FX looks better than an X5 or X3. Lots cheaper.

Had a 1991 Q45 and it was a blast - so I thought the FX might work - And I was not disappointed.

Great car one I worked out the APPLE-bluetooth issues and the IPOD connection that was never mentioned in the manual.

Now I am working on a slight shimmy that seems to be indicative of the 2008 FX. But its not enough to keep m from enjoying the car. I'm just a little OCD about my vehicles."
infiniti,fx35,2008,Tom, 03/06/2008,Love this car,5,"I'm 33 and I bought this car this summer have 12k driven already loaded with 20"" rims every option.   I beat on this car and its handling is great, just like a sports car, my customers and friends love the truck.  Back seat very comfortable. I like the heavy weight and agility, suspension, sound of the exhaust.  The roof rack helped with adding a snow board rack.    I will lease this same car when my lease is up in 21 months and thinking of giving up my porsche boxster."
infiniti,fx35,2008,JB, 08/09/2008,Everything I expected and more,4,"The Infiniti FX35 combines the performance of a high performance sports car and the versatility of an SUV.

infiniti,fx35,2008,Akhan, 03/25/2009,Sport Sedan In The Shell of An SUV,4,"Recently purchased the FX35 2008 after repeatedly admiring it's aggressive exterior on the road time and again. The car is everything it's penned to be. The equivalent of a G35 with an SUV exterior. Acceleration is responsive and immediate, addition of iPod connectivity is nice (although not perfect). The luxury features are impressive (bluetooth, NAV, XM satellite radio). Gas mileage is a little weak (I'm averaging in the high teens/low 20's), but that is somewhat expected with the V6 275 HP. The BOSE sound system is fun to listen to, and all-in-all, I am quite satisfied with the FX. A definite recommend!"

Handling is super though could use a little more HP the 270HP is adequate.  Recentlt on a snowy, slippery day I engaged the snow ( full time AWD button) & was very pleased. Did not spin out or slide once. Cabin is comfortable. I am overall very happy with the FX35 "
infiniti,fx35,2008,guitarist, 04/19/2008,Very Pleased,4,"t's the nicest looking SUV out there, it's a blast to drive, and even the bare bones model comes with everything I need. The interior is wonderfully simple, the seats are very comfortable, the stereo is loud, and the engine really sounds sweet. It does accept regular fuel, a lot of it, but performance seems to be a bit better using the recommended premium. Acceleration is smooth and reasonably brisk, and steering is firm and sporty. I think it's a great value for the money."
infiniti,fx35,2008,fxlouky, 05/11/2008,Sweet,4,"One month in. No complaints. Everything it is built to be. Handling is heavy and stiff yet nimble. Great ride with spot package. Turns on a dime with decent radius. Great 30-60 pickup. As noted, it is thirsty, but know what you're buying. This isn't a Prius. Interior is sharp and sophisticated. It really only compares to MDX, CX7, LR2 and Lexus RX. And there is stand apart. Car should still look great 10 years from now. Well ahead of its time."
infiniti,fx35,2008,Charles, 12/05/2008,They put the SPORT in Sport Utility,5,"Over the years I've owned a wide variety of cars including Porsches, BMWs, a 350Z, and a G35. I must admit that I was concerned that the FX was all show. It looked too sporty to be a true performer. I finally test drove one after a disappointing test drive in the Lexus RX350. I was immediately impressed. The vehicle has the tight and substantial feel very similar to the Porsche. The front fenders even have the same sloping bulge as viewed from the drivers seat. You truly have the feeling that you are in a serious performer, and it doesn't disappoint on the road. If you like driving excitement, this one delivers. Again, I've owned many performance vehicles and the FX holds its own among them."
infiniti,fx35,2008,RickF, 10/14/2009,My 4th infiniti,4,"Started with an I30 then a 2005 G35x then 2008 G35x, now the FX35. Handles much like the G35's and not really much difference in gas mileage. Love the look, the feel and handling. You do get used to the limited rear visibility, really you do. It corners and accelerates well. Very comfortable at all speeds. "
infiniti,fx35,2008,BobFX35, 01/26/2008,Impressive all the way,4,"Was in the market for a new car and I was contemplating between BMW, Lexus, Audi and Infiniti. I am glad with my decision after driving FX35, just a bit bad in the economy department. Hurts when I'm filling up the tank but the moment I start to drive its all good, puts a smile on my face everytime I pull away from others and it's real head turner. Technically it's good in almost every department."
infiniti,fx35,2008,Fletch, 08/12/2007,Sports Car in SUV Clothing,4,"My wife and I have always preferred sporty vehicles so up until now have resisted purchasing a SUV.  The FX is a great blend of a sports car feel with  SUV convenience.  Handles great in mts.  Some reviews complain about the limited storage space but we find it more than adequate for most applications.  Some don't like the exhaust sound which we enjoy but if it bothers you, simply turn up the fabulous Bose sound system.  We were concerned about possible gas mileage issues but are getting almost 24 mpg on highway and close to 20 mpg in town. Over years we have owned a lot of vehicles but we feel the FX35 is the best vehicle we have ever owned.  Goodbye Mercedes.   "
infiniti,fx35,2008,G2, 03/13/2009,Superior to everything,4,"I've admired this car for years and finally bought one.  Now I wish I had bought it years earlier.  I have a 2008 with everything except DVD (No Kids).  When I am on the road and in traffic I feel superior to everything including the Range Rover Sport and BMW X5.  The only other car that I have driven that is even close to ""fun"" performance is the BMW X5 4.8, even then BMW just has power and cost substantially more.  The Infiniti has a sports car feel.  I'm still amazed today at how much it feels like a car rather than SUV.   When you buy the car, don't settle for standard, get the full package! "
infiniti,fx35,2008,Bob Hajek, 01/23/2008,Best Deal on a Luxury Crossover,4,The FX35 has everything you could ever want standard.  It really does give you the feeling of driving a sports car.  There are only 5 FXs in our town (each a different color) - makes you feel very exclusive.  I keep getting comments from strangers about how sharp looking it is and this is a 5 year old body style! I'm very happy I decided to drive 90 miles.  
infiniti,fx35,2008,JackieF, 09/05/2009,Complete Satisfaction,4,"This vehicle has lived up to our expectations. The car continues to be a treat to drive, to look at and own. A year later, and I still enjoy looking at it and seeing other FXs on the road. It has a very solid ride, and is surprisingly responsive. We love every detail and the vehicle in general. We are sold on the Infiniti line!"
infiniti,fx35,2008,Disappointed, 05/14/2008,Too much tech,4,"With 8500 miles the FX looks like a keeper even though some of the techy stuff is frustrating. If the cruise is on and you are in a bend it will pick up cars in other lanes and stomp the brakes for you so you really have to watch where you have the cruise on. Bluetooth phone is garbage. Also the black chrome grill is all peeling off and Infiniti says they will change it once as ""good faith"" but it's my fault and not a supplier defect."
infiniti,fx35,2008,Don, 01/21/2010,"2008 FX35 AWD, Useless AWD",4,"Recently purchased a used, almost new FX35 AWD and unfortunately I should have done more research on the AWD system. The car features are fine and comparable to my X5, great stereo, etc.  Power is great and a fun drive but in snow you can not make almost any turn at any speed.  Just replaced the tires with brand new very good all seasons with great snow traction rating but the AWD system is simply useless.  Many electronic AWD vehicles when switching to Snow or 4x4 mode lock the front transmission.  FX35 simply lowers the low end power and I guess makes the system engage at lower levels.  Driving this car on snow is simply a scary ride and nothing like my X5, stay out of snow."
infiniti,fx35,2008,Jules, 01/23/2009,Not as Great as I thought,4,"I loved this great looking vehicle on the road! Loved it, loved it, loved it! Until I purchased it! I was very disappointed the very first day! I could feel every tiny bump on the road, the steering wheel is very tight, therefore it's not very easy to maneuver. I also couldn't adjust the seat into a comfortable position, and was suffering from the back pain until I got used to it. I am 5,6"" and I guess this car is not for shorties. Moms, beware! The metal anchors are so deep, it took me about 20 minutes to install the car seat! Right now I got used to the car, love all other features:  Bluetooth, tech pack, back-up camera and keyless entry, but will be looking for another one soon. "
infiniti,fx35,2008,Dizzy, 03/06/2010,Dizzy,4,In this car you can feel every single bump in the road. That was something to get used too. 
infiniti,fx35,2008,alpz, 01/23/2009,Bad Cam after 3 months of purchase,2,"I purchase on 9/08 a FX 35 with 42 miles. Three months later the check engine light turns on and has problems starting, the mileage at this time was 4800 miles. After 2 weeks at the dealer they told that the camshaft went out.  Very dissatisfied with this Infiniti. "
infiniti,fx35,2008,Liv, 08/25/2008,One month review,4,"Have had this vehicle for a month now and love the look of it, love the way it drives, and love the respect I get on the road. I was most worried about the visibility b/c I read the vehicle has a lot of blind spots, turns out the mirrors are pretty good about compensating. My one main issue is a personal one - I am 5'5"" and having a hard time getting the right fit in the vehicle - I end up with knees dangerously close to dash in order to reach the pedals and  see well through the windshield at the same time. If I move the seat lower, the seatbelt is on my neck, if I move it farther back, I can't reach the gas pedal as well. I think it would be hard to find a good comfort level for shorties."
infiniti,fx35,2008,Carnut from NC, 12/21/2007,A lot of Luxury/Sport SUV for the Money!,4,"I'm a confessed carnut and I think this is a great SUV. I've had a Porsche Cayenne S, BMW X5 and Lincoln SUVs prior and I think that this one is the most comfortable and certainly the best value for the dollar. I traded in a BMW 745i and as great as that car was, there is a lot to love about this car! Sporty, fun to drive, logical controls, very comfortable seats (I'm 6'5 and that is always a concern), and usable options instead of gadgets just to have gadgets! I would say luxurious as well. I got the sport package and did not notice the ride vs the non sport which I test drove as well. The 20"" wheels/tires look awesome as well as the other sport trim items that are part of the package."
infiniti,fx35,2008,DeoMac, 09/27/2008,The Principal,4,I LOVE the FX. It is so much fun to drive and I always get compliments about its appearance. Just the right blend of luxury and sport.
infiniti,fx35,2008,Charger Fan, 10/09/2008,No Comparison!,4,"Love this FX35! This replaced the Volvo XC90 as I have safety, stored the Carrera as I have the power, performance and fun, gave the MDX to hubby, as I have the comfort, style and loaded features all in one car!! Handles like a dream, very comfy, beautiful as all get out! Love all the bells and whistles moreover the price.. not bad. Wish MPG was better however I won't compromise its performance. I wish I can keep this car a secret but people are catching on! This is the sports package of a BMW M for SUVs with the safety rep of a Volvo for us soccer moms! "
infiniti,fx35,2008,Don, 11/16/2008,Second FX35,5,"I am in my second FX35 and really enjoy driving my 2008 model. My first FX 35 was a 2005 model with sport and touring packages. I found this to be the most comfortable, fun, and stylish car I've ever had and I've owned several luxury and sports cars. I test drove many crossovers and SUVs and felt the most comfortable being a big guy when I climbed back into my 2005 FX 35. If you want a stylish and fun car to drive check out the FX35."
infiniti,fx35,2008,katec, 01/03/2008,Went from BMW 330 Convertible to FX35,4,"I needed more room and had to give up the convertible.  I was really surprised when I test-drove this car and fell in love with it.  The FX35 has a great sporty look.  It handles as well as my 2005 BMW 330 CiC (with sport pkg).  I really enjoy driving it.  I have almost all the options - sport pkg, touring, handsfree, (except DVD player).  It's very luxurious on the inside; I haven't given up anything.  I can't imagine driving anything else."
infiniti,fx35,2008,Tuan, 01/26/2008,Awesome Crossover,4,"The FX35 AWD is an awesome vehicle. The sport suspension is firm, but nowhere unbearable. The FX handles like a dream. Steering is precise and provides excellent feedback. I like the 350Z's smaller thick leather steering wheel in the FX. The interior quality has improved drastically from the early 2003-2005 models. Plastic and leather are MUCH softer. I have driven the GX, RX, X5, XC90, ML, GL and Cayenne. The best overall value in the midsize crossover is the FX. "
infiniti,fx35,2008,Bill- Atlanta, 10/03/2007,Great Choice,5,"This car has everything I was looking for in a luxury sedan but it is a SUV. I took my time looking for a new car and test drove just about everything on the luxury market. I am about 6'2'' and about 275 pounds.  It fits me like a glove.  Nothing on the market can compare with the comfort and performance along with the luxury at this price. I purchased the FX35 in early September and have not regretted it one day. It has power, performance, room, luxury, and is still decent on the gas. I am getting right at 20 mpg right now and I am not a real gentle driver.  I would recommend this car to anyone."
infiniti,fx35,2008,JP, 09/23/2007,Rocking FX,4,Just picked up an FX and I am completely blown away by it.  Traded in a G35 coupe for it and thought I would be losing a whole lot of sportiness in return for utility but that is not the case.  The FX has great pickup and handles very well for a 4100 lb car. It has ample room for cargo and believe it or not people have asked me about it and commented how sleek it looks.  All this makes me feel that I did the right move.  I do miss my G coupe but I feel I will have just as much fun in my FX. Anyone who test drives one will end buying it. That is how good it is... period!
infiniti,fx35,2008,Richard, 11/07/2007,Wow! I was not expecting...,4,"My wife and I both were amazed at how this SUV handled.  Coming from a BMW 3-series coupe and my wife from a Subaru WRX turbo wagon, the FX handled turns like it was on rails.  My brother has the X5 and it's on par with it.  The 3.5 engine is adequate but if you want a rocket get the 45 instead.  Fit and finish the vehicle is perfect.  All the amenities for the price makes it all worth it.  The comment by the editors about the interior being an elite Nissan, I agree somewhat but it's definitely more appealing than my BMW. Engine is smooth.  Suspension and handling are stiff enuff, so the Sport Susp. would be unnecessary IMO. You won't be disappointed with this SUV. Pull the trigger!"
infiniti,fx35,2008,Great Value, 12/08/2007,Great Value SUV,4,"Purchased car new based on analysis among Lexus RX, Acura MDX, and Toyota Highlander (replaced RX).  By far a better value - great handling especially in windy road conditions - tons of standard features - options are reasonably priced relative to competition.  Driving comfort is second to none.  Back up camera is great feature as there is a blind spot in changing lanes looking out the rear sides.  Car is quieter than anticipated - on screen displays easy to use and make sense.  Best of all - can fit 3 sets of golf clubs in rear much like the RX - so many SUVs today cannot fit golf clubs in the rear compartment without putting the seats down. "
infiniti,fx35,2008,fxhouston, 05/01/2008,08 review,4,Owned for 30 days.  Great car but front seating needs improvement.  I weigh 215 and the seating area is too narrow to ever get comfortable.  Everything else is well thought out; quiet ride and so far performed very well with no trips to the dealer!
infiniti,fx35,2008,Cruzer, 05/15/2008,The Corvette of SUVs,4,"I use my FX35 as a daily driver and my vette on the weekends. The FX has pep, performance, looks, handling,and a nice balance between fun and function. With the high gas prices I've been using regular and don't notice any change in performance. I get 19 mpg in city/highway driving. The vehicle is a 'headturner' since I don't see a lot where I live. The 6 cylinder is lively with a smooth 5 speed auto tranny. Styling is unique and built with quality in Japan. It is responsive whether driving aggressively or just as a normal commuter. You don't need a lot of options. I would skip the costly tech package but definitely get the sport package for performance and better personalize the exterior looks."

A lot to still like: 1) Reliability: no problems to date except a cracked hose and routine maintenance.
2) Handling: great feel of the road; amazing for an SUV; handles the twisties like a sports car; 3) Interior: looks luxurious; 4) Seats: excellent side bolsters and heated/cooled 5) Wheels: super looking 20"" alloys that resists brake dust very well.

We have owned the car for 2 years and all we have done is regular maintenance per the dealer.
Very reliable car, most Japanese cars are!
Just had the transmission firmware updated, seems to shift much better.
Also had the trany power flushed and changed.

Overall, I just don't trust European cars these days.
The BMWs / VWs, I have owned seem to require little $100-300 repairs all the time.
Not the FX, everything works! does not nickel and dime you to death. "
infiniti,fx35,2009,Bionic Cheetah or Metal Scarab?, 09/30/2017,8 Years of Ownership thoughts on first year model,4,"After 8 years and 140k miles I feel like it's time to give a review of this car. In short, this car was definitely ahead of its time when it came out. The exterior design, while polarizing when first released, has held up to the test of time. I still get frequent compliments on the vehicle and when I tell them it's 8 years old they're in disbelief. The around view camera is a feature that makes it easy to maneuver into any spot that can fit the dimensions of the vehicle. The engine still runs strong with zero oil burn, an issue that has plagued this motor in other Infinitis. This car still hauls donkey when floored. The transmission was never great, sometimes it's slow to shift, but it's an issue I've had since brand new so I've learned to adapt to it. The interior has held up well, no bubbles on the dash (parked outside in the sun from 8a-5p at work), leather (maybe it's pleather?) has held up very well and all the interior lighting is still functional. Reliability wise, the engine wouldn't start once but that was due to a dirty intake, now they're cleaned at regular intervals of 15k miles. Other than that, and this being a first year model, I've been very happy with how reliable the vehicle has been.                                                                                                               
 Couple notes on my vehicle: 1) always and still use synthetic oils at 7.5k intervals, 2) transmission oil, while the manual says forever, always changed at 60k miles 3) differential oils changed at 60k intervals as well 4) my vehicle is black with a factory aero kit, never took it to a car wash always self washed or detailed so the paint still looks great. 5)I have an Invidia cat-back exhaust installed (still makes me smile when I floor it through tunnels).  I can only hope that my next car can hold up as well as this in the performance, design, and maintenance departments. Overall, I'm super happy with my purchase and will be sad when the time comes to sell it.

infiniti,fx35,2009,mikeshehade, 07/07/2012,This car is Awesome!,4,"To all those the have Trans issues, its really not that serious, yes it shift a little werid but hardly noticable. You people are freaking picky. The car is [non-permissible content removed] its fast, comfortable, and reliable.
I looked into alot of SUV's and this one is by far the best. X5, M-B, Porshe is a joke. Just the interior on the FX alone is better then these cars. ive had this car for a few months and its been very fun to drive. its like buy a 350Z but a SUV body. if your old and not into sporty cars, dont buy this. Go buy a M-B with its 500 issues and its ugly exterior. "
infiniti,fx35,2009,Eugene, 07/11/2009,Extremely Disappointed,3,"This is my third Infiniti after driving an '04 FX and an '05 G35, which I enjoyed tremendously. I had to have what was marketed as a new and improved FX for '09. I think the new styling is incredible. However, I have never been so unhappy with a vehicle's performance. I'm beside myself - I just threw away $40K+. In slow and go traffic, the shifting is all over the place while it attempts to find the right gear. Unless I'm able to drive aggressively, I find the 7-speed transmission unacceptable. From a stop it performs great. Once at about 22 mph is where I realize issues. Several times, when coming to a stop I thought I got bumped from the rear as the car has lunged - it's just not smooth. :("
infiniti,fx35,2009,chazas, 08/28/2009,Transmission re-flash works wonders,4,"We bought our FX35 last February.  I've been very happy with our purchase, my partner somewhat less so.  The car is great fun to drive.  The exterior takes a bit of getting used to, but the interior is class all the way.  There were two significant issues.  The first is rotten rear visibility - either you get used to relying heavily on the rear view and birds-eye cameras or you don't.  The second was the transmission.  It tended to search for the right gear, refuse to change quickly when floored, and just shift roughly.  But there is now an available transmission re-flash (reprograms the computer) - ask about ITB09-032.  It works wonders, completely solves the problem.  Thanks, Infiniti!"
infiniti,fx35,2009,Dave~NYC, 10/04/2010,Not worth even considering,3,"Why buy this crossover? I bought it and I hate it. And for solely one particular reason. The transmission! Dear infiniti, you tried and failed miserable on manufacturing a 7 speed transmission. Mercedes can make 7 speeds, Lexus can make a seamless 8 speed, but you infiniti are poor at making a 7 speed. Why does this car shift into 7th gear at 25 mph? Whoever is reading this. this car looks nice, it looks sexy, the interior is gorgeous, but only because of the transmission do not buy it. Consider the BMW x5 or x6 or perhaps the Mercedes ml 350 but please do not buy this deceiving SUV. I miss my m45"
infiniti,fx35,2009,khl, 03/24/2009,Excellent but still room for improvement,4,"Review after 1500 miles (Tech/Nav/DlxTour/Prem/Ent): Ample power/torque with responsive steering and braking make this a SUV that drives like a sport sedan. A joy to drive, but a manual transmission option would even be better. Very comfortable quilted leather seats with side bolsters and memory positions. While not as quiet as some luxury cars, the excellent Bose system compensates for any exterior noise that does intrude. All-around cameras make tight parking a snap. Attaining reasonable 20 mpg combined. Power latch on rear hatch is nice, but only emphasizes the missing auto-close feature seen with the competition.  Built-in nav DVD means upgrading maps in future requires Infiniti service."
infiniti,fx35,2009,Jay, 07/25/2009,Just a poor designed car!,3,"I bought a fully loaded FX35, but I am disappointed about the car. When driving in highway, the car sometimes hesitates to shift to a lower gear during acceleration and it chokes up! First time, I reported this problem to the dealer, they told me Infiniti is aware of the problem but doesnt have a fix for it yet, but later on, they took it back and said This is a Normal Behavior! They just had a recall on the replacement of Steering Column Electrical Tilt Motor. Also, only after 5000 miles, the dealer had to keep my car for 1 week to fix rear window. After one week, they gave the car back to me unfixed and told me that Infiniti doesnt have the spare part in inventory!!!"
infiniti,fx35,2009,Unhappy, 10/09/2009,Even More Disappointment,3,"Not only did the transmission not upshift smoothly, now I am getting the same problem as others on the downshift side. Engine revs to 5k as I am pulling in to a stop. Thank goodness my foot is already on the brake. Talk about dangerous. This has shades of the mid-80's Audi all over it. In addition to an intermittently functioning Nav screen, a non-charging iPod, and braking ""pulls"" to the left and right... quite honestly, you can have this machine. Unfortunately, it's on a 4 year corporate lease. Pooched."
infiniti,fx35,2009,essia, 12/01/2012,Continuing satisfied FX35 customer,5,I had a very pleasurable buying experience at the infinti of omaha dealership. The sales team of Dan and Dave worked with me and my budget to get me into an upgraded 2009 model from a 2007. Very happy with the car and the professional way I was treated during the entire buying process. I highly recommend these two individuals when buying a car and the infiniti of omaha dealership
infiniti,fx35,2009,Unhappy, 09/09/2009,Brutal 7 Speed Transmission,4,This is my first Infiniti. While I enjoy the unique exterior style of the new SUV (as well as some of the gadgets) I must admit that the 7 speed transmission drive train leaves me speechless... in a bad way. The transmission wants to shift into high gear (7th?) at road speeds of 25mph. Even in DS mode it is not appreciably different. And if you have to climb any degree of incline at 25mph... wow... the vehicle labors vigorously. There is no downshift without pressing the accelerator halfway to the floorboard; at which point the RPM goes to 5k and the vehicle lungs forward. I hope they do some reprogramming of shift patterns.
infiniti,fx35,2009,renelms, 02/25/2009,Very Good but not great.,4,"My first Infiniti and I am impressed in almost every way.  The car is almost great.  The all around view camera is amazing and surprisingly useful.  I opted away from the Tech. package because I found it very annoying.  Only complaints: 1) On most roads the ride is good but on some rough aggregate roads it is both noisy and a little rough.  2) Transmission is a little slow to downshift for passing.  Not bad, but not that good either.  Overall gas mileage has been 20.2 thru 2300 miles.  Overall I think it is a very good and sporty ride and I found it to be very comfortable during a 600 mile day of driving.  Limited interior storage and space needs to be considered closely. Buy it! "
infiniti,fx35,2009,Mark M., 11/24/2008,Awful Trans!!,4," I had the 2003 FX35 and I loved it. So I just had to have 2009. I like the improved interior and the new look, but the ride is still hard. My main problem is the 7-speed transmission. The car only accelerates smoothly when rapidly accelerating. Accelerating from about 25 mph or 45 mph is awful. It never seems to know what to shift in too. Its a nightmare when driving in traffic because it keeps downshifting and then it lags when it should up shift. I end up using the paddle shifters to make the trans do what it should be doing on its own. I was thinking it was only my car and maybe something is wrong with my trans, but I see that someone else had the same issue. "
infiniti,fx35,2009,Infiniac!, 10/26/2009,Wonderful Car!,5,"This car is amazing!  From the gas mileage (for an SUV) to the tech options, this vehicle has it going on.  It's a pleasure to drive, and a great option for someone who wants a sports car with utility."
infiniti,fx35,2009,Pat Davis, 07/20/2008,A delight to own and drive.,4,"Road performance outstanding by any measurement. Handling, acceleration, braking all exceed previously owned similar class vehicles.

infiniti,fx35,2009,Happy FX owner, 07/24/2008,An honest review of the new FX-35,4,"I am a previous FX-35 owner.  I recently upgraded to the 2009 version.  The ride is MUCH smoother compared to the previous model.  The technological advances are amazing.  The navigation system is better than Lexus.  The radio is fantastic, including the iPod interface allowing you to fully manipulate the iPod using the Infiniti screen.  The tip-tronic shift system is fun to use.  You can use the stick shift or the paddles next to the wheel to up shift and down shift.  The interior and dash board are much nicer now.  I highly recommend the navigation system and the Technology package.  The dynamic cruise control is very useful.  I would VERY highly recommend this car, no questions asked. "
infiniti,fx35,2009,Paul, 07/26/2008,Dynamite,5,"Love this FX after 750 miles. Had the previous generation, and the 2009 is better in all respects. Mileage, comfort, gadgets, looks, braking, performance. Great ride."
infiniti,fx35,2009,TulsaFX, 08/26/2008,2009 Infiniti FX35,4,I traded a 2005 FX35 for the 2009 FX35.  At first I wasn't crazy about the looks but the much improved interior and ride comfort outweighed appearance.  Now after having the car a month I really think it's cool.  I really loved my 2005 and would have kept it had Infiniti not made such great improvements.
infiniti,fx35,2009,NEGOC8R, 09/09/2008,Great Upgrade from my 1st Gen 2003FX!!,4,"Traded in my 2003 fully loaded FX35 for the 2009 with everything except for DVD this time.  Like others wasn't crazy about looks such as grille and new color choices but, my Mojave Cooper w/mad-frown and wide arched hood has really grown on me. The DCA technology is the most impressive, actually pushes back off gas pedal and applies brakes when it detects a car in front, even in stop and go traffic. Other music and nav tech features are really fun. I don't understand how they made it faster and yet get slightly better MPG too, have not averaged below 20 yet after 2K miles. Braking and handling has also improved much over my 2003.   "
infiniti,fx35,2009,Mike Sheridan, 09/13/2008,My New 2009 FX35,4,"I love this vehicle!!  I test drove every SUV on the market before buying this one.  I drove the Porsche, Benz, the Toyota, Lexus, Ford, Dodge, and the BMW.  None compare with the comfort and goodies that come with this one.  Did I say I love it?? I owned a BMW X5 before buying this vehicle and there is no comparison in the ride, feel and comfort.  This vehicle is by far the most outstanding of all the SUVs on the market. "
infiniti,fx35,2009,Jonathan, 09/22/2008,Almost,4,"This is a replacement of my 2005 FX35, which I liked this has improved comfort, seats and ride.  My main problem is the awful 7-speed transmission, badly programmed.  This is supposed to be a sporty car.  The car only accelerates smoothly when rapidly accelerating. Accelerating from about 25 mph or 45 mph requires full accelerator to get a downshift or nothing happens quickly. Around those speeds the transmission cant seem to make up its mind and makes it hard to maintain a constant speed with frequent downshifting. I have never owned a car with such inconsistent throttle response."
infiniti,fx35,2009,Andre, 12/13/2008,Best SUV I've ever driven,4,"Traded my 2006 Acura MDX for 2009 FX35. Tried 2009 MDX- didn't like it. FX drives almost like a sports car, not like an SUV. Great handling, nav. system and back up camera are beyond belief, great leg room. Exterior is unbelievable, looks very aggressive. In my opinion, FX beats MDX hands down, except, of course, for the utility part. Luggage room is practically non-existent. Two weeks ago I drove six people and 5 suitcases in my MDX. Definitely won't be able to do it in FX. Other than that it's an unbelievable vehicle!"
infiniti,fx35,2009,BManFX, 12/24/2008,Back to the Future FX,4,"Lease ended on my 07 M35,  and went for the new 2009 FX35.  Got the Premium Package , Nav Package and Technology Package.  Did not get the  20"" wheel package.  The 20s still make the car ride too rough and cost a lot more to replace than the 18s .  Really like all the improvements in the car. The ride is 100% better than the previous model and even quieter than my 07 M35.  It still is a bit rough if you are into a Lexus cush, but I think a lot of folks will like the balance of sport and lux.  Tech features are amazing and really work!! A lot of this will become standard in the future on all cars.   Check it out!"
infiniti,fx35,2009,Dave, 01/17/2009,Second FX35,4,"I traded a 2005 FX35 for a 2009 FX35. Got all the bells and whistles with this new model. I love (most) everything about the car and generally agree with all of the posts here; however, there is one thing that is a negative. The front seats are quite a bit HARDER than the old model. I believe the seats had to be redesigned to provide for their new airflow. They are a bit like slightly uncomfortable shoes. If I were younger (I'm 45) I would not have noticed; however, the older one gets, the more things, in general, become uncomfortable! I still love this car. The seats are my only gripe!"
infiniti,fx35,2009,Steven, 01/19/2009,What were they thinking?,4,"This is our 3rd FX35 since 2003, our 8th Infiniti overall since then. This blows away my 2003 and 2007 FX35.  However, two issues that they fell asleep on. They took away the compass on the mirror, and the compact flash reads some things and misses others. No current support on that issue.  The compass was useful when navigation did not have an address in its database. Now, forced to look at the little compass on the nav screen and figure out which way you headed.  It takes a few seconds to figure it out when you could just look at your mirror and see the direction by letters. The cd harddrive takes forever to copy songs into memory, basically useless.  Compact flash very picky and fussy."
infiniti,fx35,2009,nyalgaidin, 02/08/2009,"2009 FX35, stylish fun with practicality",4,"FX35 AWD 2009 Platinum Graphite/graphite with Premium, Navigation, splash guards, illuminated step.  For the price, this SUV has superb value and retains most of the excitement of a G35/M35 while increasing refinement and space.  Rides smooth and solid, like a tank on rollers and is amazingly agile for its size.  Fits 4 adults perfectly.  Classy yet contemporary interior is intuitive and instantly driver friendly.  Advanced technology such as 360* view cameras, fast navigation, powerful speakers, and smart lighting makes for a convenient and practical ride.  7 gears makes for better mileage and efficiency."
infiniti,fx35,2009,David, 02/09/2009,Great Crossover,4,Replaced my 2005 FX 35 when the lease expired with the new 09. Great SUV with the deluxe and premium packages that have the 20 inch wheels. It is certainly an upgrade from the 05 with nicer interior and better ride. It seems that there is more leg room  in the front in the 09. In city driving the 7 speed transmission seems to change frequently but on the hwy it is really smooth. This would be my only complaint.
infiniti,fx35,2009,Travis McGee, 03/10/2009,Love it!,4,"Had a 2002 MDX, and was negotiating for an '09, but one test drive of the FX35 and I was done. If you're looking for a crossover that's fun to drive, you'll love the FX. Not as roomy or comfy as the MDX, but that's not the point, is it?"
infiniti,fx35,2009,John, 03/21/2009,The greatest SUV I've ever driven!!,5,"This SUV/crossover will turn heads!! The greatest I've ever driven, nothing like '08 model. The acceleration is quick & brakes are responsive. The fronts seats are so comfortable even for me (I'm 6'03) The back seats are a little bit of a tight fit for taller passengers. Parallel parking in tight spots with the all-around view camera is so easy. The navigation is fairly easy to use.  The 20"" wheels complete the look nicely, I recommend them highly. This is just a beautiful classy car that is so fun to drive."
infiniti,fx35,2009,msu79gt82, 03/31/2009,My 2nd FX35,4,"I like the 09 MUCH better than my old 04!  Smoother quieter ride with a much more refined interior (definitely the nicest interior of any car I've owned; including 3 Acura's and 2 other Infiniti's). I think the exterior styling is an improvement and think it looks good. I prefer the new ""wavey"" grill to the old ""dimpled"" grill.  Its definitely not the plain vanilla car most folks drive (how many RXs are there on the road?). Mileage is OK (about what I expected); I am puzzled by a previous reviewer giving a 20.2 average mpg a rating of only 5?  Infiniti has the nicest most compact key fobs on the market - great for guys who hate a lot of stuff in their pockets.  A great fun to drive car!!"
infiniti,fx35,2009,JC, 03/31/2009,From '07 G35 to the FX...Nice Surprise!,5,"2nd Infiniti. I had a 2007 G35X and absolutely loved it, but changed jobs and had to drive down the Turnpike every weekend and the drive wasn't so fun anymore.  The FX performs and even drives like my G did, except it is a lot smoother.  I really enjoy the IPOD interface.  I agree with some of the bloggers about the 7speed transmission. I notice a slight hesitation when I am accelerating from 35 to 55 (very slight though). Having come from a G35, I find that I can't feel 80mph when driving... the car is that smooth. I purchased the NAV,Premium, Deluxe touring and enjoy the 360 cameras. Test drove the BMW and was very disappointed with drive and available technology features - Germans need help!"
infiniti,fx35,2009,Tim, 04/09/2009,"Great car, not comfortable",3,"For a high end SUV the FX35 competes well, with some really nice features and tight solid construction. The controls are intuitive and usable, its nav system works great and the feature set is impressive.  Comfort is a real drawback. The seats are good, but rear seating is cramped and there is limited cargo space. Space in the front seats is limited as well, with none of the little cubby holes and slots I am used to seeing in well designed cars.  The ride is one word - punishing. You will feel every bounce and bump in the road.  Pass on the technology package, it is annoying, constantly beeping and interfering with your driving style. "
infiniti,fx35,2009,CompGeek8157, 04/10/2009,Infiniti is on a roll!,5,"I used to have an 07 G fully loaded and used to have an FX before that. So I know what I'm getting into and I'm not disappointed at all. This new FX35 is as fast as the previous gen FX45. The 7 speed auto is really good while cruising on the highway. The rpms stay around 2500 for 75 mph. Not bad for a vehicle of this size. I got the AWD, Prem, Nav, Deluxe touring. I would say the Deluxe touring is a must have. The 20"" look awesome on the FX. Over all it blows the competition out of water. No plastic wood no cheap stuff. Good sound insulation when compared with the G. Absolutely no rattles and everything is very tight and solidly built.  "
infiniti,fx35,2009,jayrandall, 04/28/2009,2009 FX35,4,"This is my second FX35.  I turned in a RWD '06 with Sport and Touring only.  The new vehicle (AWD, Premium, Nav and Deluxe) takes the FX to a new level.  Much tighter vehicle all around, better craftsmanship, it's a whole new world.  The car is a joy to drive, and when you are on the highway, the drive is remarkably smooth.  Highly recommended.   I chose the Liquid Platinum and Java leather combo.  With the 20"" rims, the 'silver on silver' look works."
infiniti,fx35,2009,Brunoblake, 05/03/2009,Very impressed,4,"Just picked up my new FX35 - only got the premium package, but it is plenty since the car comes fairly loaded! Excellent engine performance (same dual- throttle V6 as the new Z), redesigned interior is on par with Lexus and Mercedes, and the cost is fair for what you get. Believe it or not, I bought it partially because it is family- friendly: the rear seats fit three booster seats with room to spare!"
infiniti,fx35,2009,Anthony N., 05/07/2009,I love my FX,5,"Coming from 3 consecutive BMW coupes, this car is a pleasure to drive.  No more worries about pot holes and low profile tires.  Hoping Japanese quality will treat my wallet better after the warranty runs out.  Handling is extremely responsive, braking was surprisingly better than I would have thought for a heavy SUV.  No regrets at all."
infiniti,fx35,2009,Hiren, 05/07/2009,Awesome!!,4,"I wanted to buy a sedan but after I drove this one I fell for it. It has great handling like a sport sedan, the exterior and interior is of superb quality and overall drives great! I suggest you buy it with the nav and the tech package and you will have everything under the sun!! The mileage is same as any V6 300hp car produces."
infiniti,fx35,2009,John, 05/27/2009,Great SUV but 7spd leaves questions,4,I've had the FX35 for a little over a month now and it has been a blast to drive.  Interior layout is very clean & well thought out. Everything flows perfectly.  I know some don't like the exterior but it has grown on me. I would recommend getting the Deluxe Touring package which gives you the 20 inch wheels. The 18s are a bit small compared to the size of the FX.  All the tech features work well. The Nav has room for improvement. You can't use the all the features when in motion. The search function needs to be more customizable.  Its 7spd tranny is way too slow to respond. It hunts for the right gear in traffic. It has slipped a couple of times. They should have left the old 5spd in.
infiniti,fx35,2009,BRUCE, 06/09/2009,My 3rd FX 35AWD,4,"This is the best FX to date. Got prem/navig./tech - way superior to the 06&07 models, handles and rides much better. Great pickup, excellent brakes, fit and finish far better, navig., around view camera excellent. Styling is a love/hate - no cookie cutter here. Unique and bold - a true sports truck. Best bang for the buck. Acura, BMW - no comparison... electronics styling way beyond the competition."
infiniti,fx35,2009,Jaimarsh, 06/18/2009,Great Performance Vehicle!,4,"This is a great vehicle.  Performance is outstanding, and the fit and finish is of the highest quality - truly a luxury car.  Rear interior space is somewhat limited compared to a ""regular"" crossover SUV, but is still more room than a sedan.  The limited rear visibility is not a serious problem, but it means that the back-up camera is an absolute must- have.  Mileage has been poor (16 mpg) on mostly in-town driving, but you should not be buying this car for great mileage. The handling is great, but the car seems to have a slight hesitation when it down-shifts while coasting at slow (below 20 mph) speeds.  Don't know if that is due to CVT or something else. Overall, one great vehicle!"
infiniti,fx35,2009,Les, 06/18/2009,Great SUV!!,4,"Traded in 2007 FX35 and got top dollar plus great deal on the 2009 FX. 2009 is much more comfortable: upgraded leather, cooled seats. Premium & touring packages made this a must buy. New front end a little strange but it is a sharp looking SUV and I get questions about it wherever I go. A/C keeps the car cool even in Mississippi summers. Quieter on the highway too.  Will keep it."
infiniti,fx35,2009,Amir, 07/07/2009,Miss my old FX35,3,"I had the 1st FX for 5yrs. Loved the car. So I had to get the new one. Big mistake! Great gadgets, great look! But the new transmission takes away all the joy! It downshifts like someone driving a stick shift for the 1st time. Very lazy, not smooth, brakes are horrible. The car downshifts and accelerates in traffic at the same time and it's in gear 6 or 7 when you're driving 30 miles. So to accelerate the car your really have to kick down hard and it takes days for the car to respond. My experience has been so bad, I'll be changing the car soon. "
infiniti,fx35,2009,Anthony, 08/06/2009,BMW to Infiniti...couldn't be happier,4,"PROS: nice body styling, 360 cam is awesome, leg room, instrument panel design, navigation, cooled seats, handles GREAT.  Great freeway mileage.  CONS: no full power trunk door, transmission is slow sometimes unless you floor it, poor gas mileage, wish the trunk organizer was to one side of the trunk instead of smack in the middle not allowing you to put any big items in without having to fold it down.  Very fun to drive, and I love the big gas tank.  "
infiniti,fx35,2009,Mar, 07/24/2009,Love it!,5,"I traded a Mazda RX8 a few years ago for an Infiniti G35 couple. I thought I was getting more room while keeping the fun drive.  I just traded in my G35 for a new FX35 and I am in love! This car has incredible style, has great pickup and hugs the road far more than my G35 did.  Plus I get the extra room that I didn't have in either of my last two cars.  I still miss the sports car feel of the RX8, but this FX35 makes me smile every time I get in and push the start button.  Highly recommend it!"
infiniti,fx35,2009,socal, 08/07/2009,Sports Car in the Body of an SUV,4,"Huge improvement over '08- refined interior, more power, better ride. Almost bought the Lexus RX350. FX a little more edge and a lot more performance. Gadgets galore. Highly recommend the bigger wheels to offset the longer hood. Exclusivity as factory not making as many. Highly reliable- not a single issue with my '08. If you are looking for a sports car with some utility this is your ride. "
infiniti,fx35,2009,Romeb2k, 08/21/2009,Performs as Advertised,4,"Good mix between luxury & performance. Luxury on par with RX330 (prev auto) but performance is superior. Plus, you only see limited quantities on the road. Manual shift toggles are a blast! Gadgets galore. Fully loaded w/all 5 pkgs. Active/passive safety features were draw to FX. 7 sp trans works well despite complaints from other reviews. If I need additional power/response I use the toggles and shift manually. Interior space is adequate. I am 6-3 and I can fit comfortably in front seats/rear seats are a little cramped on legroom. The FX35 allows the best of both worlds, I can fulfill my performance desire as well as obtaining moderate functionality of SUV.             "

It drives great (now the transmission is fixed), looks great, sounds great, and is priced great when compared to so called rivals. I test drove the Acura, Lexus, and BMW competing SUV's.  Although they all had some great highlights, overall the Infiniti blew them away.  It has the performance of the BMW's, all the features of the Acura, and much much better styling then the Lexus. "
infiniti,fx35,2009,FX Lover, 09/16/2009,I'm FXed!,5,"Recently traded in my '04 FX35 for an '09 FX35 and have no regrets.  Comfort is all you feel when driving or riding in it. The '09 FX35 is significantly smoother and quieter than the '04. I actually enjoy driving now...doesn't feel (or sound) like an SUV but rather a luxury vehicle.  The controls are all within easy reach. The Technology Package is a must! As far as the gas consumption, it's not any better than my '04.  My opinion is that if you can afford to buy a new FX35, fuel prices/consumption should not be an issue. TIP: Drive it w/TLC! "

Between the climate controlled seats, key fob options, electronically controlled retractable mirrors, 360 degree view camera, Nav, reclining back seats, intelligent AWD, great ride, and unique looks, this car is the best! When doing the Edmunds comparison with its competitors the MDX, X5, X6, and RX the FX really shines.  Tightest turning radius (by far), offers most front leg room (by many inches), 2nd best in gas mileage, and is one of the least expensive. If you need an SUV for hauling ability this is not for you.  If you are looking for more of the ""sport"" from the sports utility vehicle category there is no other choice."
infiniti,fx35,2009,gogofx, 09/26/2009,Awesome Vehicle,4,"Overall I love this car. I think its the perfect vehicle for sports car guys that need just a little bit of utility. Great get-up and go power, has all the amenities that I need right now. The only thing that is a bit annoying is the upshift with the transmission, there is a hesitation at times that is very noticeable. But, overall a wonderful vehicle. "

I test drove an X5, Q7, RX, ML and nothing drove and handled as well for the value.  I bought every option package and got online (buy all my cars by way of carsdirect) for $9780 off sticker.  I was only not able to get the illuminated kick plates. I plan to see if my transmission needs to be reflashed for software, but it actually seems to be improving with mileage so maybe won't need to soon."

The FX fit the bill to a T.  The NAV works great (once I figured it out), around view cameras are wonderful, gas mileage is not bad for an SUV of this class, and it still works great for hauling the kids and groceries. I traded in a BMW X5 that I loved, but now don't miss at all anymore.  The FX gets much better mileage, and the interior styling blows away both the X5 as well as the X6.   "

Once you get used to it, it's a breeze. 20 inch tires and rims look great, as well as the real maple wood trim inside.  Upgraded leather has a very rich feel to it. I am not sure if my transmission was repaired from the dealership already, but no problems so far (3,500 miles).  "

I traded in my Lexus RX 330 with no regrets.  The interior is lovely with many features.  I just wish that the rear offered better visibility.  You really need to be careful when making a lane change.   I rely a lot on my mirrors and must turn my head to look before I change lanes.  Wicked blind spot.  I also wish that they had a self closing rear hatch.  Otherwise, love this car and very  happy with the purchase.  I will let you know how the AWD does when snow flies.

So far, a lot of disappointments  1) It's slower! I punch it getting on the freeway, it hiccups.  The 2006 took off!  2) Adding Nav adds other functions, like touchscreen, traffic, but diminishes other features: a) Reduces bluetooth phonebook capacity by 75% b) eliminates ability to program pause (worked on 06) c) added, cumbersome steps to dial phone d)sound system audio quality diminished e) ipod interface nice, but ipod, battery runs down after car shutoff - auto-turn-on, not turnoff. 3) much less room in backseat-my riders complain 4) promised improved mileage is really worse -just a bigger gas tank."

I traded in my 05 FX35 that I loved, and fell in love all over again.  What a fun to drive, eye catching, high tech, sporty vehicle with utility available.  Infiniti nailed this one.  I really enjoyed the last FX I had, but this improved on what was already a masterpiece!  The gas mileage is about the same (but this time I have the AWD), and the rear visibility is still pretty poor.  Other then that everything else has improved! "

I have never been so unhappy with a vehicle's performance and fuel economy. My old one was showing about 13-14 mpg mostly city drive and new ""IMPROVED"" shows the same, driving experience horrible, unless I drive about 70-80mph. In slow traffic the shifting is all over the place sometimes it feels like someone bumps you behind. Also maybe because car is to heavy or because of transm issues, when my car starts driving it feels like it's choking on fuel. I took car already a few times to dealer who claims that he did some re-programming, but so far I do not see any changes and think it will be my last Infiniti."

infiniti,fx35,2009,Rick, 12/28/2009,TERRIBLE TRANSMISSION,3,The 7 speed transmission is a disaster.  I took it back but they said the software upgrade was done. It shifts up to 7th gear by 40 mph so if you come to a hill you have to take it down 2 speeds otherwise it struggles.  Constantly shifting and the tranny brakes the car when you take your foot off the gas.  IT RUINS THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE OF THE CAR...VERY DISAPPOINTING.  I'M READY TO GET RID OF IT ALREADY ...HAD IT 3 MONTHS.  I got the Premium and Deluxe wheel package...both worth it and very nice.  Seats are hard.  Bluetooth is nice.  Wood trim is beautiful.

I purchased the FX35 for it's reliability and I wanted as much of the RRS handling and size as I could get. The FX didn't infatuate me, I just needed out of the RRS. I am now in love with this vehicle. Handling is not quite to the level of the RRS, but the ""fun to drive"" factor/cost goes to the FX35. The shifting issues are mostly resolved with premium fuel. My fuel economy of highway/city mix is a steady 19MPG! I feel this is good for any vehicle with this speed/performance/AWD. I look forward to my drive everyday! The FX35 is just easy to love. No dealer visits to date (7000 miles)."
infiniti,fx35,2009,firstandlastInfiniti, 02/04/2010,Review after 3 months of driving it...,3,"I have driven the car for 3 months and 3000 miles. I agree with ""Rick"" - 7 speed tranny ruins the overall experience of owning this car.  Shifts all over the place (I have the latest transmission flash) and still show very harsh downshifting after releasing the gas pedal (this initially scared the daylights out of me when it first happened, now I just come to expect it).  Only ""DS"" (Drive Sport) mode returns control to the driver and allows you to get around horrible gear ratios and indecisiveness of the computer as to what gear the car needs.  Also, brakes are VERY soft - takes longer to stop and gas mileage is mediocre.  No tranny change 2010 so if you consider buying you're warned."
infiniti,fx35,2009,renelms, 06/23/2010,Great for the right person,4,"Very nice vehicle that you will probably love or hate.  I have really enjoyed it but my wife doesn't want in it.  Throttle and brake responses are a little touchy, the ride can be bad on bad roads but is normally very compliant.  Drivers position, height and controls are very comfortable and well placed.  Cabin is snug for a SUV but near perfect for the Sport SUV it was designed to be.  Not overly impressive in any road comparisons to a car, yet if feels very sporty in every way and is very enjoyable to drive if you need a SUV but want a sports car.  Fast or slow I average 20 mpg and have had no problems other than a dealership that seems to think they are the only ones in town.  Cool Ride!"
infiniti,fx35,2009,deninfiniti, 10/10/2013,Great Car - Hate the transmission,4,"I have owned my FX for over 2 years now and love how comfortable it is to drive (my first trip was 1200 miles and I felt as fresh stepping out of it as when I had got in!).
The engine is great and has plenty of power.
My main gripe is the 7 speed transmission... it sucks.
I often find myself trying to pass other traffic and putting my foot to the floor and nothing happening for 1-2 seconds... once you get passed this point fine, but that lag can seem like an eternity.
I had it re-flashed and that helped a little, but this is definitely something more fundamental..... But if they fixed this I would definitely get another."
infiniti,fx35,2009,GLR, 09/09/2010,My 2nd FX and Lovin it !,4,"If you want a sports car with a backpack this is it! This is our 2nd FX, (Prem/Tech/Nav/RearEnt.). Our first FX was an 06 which my wife and I really enjoyed driving. I did notice the quirks of the new 7-speed but were resolved with the software updates. Having XM/cooling seats/dvd/nav/mp3/rain sensing wipers makes the FX a great cruiser on long road trips, I dont know how we drove long distance without Adaptive Cruise and Lane Departure Prevention they work really well. We drove 900 miles(hwy) with cruise control set @ 75mph & averaged 24 mpg. The technology, maintenance & reliability are simply amazing and are a bargain when compared to its European counterparts. Fun to drive, buy one!  "
infiniti,fx35,2009,jah53, 10/18/2011,Sports Car/SUV - A Great Mix,5,"Handles like a sports sedan (very similar to Adui Q5) but with additional practicality and great view of road. This was a prime consideration for me 

Great looking (and unique) exterior, beautiful interior - although I would prefer a bit more of the Maple and Aluminum trim, and it could really use some additional leather on the door panels at this price 

Milage is disappointing - have never gotten better than 22 mpg (and is generally 17 - 18) with AWD.
While power is very good - milage is less than my previous M-B E430 4Matic

Limited luggage space compared to other SUVs - but this is an OK trade-off since it handles a LOT better than other SUVs

Dealer experience is not up to M-B"
infiniti,fx35,2009,C. MURPHY, 08/13/2019,BEST CAR EVER!!!!!,5,"I have the FX 35.it's a 2009,and i have around 36,000 miles on it. never any trouble!!!! I still love the design!!! I see no other car on the roead that i like better!!! Love it!!!!
"
infiniti,fx35,2010,Driving Enthusiast, 07/30/2016,Impressive All Season Sportscar,5,"I would call the FX35 an All Season Sportscar (I wonder why Infiniti didn't call it that...). You don't buy this car because you need room or utility. You buy this because you want a sports car that can be driven year round and in adverse conditions.

First of all, the styling. While it might not be for everyone, I don't think anyone can argue it's bland. It is a striking design, and it is rare enough on the road that they really stand out. Kudos to Infiniti for rolling out a production car that actually looks like its concept sibling.

Now onto performance, what this All Season Sportscar really excel at. I've had the pleasure of taking a high performance driving course with this car, and the theme of the day was ""Underestimated"". The brakes may look small next to the 20"" wheels, but they are surprisingly powerful and resilient. After a day at the track, the factory brakes were still going strong. And did I mention how strongly the car pulls and how good it sounds doing it? It's almost as if it's bending the laws of physics to do it. Handling is superb as well - it never once felt like I was driving tall heavy SUV through the slaloms and the avoidance maneuvers. The only thing that gave it away was the ride height - you won't be fooled into thinking you are in a Miata. The suspension is stiff enough through corners that the vehicle never feels ""soft"", yet for everyday commute it absorbs imperfections nicely. The car is much more capable within its performance envelope than any of us that day gave it credit for. However that doesn't mean you should get reckless behind it though - once you kick past the envelope and the laws of physics kick in, you're in the next zip code over before the 4200lb+ All Season Sportscar comes to a complete stop. 

Utility, storage volume in particular, is probably the Achilles' heel of the FX35. The spare tire under the rear cargo area bumps up the floor considerably. Couple that with the rakish coupe roofline, you have a low and wide opening that makes it next to impossible to load crates. The rear seats do fold down nicely, and the roof is considerably higher above the rear seats if you want to play some back seat tetris with your cargo. On a plus side though, because the roof is rakish and the hinge of the rear hatch is located so far forward, you can back the vehicle into a garage, and the hatch can still open even with only about a foot of space to the wall. Try doing that with other SUVs.

In terms of utility off road, it does quite well light offroading, such as snow, mud, gravel or inclement weather conditions. With a good set of winter tires, the vehicle can handle snow covered mountain forest service roads without any drama (I have AWD). 

The interior is also a very welcoming and cozy space. The ambient lighting in the door handles is a very elegant touch, particularly if you have the maple accents. There are actually footwell accent lights too, but they are so dim (unless you swap them to LEDs) that they are not visible other than in the darkest of nights. The seats are very comfortable and well supported - no fatigue or butt cramps after long drives what-so-ever. Surfaces you are often in contact with are covered with soft leather material that just makes the whole cabin very luxurious-feeling. The backseat can recline to a very comfortable angle.

The technology in the vehicle also leaves very little to be desired. I do not have the adaptive cruise control or lane departure warning systems, so I can't speak to those. The surround view camera though is absolutely brilliant. I call it ""cheat mode"", because it allows you to park the car in tight spaces with such confidence and ease that you'll passengers will be screaming ""Aww that's not fair!"". The Bose audio system is crisp, and if you're an avid CD listener you'll be happy to know the car will happily gobble up all the tracks on your CD
 and store them on its harddrive, so you never have to carry a stack of CDs with you. The navigation is also well voiced. Voice recognition is fast, although it can't take in a whole chunk of address at a time (i.e. you got to say the house number, wait, street address, wait, city, wait, etc). Unlike those OCD German car designs, the screen is a touchscreen, and the recessed setup makes it easily legible even in bright conditions. 

Another interior feature (somewhat useless) I really like is when you first get behind the wheels and turn the vehicle on (the push start button is supposed to pulse like the beating heart by the way), the steering column with lower and move towards you while the seat slides forward to your set seating position. The sequence is reversed when you get out of the vehicle. Really makes it feel like you're getting behind a X-Wing or something. 

Overall, I can't be happier with this All Season Sportscar. After about two years, it still brings a smile to my face every time I get behind the wheels, and I still catch myself admiring its lines.

Final price was about $56K with all the bells and whistles. I have to admit I am a little disappointed by this year's model. Ext design wise - you either love it or hate it. The tech stuff - stay away from it. Doesn't worth the money, doesn't work from time to time. Don't like the fact they use the same cheap console nobs on all their models.

After mediocre to poor dealer experience we thought why stick with Audi just because. We test drove a Lexus,BMW, and finally the Infiniti and we were impressed by the dealer experience and of course the vehicle. Great value from Infiniti and awesome build quality which we didn't expect."
infiniti,fx35,2010,Andy McG, 10/02/2010,Astounding,4,"I've always liked the Fx for its concept look, and decided to get one this fall. I couldn't be happier. The look is polarizing, but I can't take my eyes off of it--!-- and have been complimented regularly since getting it. I love the flared front wheel wells and overall aggressive look. Very quick, feels like its on rails handling curves. Beautiful interior-- embroidered seats, large, bright nav screen, easy- to-use interface make driving a joy. If you want a unique vehicle that beautifully blends a sports car with an SUV, this is your ride. There are RXs, MDXs, and X3s everywhere, but this is still only occasionally seen on the road...I love that in particular. "
infiniti,fx35,2010,Eric , 07/16/2010,Why buy any other Crossover - really?,5,"This is our 3rd inifiniti (G35Coupe, FX45). I've always loved the infiniti brand and while I wasn't originally overjoyed by the new styling of the FX (I still like my 05FX45's styling better - but that's me) once I got in it and drove it I realized, it didn't matter.  I was also concerned with going from our amazingly powerful FX45's V8 to the 35's V6 but I have to say - this is noticeably quicker.  I didn't necessarily like the ride of the 45 they've apparently worked out all of that with the redesign because this thing rides very comfortably.  It's tight, crazy quick, and still maintains inifiniti's unmistakable sound.  I like the rev match as I drive it like a sports car - i.e. very fast."

Transmission problem with the Infinity FX35.
I do not feel safe driving this car.
Transmission gets stuck between 3rd and 4th gear causing lag in speed.
Can't pass or merge into traffic without worrying that I will not be able to pick up speed.
Does not happen every time so can't prepare.
Then when stoping, car lurches forward. Dealer claims that it is due to the change they made from a 5 speed to a 7 speed and that is just the way the car drives.
Are you kidding me?
Look up transmission problems on Edmonds for this car.
Many complaints.
They want to charge me over $4000.00 to return the car. And they consider this a favor!!
There is no fix nor change to newer model"
infiniti,fx35,2010,Erik, 03/09/2010,A fantastic combination,4,"This car offers a unique combination for the discriminating purchaser. I have absolutely no need for a third row of seats or a rear seat entertainment system. The quality of the interior is superb as compared to the BMW X5 and Lexus G460. It offers better gas mileage and displays personality without exuding excess. I test drove the Acura, Lexus, BMW, Mercedes, and others and came away with this as the clear winner for me and my mission statement. Ride, power, prestige, athleticism are a special combination."

I wanted a sports car feel with some utility and a little height to get me off the road and thats when I finally settled on Infiniti FX35.  Ill be honest I'm very picky when it comes to quality and I could not be more pleased with this vehicle.  Everything on this SUV is solid and well put together.  The only thing Ive found to be not that great is the MPG.  However I knew going into the purchase what kind of MPG I was going to get.  I average 20-23 on FWY at speeds of 65-80 MPH.  City is about 14-18 MPG.  Great vehicle I love it! "
infiniti,fx35,2010,drojt, 11/22/2011,Buyer Beware,2,"Before you spend 45K (+) for this vehicle, please note that is has a major design flaw in its transmission. Please take the time to read all of the consumer reviews at Edmunds and at various Infiniti web forums.
The transmission up shifts too quickly so in essence you are in 7 gear by 38 MPH, thus getting up to speed (downshifting) in a passing situation is trying and thus a safety issue in my humble opinion.
I am not please with this vehicle and it will be scrapped very soon. Knowing this issue, shame on Infiniti for not upgrading the tranny as there are numerous customer complaints when this model was introduced. Never again wil I own an Infiniti so buy at your own risk!"
infiniti,fx35,2010,karnip, 02/20/2010,2010 FX35 AWD,4,Loved the look of the FX from day one. There is no vehicle on the road that can match the unique exterior design. Had to have one.

After having an M35 for a few years, I know what to expect. I tested Mercedes E350 (just like M series but pay for name), BMX 5xx (outgoing body style that I never loved), Cadillac SRX (stiff seats an low power), Buick LaCrosse (no power), Acura TL, and more. I ended up with the FX as I was ready for some elevation from the road for a few years and there is good room for my 4 year old. The loyalty cash didn't hurt, either.  Great acceleration. Why do they bother with the FX50? Unique love it or hate it look. Not like every other car of the road, a-la RX350"
infiniti,fx35,2010,officialme, 04/03/2010,Surprised I Own It,4,"Don't let the MSRP price for the FX35 turn you away. I got $8,000 off MSRP! I negotiated invoice price first & then minus a $4,000 national incentive for a price of $42,200. I was down to the Audi Q5 & the FX35. The FX35 beat the Audi Q5 due to the price, larger size, better reliability, & outside look. The FX35 has a bold outside look and you will either love or hate it. However, I can testify that the car is a head turner. You will also fall in love with the interior. The leather seats are amazing and the black wood inlay & aluminum trim is more sylish for this 40 yr old male than the typical wood inlay you find in other cars. The Infiniti logo is a nice look on the seats and floor mats."

Love the power and handling.  View is great, and interior is luxurious.  This is my second Infiniti, and I love the brand.  Strong engine, great features.  Appears MPG will be better than my 06 M, but still early.  7 speed takes a bit to get used to, but seems to fit well with the engine.  Just so you know, there is a pretty significant blind spot due to the shape of the rear windows.  But a well built, fun to drive, head turning crossover.  And it does have decent storage in the back."

It is a fun car to drive and has all the features we would want in any car.  Very well made and I like the AWD feature for snow in Chicago but the rear wheel drive for most driving conditions.

This car is a head turner - although more aggressively styled than its predecessor and labeled a ""love it or hate it styling"", I have gotten several compliments about how nice my car looks. The interior is very nice - similar to the G35- I wish they would apply the wood trim to the console and dash like they did in the g35 to make it more luxurious.

The rear hatch had a plastic strip detach and bend my roof (there's a recall for this). The engine knocks when cold (there's a recall for this). The dealer still hasn't fixed it after 3 tries. The tires keep losing pressure and then there's an annoying beep (dealer says that comes with the terriorty of having tire pressure sensors.) The most serious problem, the steering wheel knocks when turning to the left.The dealer changed the Rack & Pinion on it 3 times (that's a SERIOUS mechanical problem) and the SAME problem keeps coming back.You would think this car is a lemon but NO. The dealer says it's not. I'm stuck with a car that's not worth the price"

It is fast, fun to drive, reliable, safe, gorgeous, and loaded with amazing features.  The fuel economy is not a strong point, but the performance more than makes up for it.  Every time I get behind the wheel I grin ear to ear.  The sound system is wonderful, and the navigation system is easy to use.  Climate control and radio are separate from the navigation system, which is a huge plus (Are you listening, BMW?).  I absolutely recommend this car."

Cayenne Turbo-at $95,000. Compares more 
than favorably to the Cayenne S and you get 
much more for your money. So much gagetry

my kids amused. Very highly recommended; 
there's really no point in considering the 
Mercedes/BMW/Porsche SUVs unless you're

It is fast, corners great, stops 
incredibly well. However, in creating 
an SUV that really performs like a 
sports car...something has to go...and 
a soft ride is the trade. If I had one 
decision to make over it would be to go 
with the 18"" wheels instead of the 20"". 
However, no matter what...I have a 
Lexus SC430 in the garage too, and 
almost always choose to drive the FX45. 
By the way...the rear camera is one of 
the nicest features. It really helps 
you in backing up and parallel parking. "

 it even applies the brakes.

The Intelligent Key system is great. 
Seat memories associate themselves 
with the remotes. I get in: seat moves

just a gem, and the transmission

you'll just know where the

corner this baby much faster than the

I test drove those trucks.  If you are

look no further.  The X5 and the

An adjustable suspension should be

be able to soften it when you want to go
on a soothing Sunday drive with the family.

My only real complaint so far is that
the drivers seat occasionally squeeks
during lateral motion.  I'll be having
the dealer look at this soon, and have
learned that adjusting the seat makes it
go away."

infiniti,fx45,2004,Suzan Turner, 06/01/2017,Infiniti FX45 is AMAZING!,5,"A bit pricy new! But used, with lower miles, will get ya there in style! My fx45 is now 13 years old. Still performers like it did the first year! I still get compliments on it and it's timeless design makes it seem like a much newer SUV. It has plenty of power! Fun to drive and after more than a decade of owning it, still have pride of ownership. The tech and all options package(gps,rear camera, Bose system, 20"" rims, sunroof etc) was way ahead of its time. SUVs  made even in the last year, often don't have all of the options this 2004 has. Worth a test drive! Saying a lot for a 13 year old SUV. My f2f has the pearl paint and wheat leather interior. Still looks amazing! These SUVs  are tough!

infiniti,fx45,2004,twitter.com/370z, 12/04/2010,Great Used Car Value,4,"I purchased my 6yr old FX45 cash after selling my 350Z Roadster. Yes it reminds of sports car compared with an SUV, but if you own a sports car, don't think the FX will match it; it won't. The styling is polarizing, but I'm addicted to it, although now in 2010 it doesn't stand out like it did back in the day. I evaluated my purchase based upon proven Nissan reliability and longevity, bullet proof engine, purchase price vs. projected residual value when I sell; cost of taxes, registration and insurance; and available features comparable to new cars. I estimate that my cost to own for the next 5 years will be less than a tenth of what a new vehicle with similar features will be."
infiniti,fx45,2004,Rcrain420, 09/10/2009,Highly Recommended,4,"I am due for a new vehicle, I hate that I need a bigger vehicle or I would drive the FX until the wheels fall off. Drives great, performs great, looks great. A++ rating."
infiniti,fx45,2004,darkside80, 07/08/2012,FX45 Heaven,4,"I bought my FX45 used with 80k miles from a private owner and loved the car.
I did have to replace the front wheel hub, but other than that it was a joy to drive and very comfortable.
I loved the sound system and the unique exterior styling.
I test drove the FX35, but found the FX45 to be more sporty and had great performance.
Gs mileage is poor in both models though."
infiniti,fx45,2004,Fortune 50, 09/26/2015,SUV hotrod,4,"Style and performance are the forte' of this ride. It has loads of technology and aims to please the youthful buyers it attracts. It doesn't have the road presence of my much larger Yukon, but the trade off is easier parking, improved fuel economy, and better handling. The exhaust note is music to my ears with the right amount of V8 bark. It has generous seating for four adults and reasonable cargo space. The navigation is one of the best available. The dual climate control is first rate and the backup camera is essential due to poor rear visibility. Just mash the go fast pedal before you change lanes to be sure there isn't someone hanging out in the blind spots. Don't worry as it'll outrun, stop quicker, and out handle all but the absolute top performing car from each OEM. All that performance comes at the price of comfort. Premium materials help, but a sport oriented suspension will transmit bumps. Very communicative steering is far superior to the latest numb electronic steering units on newer cars. Parts are pricey as befitting a luxury brand, but the dealership experience is worth it.

The latest update on this bionic cheetah is that it never feels cheap. Construction and high quality materials hold up very well. You'll be hard pressed to find a more reliable vehicle. The required premium fuel is the cost of performance. This isn't of any real concern for the targeted affluent buyers. As mentioned earlier the maintenance is quite high with stock twenty inch wheels and performance tires, large capacity oil changes, and well hidden service items which lead to higher labor costs if you have the dealership perform the work and you will want them to do just that. Infiniti was thoughtful enough to place an inspection plate that allows you to check the condition of the difficult to change air filter which I strongly suggest you replace with a long lasting premium reusable one. With our high snow fall totals this year it was easy to see that Infiniti did there homework with the AWD. When driven responsibly it moved in the direction you asked it too without drama. Much better than the old mechanical unit in my newer Yukon with aggressive tires. Is there anything this vehicle can't do well? Bruce Wayne should drive one of these. The one down side of this vehicle isn't a fault, but is the result of it's well known performance which leads to every boy racer to rev his little engine at a stop light hoping that you will stoop to his level and demonstrate what's underfoot. It can be quite annoying. Just turn the volume of the wonderful radio up a tad bit and you'll quickly forget he's there. Ah peace at last.

The vehicle now has 118,500 and continues to impress. Several upgrades have been performed during normal maintenance further increasing its performance. The only issue is that the power door lock actuators are reluctant to cycle on very hot days. This is a well documented issue with a simple fix. Knowledgable enthusiasts cast envious looks with uncanny regularity. It's a shame Infiniti doesn't currently produce a V8 version of the G platform. Oh well guess I'll just have to hang onto this one.

With fourteen years of sun exposure I can say that the dash it starting to show small bubbles. This is a quality complaint that several have noticed; an expensive one as well. The HVAC mode actuator has failed which causes a very loud popping noise when the system wants to recirculate. This requires changing it to fresh air and diminishes the system output. The drivetrain is superb and still provides impressive performance. The look has trickled down to several small crossovers including the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio so it's still modern even if not keeping with the edgier designs from it's parent company Nissan.The rear reclining seats are enjoyed by passengers and helps as the seats are sport firm. If you can find a used one with low mileage
 then buy it after checking for abuse and the obvious cosmetics. It's a great alternative to a large SUV especially if you have a small family.

negotiated eventually for a fair trade

happy because I got the V8 a lot

Even though FX is 7 years old, performance and looks blows away newer cars today. About performance, this SUV moves and accurate. The 20"" wheels like to grabs on to the street however Goodyear stock tires are expensive. May have to look into Yokohama to save $$$$. In addition I just wished I bought it for the price suggested on Edmunds however dealers said no way. Anyway I paid a couple thousands more but wife and me are happy like a bee with FX!!!"
infiniti,fx45,2004,In Love with the 45, 04/04/2007,It's the 45 what more is there to say ?,4,"This vehicle is a beast, handles like a G35 coupe. I should know, I used to lease an 03 G35 coupe. It's the perfect balance of sports car/ SUV utility. Goes faster, and handles MUCH better than an SUV should. You won't be disappointed but you will be shocked at the cornering, and acceleration ability of this vehicle. The Technology Package is a must. Navigation, rear back up camera, and the ability to start the vehicle without having the key in the ignition just add so much value to this vehicle. It's also nice to know that there is about one Infiniti FX45 on the road for every 15 FX35s. "

than ALL SUVs on the road including 
the Porsche Cayenne Turbo which costs

SUV (the ML55 AMG) for $25k more, and 
not BMW's top-of-the-line SUV (the X5

looking for the utility of an SUV but 
don't want to give up the

I'm a big guy - 6'4', and I can have my seat totally comfortable with a 6' guy sitting right behind me. The car is fast, and corners and brakes like a sports car. People that know me ask how I could turn in a 911 for an SUV, and I say to them there's not that much difference! Of course the Infinity is no Porsche, but factor in the ability to carry five friends, AND all of thier luggage, and still feel like you're driving a sports car - for less than HALF the price, and it makes sense."

The vehicle is a dream, as it handles like a sports sedan.  The abundance of power provides frequent thrills, ride quality is superb, and the absence of road noise leaves me constantly wondering if I'm really in an SUV.  On top of all that, the vehicle is rock solid.  I recently completed a 1,100 mile round trip and averaged approx 18 mpg while driving at average speed of 75-80 mph between San Diego and Beaver, UT.

The FX has the best style and design of any SUV. The rear and front ends are masterpeices of design and the car is an engineering marvel. The ride is smooth, the power superb and the comfort supreme.  The one flaw is a lack of visibility in the rear window when parking..it takes awhile to determine the distance from a parked car...the rear-view camera would have been nice.  Reccomendations: Make the rear-view camera an option in itself, or make it standard on the FX; also fog lights should work with running lights.  Great car..I love it.  GCAssad"

That is a bit of an exaggeration, but it does handle like a nice sports sedan.  It is based on the G35 platform.  The interior of the car is nice though I would say the Lexus and BMW SUV's are nicer, but I didn't buy the car for the interior.. I did for the performance which this car definately has.  I highly recommend this vehicle for daily usage though the gas mileage is pretty poor but this is to be expected for a 4300 pound SUV with a 315 hp engine."

I had an FX35 and traded it in for the FX45 and have not regretted the decision at all.  Just remember, this car was not made to carry a ton of stuff or more than 4 adults.

Ride is a bit bumpy, but that is what you get with an SUV that is built on a sports car platform.  The only down side for me is the gas mileage. I have been getting between 15 and 17 mpg around town.  I was debating between the 35 and the 45, went with the 45 because it feels ""heavier"" when you drive it and the gas mileage is about the same (the V8 doesn't have to work as hard).

Great power, great torque and I love the engine ""note"".  The SUV really handles very well.  The compromise to the styling is a pretty small cargo area.

infiniti,fx45,2006,D. M. Weed, 10/04/2020,Buy This Super AWD Crossover,5,"I bought my FX45 in 2018 at a deep discount from the original MSRP: these are wonderful vehicles that have become affordable, especially considering that they are well built, reliable, and mechanically sound.  The quality of Nissan Corporation’s vehicles was deteriorating by 2006, but Infiniti engineered the FX45 to impeccable standards.

Some reviewers have called the ride harsh, but that statement is misleading.  To be sure, the ride does not cosset passengers in heavenly isolation from the road, but the balance between comfort and handling is excellent.  In fact, my favorite aspect of the FX45 is its handling: turn in is sharp, it has feline responsiveness, and it tracks true on the highway.  It’s ride and handling mirror its sporty pretensions, and it doesn’t ride like a truck.

I do have a few quibbles.  New parts from Infiniti are expensive: the company expects luxury buyers to pony up for parts.  On the other hand, the secondary market is sufficiently replete with used parts, so some diligence and tolerance for risk can save you thousands of dollars.

The interior is beautiful (mine has brick red trim and leather, which is particularly attractive), but the leather is a bit thin, and I have heard that the seat upholstery is prone to wear and tears.  Mine is holding up well, however, and I condition it regularly to try to keep it supple.

While the front doors close with a resounding thud, the rear doors clang, which is one of the few compromises to the overall luxury feel.  Maybe Infiniti scrimped on sound-deadening material to save weight, but closing the rear doors is the moment when the vehicle sends a cheap note.

The most serious annoyance is initial acceleration in a V8 that is otherwise strong and capable.  The vehicle can feel sluggish leaving stop signs and lights, and it wants to upshift quickly (I suspect that the transmission programming is the result of Infiniti trying to optimize gas mileage).  In other words, when I baby the throttle, the vehicle bogs.  More deliberate throttle input helps tremendously because the FX45 certainly has the power to move its weight.

None of these issues detracts much from the overall FX45 experience.  Everyone involved in the development, engineering, styling, and construction should be commended for making a striking and enjoyable vehicle.  It’s a gem that not everyone knows of, which makes it a tremendous bargain on a high value crossover.  It offers moderate cargo capacity and s sporty driving experience.  Infiniti succeeded at developing its “bionic cheetah,” and if you buy one, you likely won’t feel cheated.

infiniti,fx45,2007,Dave , 12/22/2006,What a blast to drive,4,The FX45 corners better than a lot of performance cars I've driven plus you can really hammer it in a corner and it will respond well...not slide out.

Best auto purchase ever made to give you a Big Bang for the buck! It has so much power and will literally fly. Mine does 0 to 60 in about 5 seconds and gets about 22 miles to the gallon, which was a pleasant surprise.  It feels as though the front end rises and takes offlike a bionic panther! This is an exciting, fun auto to drive that drives like a race car with the luxury of a higher end luxurious vehicle. Would recommend to anyone that wants luxury and excitement in one vehicle! It is a wonderful vehicle for a man or woman to drive. Fun for both!"
infiniti,fx50,2009,Infinti, 08/28/2008,Much Improved!,5,What a great vehicle. After testing 10 different SUVs in its class. I think the FX50 S has the most bang for buck as far as Technology and Power in a well put together package. I love the handling and I love all of the technological features you get with it. It also has the biggest wheels in its class as standard. If anyone complains about the ride against any other vehicle just remember that because all other those other rides have smaller rims and not low profile tires such as the this one. I think Infiniti is definitely heading in the right direction!!!! If added my suggested improvements you would without a doubt have a clear winner hands down!! The Infiniti FX50S is a must have vehicle!!
infiniti,fx50,2009,FXLover, 04/21/2010,FX50S is just amazing!,5,"I just love this car!  It's ultra fast, powerful and super fun to cruise with.

I ""liked"" the EX35, but never really ""loved"" it, and that always bugged me as it was not an inexpensive purchase. When I was in for my 1 yr 15,000 mile service I saw the FX50S on the lot in the same color interior combination as my EX35. I had no intention of trading up, but the car looked incredible. I threw what I thought was a ridiculous offer at the dealer, and two weeks later I was driving it off the lot. I could not be happier. The FX50S is EVERYTHING my EX35 was not, and I finally LOVE the vehicle I purchased. Technology, performance, comfort are all FAR above what I expected and for value, no other vehicle comes close."

immediately, I noticed that when accelerating from a slow roll,
there was a slight hesitation, then a jerk as the transmission engaged.
I took the car in several times, but nothing could be found.
The dealer finally told me that there was a tech bulletin on the issue, but no solution.
So I still live with that. About a 2 yrs ago, my Bluetooth started dropping out, or not hooking up, a real irritation since I use my car for business.
I took it in and was told that there is a problem with IPhone, Bluetooth and the car.
I am NOT happy with the lack of resolutions!"
infiniti,fx50,2009,Montgomery, 08/28/2008,Does It Again!,5,Once again Infiniti has outdone themselves! The styling in my opinion has been tweaked for the better! The new engine is very very REV happy! It pulls hard and strong! The new gauges and cockpit feels like youre sitting in a fighter plane! I love the manual paddle shifters. At first I didn't think i would like them but now I cant stop using them! The braking and handling is very very good even in the rain! Ive never felt so confident driving an suv at such high speeds before. This thing truly handles like a sports car!  The navigation is the coolest nav system I have seen to date even compared to most aftermarket ones! Its that good! The all around camera view is priceless! Well done Infiniti!

I was originally skeptical about the FX50 until a test drove one. It really is a beautiful car and I don't think pictures can really do it justice.  The interior and technology is really top notch.  Mileage is good for the power, but still quite a bit lower than the Q5, but what can I say... it may not be politically correct, but it is seductively fast.  Incidentally, my dealer experience was exceptional and it only ended up costing a few thousand more than the Q5 I was quoted.  Infiniti has a real winner with the FX50S."

Just received a free dash replacement from hundreds of bubbles. The speedometer was recalled, no charge. The biggest complaint, the vehicle does not hold a track. It pulls left. It has a lane departure warning that uses a camera to see the dividing lines on the road. If you cross a line without signaling, it beeps. Nice feature, however it should not have been installed in lieu of fixing the tracking problem."

The car does demand respect in traffic as it seems those who know tend to shy away from it, this car is fast! Brings us to next point, this is not a truck, should not be considered an SUV/CUV either. I wanted a sports car, but had trouble giving up the SUV height and utility. That is EXACTLY what you get with this model, an SUV sports car. If you are looking for off road capability and storage, forget the FX. If getting a little (not a lot) of attention and V8 power is your thing you wont be disappointed.

I am struggling with multiple roof issues for past 2 years, including rattling noise (now it makes noise even driving on interstates with perfect roads), irritating alarms, false coding on the sensors, timing disturbances of the motor mechanics etc. Its literally one after another. Contacted DOM service, and Infiniti consumer affairs, no real success. Seems like its a new technology for Infiniti and needs significant improvements."
infiniti,g-convertible,2011,Don Powell, 12/23/2016,A car you love to drive,5,"I bought the car due to Infiniti's reputation with engine performance and reliability.  For a convertible, it has a very comfortable ride.  Main issues are a rattling top - particularly when it's cold and the seals probably contract until the car heats up - and rear brakes that squeal after the car sits overnight and when you back up.  Probably a brake dust issue that can be resolved with dust covers.  The car is a blast to drive and actually comfortable on rides of over 100 miles.  I put it in storage for the winter months and bring it back on the road in April here in Massachusetts.  I would not advise driving it in winter conditions since it is not a four-wheel drive.  All controls are easy to use, including the navigation.

I had to pull over and have someone come and pick me up.

I am a big guy so the mid section area left to right when driving is a little tight, but workable. The engine's performance is great and I like the sound as well, but it does get a little rougher in the upper rev ranges. My other car is a Lexus GS350 and the Lexus engine is much more sophisticated, but no more powerful.  This is a very upscale car and does everything well. It has next to no trunk storage (the back seat area can hold lots of groceries if you need it), but that's not what it was built for! You can't go muddin' in it either, so get over it.

It's true, the trunk space is non-existent when the top is down and really not much when the top is up either but I didn't buy it for the trunk space.  The back seat can be utilized if really needed for a very short ride but works best for groceries if the top is down.  I use this car for my daily 20 mile commute with no complaints.  I love the sound of the engine, and surprised about the reviews lamenting it.  I was worried initially but my husband and I have fun driving it on the interstate, not sure what the issue was in the formal review.  Maintenance has been great, much cheaper than my VW EOS.

I get numerous compliments from little kids, all the way up to the Elderly!!  It had a better warranty than did BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar, which were considerably more expensive. Before purchasing this car, I did thorough research and found that the convertible top had been problematic from day one.  After seeing a significant reduction in those complaints for 2013, I thought that Infinity had fixed the problem.  Boy, was I wrong!  Just as others have stated, the top gets confused all too often.  An 80 mile drive to the nearest dealer is necessary to have them perform a procedure called ""Re-learn the top"".  Afterwards, the top functions fine for about a month, before faltering yet again.  How disappointing!!  This is really a beautiful and reliable car, otherwise!  It's not worth keeping, if I can't enjoy the ""top down"" experience.

infiniti,g-coupe,2011,Dexter Haven, 06/02/2017,"Reliable, looks good, performs well",4,"I bought this car certified pre-owned in 2104 with 28k miles. I canceled the dealer's extended warranty after a few days, which would have been a waste of $2,800, as I suspected. Since, it is now 2017, and I have not needed any repairs, other than new tires, which was my choice for a softer grip on the street. I didn't drive it for a few weeks and had to jump start it once. That was the only inconvenience, besides the battery on the keychain dying on me, and I almost got stranded, since they didn't tell me how to start the car with a dead fob. You take the key out of the underside, open the door manually, and insert the dead fob into the dashboard above your left knee. That should allow it to start. Then order a replacement battery on Amazon and install it yourself. It's easy to do and saves a trip to the dealer and some money.  One con: the car sits too low for me and offers a poor view of the street, compared to an SUV. Getting in and out is a pain. I'm 6'2"", though. I talked to a car guy who said the Infiniti lasts a long time. Other models I have seen here, like the Range Rover Evoque, seem to always break down. So the Infinit gives some peace of mind there. I might get a Nissan Rogue, though, to have a higher perch and more interior room. This G37x a sharp sports car, though.

I'm into cars that have style, power and luxury and the Infinity G-37S has it all and then some.  Moreover, it has a price point well below other makes in the same category.  None of my Infinitys have required anything more than oil and filter change over the last five years, except for a battery replacement.  Fuel consumption is close to 20 miles per gallon in town(where I mostly drive), which I don't think is bad for a 350hp car.  It's a real treat to drive a car with paddle shifters and be able to switch from drive to sport mode.

No significant complaints so far.
The acceleration is very good and the car handles well.
The interior is nice and it is comfortable (except for the rear seats, which are cramped).
Gas mileage isn't great, but I knew that when I bought the car.
Compared to a BMW 3 series (which is what I had and which I was considering buying again), the value of this car can't be compared.
It would've cost probably $15,000 more for a comparably equipped 335 BMW, and the Infiniti has a bigger engine (330 hp).
The manual transmission is smooth and has a very short movement, which is nice.
The Infiniti also uses standard motor oil, unlike the BMW."

Replaced the factory Yokohama's with Continental DWS 06 and the thing was a tank and that's with the sport package / 19"" wheels.

I was pleasantly surprised.
This is one of the few beautiful coupes that are still made.
It's a well build and layed out car.
When driven mildly, it's a well composed tourer.
When driven agressively, it provides a high level of confidence for the causal driver.

At it's heart is a long time award winning engine matched to a capable transmission.

If you're tire of performance vehicles that are great track machines, but harsh daily drivers, you owe it to yourself to take a test drive."
infiniti,g-coupe,2013,Alexander Leuser, 09/09/2020,Pros and Cons,4,"Pros: Like many others have said, the price to performance ratio is ridiculous. Very reliable, only a couple of problems over 70,000 miles of ownership. In my opinion the best looking car that you can buy for under $15,000. Expected to last until at least 125,000 miles, maybe 150,000. E46 M3 performance while spending $2,000 less per year in maintenance/repairs.

Cons: I cannot emphasize this enough, the dealer network is so soo bad. They are incapable of handling anything beyond routine maintenance. If you even ask for fully synthetic oil when you look at the receipt you will see that they neglected to do it. Girlfriend had an INFINITI and at the dealership they clearly backed her car into something and returned it without saying anything. Car has had a few reliability issues. A leak that resulted in the engine having to be pulled, this occurred sometime before 50,000 miles and was covered. Another issue, according to the dealer, was the brake switch failing resulting in the car not being able to accelerate above 35mph, resulting in a tow. Corporate said initially that they would reimburse for the rental car as the dealership had none available. When I called they said it was the dealerships responsibility and the dealership blamed corporate. Never was reimbursed. This was between 60,000-70,000 miles and was a relatively inexpensive fix <$300 but was NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY! Because of COVID the dealers have all had to return the majority of their loaner cars and are in an agreement with Enterprise. And not to sound like a Karen but originally when dropping off your car for service you would get to drive a brand new QX60, now be prepared for some real $#%+boxes, the latest was a Hyundai with a loud knocking sound above 65mph. There is a reason that they are talking about potentially discontinuing the brand.

The rear seats are not designed for anyone over the age of 10, but as long as the trip is not more than 2 hours, they will suffice. It’s a coupe, and the focus is on the cockpit.  Fuel economy is acceptable, but it is a trade off for the power. You really need to buy premium fuel- more than one mechanic has stated that it is still cheaper at the pump than at the service department.

infiniti,g-coupe,2013,WM, 08/16/2017,DONT BUY THESE CARS!,1,"My car was 2 years old and got 2 smaller rust spots that bubbled the paint then came through. It had a very large rust spot on  the door. I took it to the dealer to have it covered under the warranty, after I couldn't reach anyone. They blew me off till the warranty expired and acted like they didn't know I brought the car in even though i had their info and business card. Finally i went on social media and got an instant response. I took the car back in and now they say that the rust was caused by the roads. How does it bubble from under the paint then come thru if it was a chip. Infiniti just lost a customer for life, and to think I was going to buy another one. Now the car is worthless just like their warranty.

infiniti,g-coupe,2013,G37sdiva , 11/16/2020,Lookin' Good and Haulin' Ass!,5,"I currently own a black, 2013 G37s Journey Coupe IPL, and I loved it the moment I saw it on the Infiniti showroom floor. It’s so much fun to drive because with staggered tires, it hugs the road when cornering at a higher speed without skidding. In the pouring rain, it handles 85 mph no problem and it plows through puddles, no losing control or hydroplaning whatsoever. It stops on a dime and when you punch it, it takes off like a rocket! It is pricy when it comes time to change the tires as, because they aren’t rotated, the rear tires are a unique size, and the compound is softer, they wear a lot faster than the standard tires (about every 24,000 mi). I am on my 3rd set and replacement for all 4 runs approx. $1600+, not including balance and alignment. But, for the handling, it’s totally worth it because it feels secure. Considering it’s a sport vehicle, it’s excellent on gas. The only drawback is the paint. It’s softer and being black, it scratches very easily. I have a ceramic coating on it however, if you don’t get it done right away, you’ll get chips on the hood within the first week driving it, like me. Unfortunately, I wasn’t aware of the delicacy, nor did I know about ceramic coatings. Also, the angling of the windshield and being lower to the ground, the windshield gets chipped easily. There’s plenty of trunk space. It can fit 11 paper bags full of groceries. The seats are incredibly comfortable because both driver and passenger sides adjust to contour around you for total support. They are heated, when needed, temperature and dual controlled, as well. AC is provided in the back; skirted airbags front and back; total Bose surround sound system; standard GPS and Bluetooth in dash; push button start; heated mirrors; garage door/gate programmable rear mirror; rain sensor wipers. The only thing missing are winged doors. But it’s the best car I’ve ever bought! I’m a very happy G37s owner, I think you would be too!

infiniti,g-sedan,2011,Tony, 04/05/2016,Japanese BMW,5,"After only owning cars from Germany and growing tiresome of the excessive maintenance cost that came with them I decided it was time for a change. Actually I was forced to change anyways due to the fact that a careless motorist killed my BMW 328xi. I wanted either a Lexus or an Infiniti for the fact that it would no longer cost me a fortune to repair or maintain those vehicles. I make 1 hour trips to and froe college and require a comfortable vehicle that I can rack up many harmless miles on. The Infiniti does not disappoint. But I must say that fuel economy isn't to much better that my BMW with a bigger engine. Also I feel obligated to mention that the cup holders are a joke and I hate them so so much! And I don't much care for the cheap hard plastics located by the steering column, should not be expected out of a 40000 dollar vehicle. But that is all the problems with my Infiniti, but I'm just nick picking the best I can, the list of complaints is much smaller than my Beamer. It also has much more space when really it's only a foot longer than the BMW. The BMW feels faster but the Infiniti is by no means a slouch. The ride quality is so much more refined in the Infiniti and it's also quieter inside the cabin. If your looking for quality, dependability, reliability, and the most value for your dollar, and inexpensive running cost with style and elegance. This is the car for you.

infiniti,g-sedan,2011,kstout, 08/04/2016,Avoid This Car Like the Plague,1,"I enjoyed this car until one day it broke down by what I was told was a ""rare occurrence"" which turns out to be a known issue with ALL Nissan/Infiniti cars. The transmission leaked fluid into the cooling system which damaged everything the mixed fluids came into contact with and totaled the car. Despite the fact that this is a manufacturer defect and known issue (internally) they refused to fix it because I was slightly out of warranty. I always serviced the vehicle regularly, drove responsibly, and even cleaned it weekly! After consulting with a dozen mechanics who specialize in Nissan/Infiniti, I've been informed that this issue goes back to an early 2000's model Pathfinder and Nissan refuses to recognize it publicly or help anyone who has lost their car because of a defect they are responsible for. Don't take my word for it, just do some searching online and you will see that this particular model and many other Infinitis with the 7AT transmission are notorious for problems. Like I said, it would be an enjoyable car if it actually worked, but I wouldn't advise anyone to risk their hard-earned money on this vehicle or a brand that refuses to take care of their customers.

infiniti,g-sedan,2011,yoda4, 02/10/2011,I Like It - Very Much,4,"2 months in so far. This car is great. The ride and handling are awesome; the ride is firm but comfortable. Hard core power-heads will want the 3.7L, but I find the 2.5L to offer excellent power. I wish it did not require premium gas. I understand that this allows Nissan to achieve higher peak hp, but the peak hp folks are buying the 3.7L, so...

I am not totally blown away by the styling. Other contenders were BMW and Mercedes. I like the looks of both of those better, but horror stories about reliability and repair costs ruled them out. Style is very personal, and many will disagree, but I prefer a more traditional, angular style. Despite that, I bought this car and I am very happy."
infiniti,g-sedan,2011,johnx2011g37, 09/22/2011,Confident: G37 Sedan is Definitely a great purchase!,5,"Before making my decision on G37 Sedan, I carefully researched BMW 335i, Audi A4, Lexus IS350, the G37 Coupe (330HP). My pricing range is in between 35K - 45K. After test drove all these cars, I have to choose G37 sedan because it's a mix of quality and stylish and power. Most importantly, you could feel the car has built very solid,
the engine makes you feel powerful, and confident on the street. While 335i has twin turbo but unfortunely tons of problems. Both A4 and IS350 lack of power. The G37 Coupe version is nice, but it's a bit heavier than the Sedan. also only 2 HP more than the sedan, I would recommend you getting Sedan not only I have one, but it's a better value by far."

Now just within the past month, I've had to bring it back to the dealer twice. Once for the chrome trim peeling on the center console lid and then again for a rattle in the dash/ rattle in front passenger door and broken cupholder. Once again, the dealer did all work covered under warranty.

Handling was a little sharper than the S60 and power is effortless.

The 218 hp engine is adequate enough however it is noisy when accelerating. I feel the exterior is a little boxy looking however I had the dealership add a painted pinstripe which was on the showroom model and it seems to help the appearance in my opinion (just a matter of taste I guess). I like the unique color called 'Blue Slate' which is a combination of blue/grey depending on the light of day. The standard '6' speaker sound system is fine. The interior is first rate and mine had come with the dealer installed wood trim rather than the aluminum which I found added a richness to it.

Accelerates briskly, especially in DS or manual mode, but not a land rocket like the G37. EPA rates it only a mile or two per gallon better in fuel economy, but in real life driving I am getting around 24 mpg in the suburbs, while my friends with G37's get around 16-17 mpg. So we are talking around a 7-8 mpg improvement over the G37, which is like a 40-50% improvement. Handles and corners beautifully and is the first car I have owned that is actually fun to drive. Interior and exterior are classy and well designed. Base stereo is fine, don't understand unavailability of Bose upgrade and Navi system. Seats are very comfortable."

Greatly disappointed in the engine and transmission.
Transmission seems to take forever to decide what gear to go into.
Gas mileage has averaged 17.2 mpg over the 3500 miles I have driven, half interstate and half suburban.
Engine is very weak and combined with the transmission you never know when the acceleration will start.
Last three cars were 2008 AUDI A4 Quattro, 2006 BMWX3 and a 2004 Bmw 325i.
This Infiniti does not compare at all with the driving pleasure of these cars."

Was wanting a 4 door performance sedan and was considering the Audi S4 but it was $60k after adding the options I wanted. Looked at the G37 and found practically everything I wanted in the S4 for $16k less. Powerful engine, nice interior, and I love the Limited Edition's exterior color, Black Malbec, essentially black until you get it in the sunlight where it is dark maroon to purple although the Monacco red leather seats can be polarizing (I love 'em!). It does seem that I see G37s everywhere though - very popular vehicle. I wish it were a little more ""rare"" but this vehicle is a great value and a lot of people realize this."

At the same time the ride is well composed and smooth.

Interior quality is good but not great. Its about on par with my VW GTI in terms material quality for the dash and all the nobs. The fake wood ook good but I've seen better. Leather is fine, but again not the best. Layout is very logical though.

Interior room is also fine, but a little less that I expected for a vehicle this size. Considering the my other car, a VW GTI, which is some 20 in shorter has nearly as much front and backseat room...

The power, sportiness, and the ergonomics could not beat for the price.  I also test drove the Acura TL and the Lexis IS 350 and still the G 37 stood tall.  I am very happy with my purchase.

I love driving it and have to fight the temptation to step on the gas.  Handling is excellent (ride is firm, as expected).  I picked the G37 over another A4 because of 1) performance, and 2) I am hoping that the Infiniti will require fewer repairs than the A4.  With that said, I learned that the cost of scheduled maintenance (vs repairs) is not cheap for the Infiniti.  Ask the Dealer about this before you buy.

Not safe when you're on the highway and attempting to pass another vehicle. This car has the potential to leave you hanging for several seconds while it searches and eventually engages.

MPG's were not the best and some road/wind noise.
Recently stepped into a 12 G37xS.
Even though they look similar, a lot of smaller improvements to make car even better.
I am also avg. 3mpg better doing same drive.
Writing this for anyone looking for a great used car value that appreciates sporty sedan vs. a Camry/Accord.
Probably still the best overall value in a 4dr. sports sedan with AWD.
Road/Wind noise improved on G37 and much quieter on Hwy. with 7spd auto vs 5spd as engine revs are lower.
Suspension seems better over bumps vs. G35 and more solid.
Steering lightened up some at low speeds vs. G35.

***update*** still have the car.  Anytime I look at something to buy I keep the G.  While not the largest or most practical, it still seats four adults comfortably, get pretty decent mpg and is bullet proof on reliability.  I have had zero issues with car on 60k of miles.  Any Nissan dealer can service these cars too.  I routinely get 27mpg on highway at 75mph which I think is great for a 328hp AWD car.

You can stream music from your phone without pluging it in (love it) flip through the songs on your phone, look at your address book on the dislay, control it all with your hands on the wheel.

The car learns how you drive and starts to shift accordingly. This car has power, handles great and is very comfortable. I took this on a road trip last summer from the Atlanta area to New England where a couple of things really stood out. First, this car is very comfortable, even after 6-7 hours behind the wheel. Gas mileage? My roundtrip include driving through NY (north and west of NYC), in Boston, the White and Green Mountains. All told, I drove close to 3,200mi and kept all gas receipts so I could calculate mileage. I ended up at north of 31mpg!!

infiniti,g-sedan,2012,Chuck, 10/21/2015,A Refined Sports Car that's affordable,4,"Previously owned a 2003 e39 BMW and made the switch to Infiniti after that car was totalled by a reckless driver. A lot of what drove me to the G in particular was it's similarities to my prior car, RWD (the G37x is RWD unless you're slipping, then AWD), power, a non-CVT transmission, and refinement. I like the AWD capability if I need it, but really enjoy receiving my power from the back end the majority of the time. Car will not slip in the rain no matter how hard you damper the pedal in AWD only mode. Had moderate snow last year, it plows through even with old tires.

The G so far for me has been a pleasure to own. After working out some kinks that were covered under warranty, I have yet to spend a dime outside of oil and filter changes. Warranty eventually covered a leaking bank of my VCGs, but that's nearly regular maintenance. I did pay for a belt change, which should be the only time I needed to do this for the next 5-7 years. I may need a new bearing, but it will be covered under my remaining CPO powertrain warranty. Overall, nothing out of the ordinary. The dashboard does have a bit of a rattle at times which is likely anecdotal, and one thing I've noticed with mine that's happened to others is a whistling wind noise at 85+ mph depending on the wind resistance. Rather annoying two sounds that don't affect the performance, reliability, but do hamper the enjoyment a bit at times. The car however is now nearing 6 years old with nearly 70k miles, so some cleanup on those two issues is likely warranted.

I bought it with 44k, currently has 68k. I have many 3-4 hour trips and a 12 hour ride on the odo so far, along with daily commute.

Everything is great outside of very low speed bumper to bumper traffic.  The 7spd transmission is a bit cumbersome at very low speeds (0-15mph) during traffic. The cabin and driver's position really lends you to feel confident driving it. Great visibility, and the feedback on the wheel allows you to ""feel"" the road. The steering is crisp and has great radius. The weight of the car causes a bit of ""rolling"" in corners, but I upgraded to sportier all season tires (in lieu of some softer/plusher all seasons) and it nearly eliminated roll, even at 80+ mph. In an emergency situation while traveling 70mph, I had to jam on the brakes and even while sliding I felt in full control (made it out of that situation just fine, there was a huge blown out truck tire in the road I didn't see until I was right in front of it). I could be 300lbs and 6'4 and feel comfortable in the car. Currently 220 and 6'2. I'd say the car fits 4 comfortably, without the rear passengers sacrificing any leg room. 

Main downside is the 7spd transmission. In regular D mode, it will ride in high gears to save fuel. You can use the SD mode or full sport mode for manual changing that eliminates this issue.

Overall, the value is the best aspect on the car for what you're getting. The power, interior, exterior, options (when purchased used), are all accounted for for the least cost. Couple sacrifices being the torque rating, engine noise at high revs, build quality (don't confuse with engine reliability). Build quality can be seen in the door panel fastening, seat fastening/flimsiness, and materials used. As a tip, A couple I looked at gave off a rather strong oil smell from under the hood with very few miles, which led me to believe a lot of the used cars weren't broken in properly (manual states driver must not exceed 4k rpm during first 4k miles). Generally, the used sport models were beat up, at 35k miles and above. This could have been somewhat related to them sitting on the lot, but either way, the one I settled on didn't have this problem.

Some caveats: Tons of different options and packages and the pricing was not very indicative of what options the car was sold with, so it paid to do homework on what I wanted. I was looking
 for all the options outside of sport model, as it was more aesthetic changes than anything else (the sport model had slightly larger brakes, which results in higher bills when they need to be replaced). The premium package (including sun roof), and 18"" wheels were a must, I don't like the 17"" wheels for some reason even though they are only an inch smaller. Also I feel the wood grain interior is a must as the aluminum didn't seem to match the rest of the vehicle IMO.

People may say this car has road noise, but it is because of the OEM tires. Replace them right away. What is great about this car over its competitors is that it is not numb. You can tell details of the surface the car is on. You can feel it in the wheel and pedals. You don't want a car that is numb (BMW, Lexus etc.), unless you are driving in the city a lot, in which it's pointless to have a 3.7L V6 engine. So, the transmission isn't super smooth and F1-like in it's shifting speed. I like to feel when the car shifts. The G is a higher performing Maxima that looks better."

Not a fan of the 7speed transmission; would perform much better with a CVT like the Maxima has.

The car looks great but driving is a chore.
Steering requires effort, engine noise will wake the dead.
Everyone thought the car had an exhaust leak.
Transmission is horrible - difficult to launch smooth.
Gas mileage is around 22 combined.

It misses the mark in luxury by neglecting amenities found in competitors, such as cooled seats, front sensors (only has rear), rain sensing wipers, wood steering wheel.

On trips longer than 30 minutes it is not comfortable and the cabin is very cramped.
No wonder they stopped making this car.

We ended up turning the car in early and paying the last 8 months without having the car - that's how bad it got.  In retrospect, I would have transferred the lease to another person with 12 months to go which would have saved quite a bit of money.

This has been fixed in latest Q series.  The rear seat should fold down similar to Audi's, the luggage area is small with the shock towers and folding rears seats would help; this has not been modified in later models; c) the twist switch for the headlights on the directional stalk twists to easily and lights get turned when hitting the stalk-also fixed in later models.

so the car surges forward on downshifts (3->2 especially). The seats are nicely shaped but somewhat hard on the bottom - the heater element might be the cause.

Every once in awhile I have something large and it will not fit in the trunk and I have to put towels down in the back seat and try to fit items in that way.  I wish it had a post to connect my phone to play music.  You only have USB ports and no audio plug which the USB ports are a little difficult to get to being within the arm rest.

"
infiniti,g-sedan,2013,Pattison Vidal, 11/21/2019,A Japanese Charger R/T which can handle better!,5,"...and last longer.
I bought my 2013 Infiniti G37 Journey Sedan 7AT 9 months ago. This review will be 50% ownership experience and 50% buyers guide.
My particular G is equipped with the smallest wheel & tire setup 225/55 R17 on 7.5"" wide all corners. However, it handles extremely well in corners. There is little body roll when turning. It stops even better than it turns, and better still is the acceleration. Because of the high MAX hp rpm the car may feel deceptively lazy when cruising. But under heavy load you feel it pull harder and harder as you climb towards the Redline. I have discovered that you can drive the car in one of six combinations. D, DS, and M are the three transmission modes each can be used with or without Traction/Stability. Three transmission modes and two ECU modes. In D (TCS on), the car looks for the smoothest gear based on your throttle and speed but will still downshift if you floor it and shift at redline. I call it, ""wife mode."" IMPORTANTLY, the ECU will restrict power delivery below 3000 rpm and make your acceleration slower but smoother. In D with TCS off, the car changes. This toggle will change both the transmission attitude and power restriction. The car will shift at the same points but accelerates harder and shifts rougher (intentionally ;). Significantly less smooth but quicker. In DS (TCS on) the transmission logic changes. I call it, ""BMW mode."" TCS on still restricts the power delivery, and the shifts are still smooth. Gears are held longer so you get a smooth ride with just more engine and exhaust notes. The most notable difference is the rev matching and corner gear hold. Yes, rev matching!! So, in this mode, at a certain, ""high,"" braking input the transmission will downshift aggressively and rev match in the process. You barely feel engine braking. when going around a turn the car will not shift up. TCS off in this mode increases the level of engine braking you feel and SIGNIFICANTLY increases the aggression level of the transmission and engine. To put it in perspective, most G37 owners do not enjoy back road cruising in DS because, even at low throttle inputs, the car will hold low gears when going around corners. M mode is manual operation of the 7 speed AT. (With the Sport Model you get paddle shifters, leg support, larger wheels 18 - 19"", and better brakes. The sport trim and 6MT trim can be noticed by a more aggressive front bumper. M mode is different than D mode. All downshifts initiate rev matching by the ecu, but shift time is slower. I assume that the reason is that you are commanding the shift at random intervals instead of the transmission carefully timing them. Furthermore, the car will rarely allow an upshift below 2000 rpm. You will find M mode to be jerky when compared to D even with TCS on. With TCS off in this mode, passengers may think that your car has zero luxury aspirations since almost every shift will be a rough abrupt one. In my opinion, you should avoid this mode. I know that was allot of information. I can talk for hours about this car. Tires, brakes, oil changes are all the maintenance you'll do regularly. There are a few cool tech features. You can choose how long your lights stay on after you turn the car off. You can choose to have the steering wheel and chair adjust automatically for entry and exit. You can disable the parking sensor or change the range of warning. Both front windows are auto down. You can use the key to open all windows and sun roof. Fog lights have an independent switch. Some G sedans have adaptive cruise control indicated by a second button below the cruise control on/off button. If I could go back to my shopping time, I would have looked specifically for a RWD Sport trim. [contact info removed]

infiniti,g-sedan,2013,Steve, 05/24/2018,Amazing car!... If you're not fuel conscience.,4,"I have greatly enjoyed this car.  VERY good AC and heat (Heated seats do wonders in the winter time).  Controls and technology easy to navigate through and access to tech is very ergonomical.  I've heard that some complain about engine noise from the cabin but really it's not that bad.  If you find comfort in quiet drives, this car will still do it for you as the engine really only gives off a low hum or 'purr'.  The V6 is awesome.   MORE than enough power for any tight pinch, and still decent on gas.  The downside is that this car TAKES PREMIUM FUEL as this is a performance engine.  Due to this, it can be scary at the pump.  With premium gas currently around $3.60/gal, expect to pay approx $60 per fill up (18 gal tank).  I had a total of 2hr/day commute and was spending roughly $400 a month for gas which was really hurting. However, I was getting 26-27mpg due to all the highway miles.  Also, value drops surprisingly quickly for such an awesome car.  Bought at 201k last year.  1 year and 30k miles later,  i'd be lucky to get 14k for it.  Other then that, If you have a much shorter commute this car is p e r f e c t.  I'd buy again if my commute was shorter.

infiniti,g-sedan,2013,D. Hill, 10/16/2015,A Journey of a Thousand Smiles Begins,5,"I purchased an upscale 2013 Infiniti G37 Journey Sedan about 12 months ago with the Navigation and Premium packages that is a real pleasure to own and drive. Competitive Sports Sedan Cars are appealing and offer options that others wish for, but BMW, Lexus, Audi, or Mercedes-Benz have similar size and features.  Edmunds reviews this sedan as a pretty compelling luxury sport sedan, with caveat that up against newer, more recently updated rivals, it isn't as appealing as it once was... I used Edmunds along with other sites to help make the car selection process easy.  I sold my 2008 G35X Sedan with options to offset the price at sale. Beyond the personal choices you make, depreciation is the largest TCO driver.  So I’d consider the makes, trims and package options, then choose or trade-off to comment on anything that is new and costs over $40K must be questioned as to why you need that or why it matters.  The Infiniti Q50 Sedan as new and similarly configured would be at least $5-10K more, but some of the technology was not for me.

infiniti,g-sedan,2013,paul, 12/18/2018,Best choice I could have made,5,"I was looking for a good performing, comfortable sedan with a manual tranny. (That narrows selection considerably.) I purchased this new with the navigation package. It now has 97K plus miles of spirited driving with zero problems. Maintenance has consisted of oil changes (I use synthetic), tires, and brake pads. There have been no mechanical or electronic problems. One note - the S model came with summer high performance tires and it was undriveable in snow. I replaced them with all season high performance and the problem was gone. It's very comfortable on long trips. The motor has a wide torque band so even in bumper to bumper traffic you can put it in 2nd and go without shifting. Braking is exceptional for a sedan - credit the larger discs that come on the S (Don't confuse the S with the SX which has smaller 17"" wheels and doesn't have the larger brakes.).  Handling is very good. And the power is great! I was thinking about a BMW but this one performs as well, has been more reliable and cost about three quarters of what a bimmer optioned the way I'd want would have cost. It's been a great car and I'll be keeping it for a while.

The infotainment was very outdated and lacked blue tooth streaming and auxiliary cord (which is a deal-breaker for my next car); these features are standard with the Navigation package.

The engine, naturally aspirated, doesn't have much giddy until you reach the power bands, but the stock SR20DE engine responds very well to modifications. My G20 has held up beautifully over the years and I have had to turn down quite a few offers from people looking to purchase it from me. The multi-link design suspension which is similar to that of the Nissan 300ZX and Skyline GT-R has proven to be excellent under severe weather conditions.  "

it up-this car is great to traverse 
down the mountain, but don't expect 
performance on the way up! The car 
really has terrific handling and a 
smooth shifter. Infiniti did a nice job 
on the features/interior comfort. I 
purchased snows, handled great in 
winter. This car is meant to travel 
about 60-75MPH, but really works at 
higher speeds. It's got respectful 
pickup from 0-60. It's just the faster 
speeds or when you have more than 2

No rattles, squeaks or electrical gremlins that plagues other cars its age - a true testament to the engineering and build quality of Infiniti.  Simply put this is the best car I have ever owned and I still get compliments on it 9 years later.

I average almost 30 mpg year round in mixed driving.  Of course, I have a manual which goes a long way towards solving any perceived power deficiencies. Infiniti missed the boat with this car.  They should have given it some upgrades and put either a turbo or the 2.5 engine in it.  If you can find a nice one used, grab it.  You won't regret it."

It's now seven years and 160ks later and it still feels and drives like a new car!  I'm astounded at how tight and rattle-free the driving experience still is. We have repaired O2 sensors and wiper arms under warranty, changed tires and brake pads, replaced the power antenna, and changed a couple of  light bulbs.  That is all and the car drives like new,  I am not kidding!!  The original re92 bridgestone tires were awful in snow and ice but lasted 90k until they were taken off and thrown as far away as possible!  This car should never have come with those tires as standard equipment!"

Infiniti paid a lot of attention to details despite it not being a luxury car. Look, it is a 4-cylinder, so you aren't going to get the V-6 effort, but you do get good gas mileage, and the engine isn't that bad. What you are getting is a practical car that has some very nice features that practical cars don't always pay attention to. It is only 150 lbs lighter than my 1999 Camry and it is a smaller vehicle...I like the extra ""weight"" feeling.  Love the car, and hope it works for several more years.  I really like the side and behind profile, but the front seems rather ordinary."

were the wonderful seats, stability and performance at highway speed, all 
optional features I wanted were standard except for heated seats which my 
salesman got on a swap with another dealer, beautiful Bose stereo, price 
$7K below the lowest of the others, and the best warranty and dealer 
service. Nice little surprises were a cargo net, a leather holder for CDs, really 
nice millenium jade metallic paint and 30+ mpg on regular fuel."

 and have experienced the same driving pleasure as with my 1994 that I put
160K miles on.  A 5 spd manual is a must due to the 150HP 4 cylinder 
engine.  Pick-up from a dead stop isn't fantastic to due the 150HP 4 cyl,

infiniti,g20,2002,taenean, 07/14/2009,Gem of a Car!,5,"Why get a Civic, Lancer, or Corolla when you can get a G20? With the G20, you get much more for your dollar - power windows, power mirrors, leather interior, moonroof, etc. People will argue that the G20 has a low resale value compared to the other models. Who cares? If you want to get an affordable used car that you intend to use for many years to come, resale value does not matter. All you should care about is reliability and in that area, the G20 is a real keeper. I'm not being biased, but I read so many great things about the G20's SR20DE engine. I dare say that the SR20DE is tougher than the competitors' engines. And since the G20 is built in Japan, no need to worry about quality."

As this is my first car, I didn't think I would be able to afford this nice of a car. The only problems I have had with the car are: the power antenna, and the stock rims being bent. 2 months after the purchase of the car, I blew a tire on the highway because of the rims. Replaced the rims and tires with more sporty ones and everything was good. About a week ago, my ABS light came on and my rear breaks locked up. I took it to the mechanic and had to replace the calipers, and break pads. The exhaust needs to be replaced, but I am holding off until after winter. The only thing the car needs is a bracket for the muffler"

economy is more important, one can't 
complain!) Only problem I've had is a

infiniti,g20,2002,JKWright, 06/23/2004,G20 Sport - nice little car!,4,"We bought a silver '02 Sport model with
the 5-speed transmission for my wife.
It's been a flawlessly reliable,
good-looking, fun-to-drive little car. 
I owned a '91 Nissan Sentra SE-R for 10
years, a car that had the same SR20DE
engine in the G20. That engine was the
number one reason we looked into the G.
It's that good: easy to rev, torquey
down, not too buzzy, sips fuel and
breathes well all the way to redline.

The suedelike perforated inserts in the
Sport package really dress up the
interior along with the titanium-
colored accents. The 16"" wheels from 
the European Primera are a massive 
step up in appearance from the stock 
dinky wheels rounded with skinny 
rubber."
infiniti,g20,2002,FrogMan, 10/17/2004,G20 a Great Buy,4,"I'd recommend a G20 to anyone looking 
for a dependability.  Parking traffic 
can be problems in Chicago, so I was 
wanted a luxury car that was small and 
easy on the gas.  Reliability of this 
model was at top of the charts. I 
considered Saab & Volvo, but bought the 
G20 when I noticed a lot of the same 
safety design elements-Infiniti could 
do more to market the safety. 
Acceleration is the best w/Auto Trans, 
but the handling is fabulous (I also 
owned a Porsche 928).  This car is a 
sleeper - make no mistake, it is a 4 
cyl. built on an economy car platform.  
But it is probably the most luxury you 
can get for a car its size; e.g., 
liquid filled engine mounts) It drives 
like a much larger vehicle!"
infiniti,g20,2002,James Gallagher, 07/31/2006,Very Happy,5,"I bought this car used for my wife to drive, but whenever I can I take it for a joy ride.It handles magnificently on the highways and is just fantastic on winding roads. The overall quality built into every component in this sporty machine is supurb. Example,very high quality carpet material used for the floor mats. I also love the Bose sound system, again top quality stuff. The Infiniti powertrain warranty is another great feature also, although I have had no need to use it, knowing it is covering  the powertrain system up to 70,000 miles is comforting. This car has a great sporty look both inside and out.I really can't find any faults with our Infinity G-20. We both love our G-20!!!!!!!!!   "
infiniti,g20,2002,moparmaniac101, 11/30/2007,Beyond Reliable Machine,4,"Over 75k miles and not a single repair or service procedure except for routine oil and air filter changes and one transmission fluid flush. Reliability is flawless. SR20DE engine has only a meager 145-hp on tap unlike its gutsy G35 offspring, but returns exceptional fuel mileage. At $3.19 a gallon, it takes only $40 to fill up. Acceleration is adequate, 0 to 60 mph around 9.5 seconds. While it won't win you any pink slips against a Mustang GT, it effortlessly revs to its redline for stomp-on-it launches and is eager to play when you want to."
infiniti,g20,2002,G20 owner - 11 years, 06/09/2003,Best car NO ONE has ever heard of!,4,"While it is true that horsepower may be 
a little less than what many people 
want it to be, but don't believe 
everything you hear.  145HP is fine for 
a car its size.  I've owned 2 G20's 
since 1992 and still do.  OUTSTANDING 
car.  A consumers magazine rated it the 
most reliable car 5 YEARS IN A ROW!  
Other drivers think you have some sort 
of exotic car, but you really have a 
great looking, reliable, and fuel 
efficient Nissan.  It's about 4/5ths 
the size of an Accord or Camry.  If you 
don't need that little bit of space - 
you need to look at the G20.  You'll be 
glad you did."
infiniti,g20,2002,angelperez3, 05/28/2014,trash car,2,"I bought this car seven months ago with 103k miles. In seven months I have spent about $3,00 in this car.

infiniti,g20,2002,Dave C, 10/17/2008,Great Value for Sport Compact,4,"For almost 1 year I have been driving my G20 and I love this car. It's the perfect blend of sportiness, luxury, safety, and performance. I was looking for a 4 cyl sedan with curb appeal and safety in mind, and it came down to either the Accord or the G20. I'm very happy with my choice. 4 airbags, great looks, giant trunk - who could go wrong. I do hear a few squeaks and rattles now and then, and it would be nice if there was more sound dampening inside (you can hear outside road noise fairly well at high speeds). Cupholder is a change tray only. Check engine light came on at 74K miles, was rear O2 sensor.  Overall this is an excellent car."
infiniti,g20,2002,klejman, 07/20/2002,The Great Sleeper,5,"I purchased the car with 14,000 km in 
early 200 (your set up does not permit 
year 2000 to be entered), and it has 
been flawless since. It is invisible to 
law enforcement, loves both winding 
roads and highway cruising speeds.
I have put almost 190,000 km on it and 
have had no problems. A bit more power 
would be great. I will certainly be 
looking at the new Infiniti's coming 
out as I plan to replace this car in a

college and had to leave it behind and 
now I love it.  Ours is limited edition

discontinued that color or maybe not 
for us since we haven't seen another in 
our town. We get more inquiries about 
where we got that color.  It drives 
great, no problems in the year plus 
we've owned it.  A little more HP would 
be nice, but it's very comfortable and 
fun to drive.  All of my daughter's

$30K car, not."

but for a 4-cylinder this car has some 
power! All in all, I like the car and 
feel like it was a good investment.  
We also had a wonderful experience 
with the Infiniti dealer, something

a better price and value than the 
Honda Accord."

The only complaint I have is the quality of the leather.  At 2+ years, my seats starting cracking (I am not overweight, nor do I have kids).  Granted, the pick-up of the car lacks some, but I find the tradeoff for gas economy worth it.  I bought the car mostly because it was nice, affordable and great stereo and sun roof!

My 2002 g20 ran for 10,000 prior to discount and only had 48000 miles.  Great buy"

Great smaller sedan w/ performance. Fast & Drives well. Since purchased I've had the change timing belts, brakes, spark plugs, tires & the camshaft sensor. I guess the camshaft sensor is notorious for going out on Nissan's. Found a local shop that changed it for $180 w/ OEM parts. All of these are expected routine maintenance. IF YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR VEHICLE, IT WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.  It shifts smooth and has a lot of power when you step on the pedal. Fuel economy is okay, I get about 180 miles per tank fill, all city driving for me. I've heard these cars can go over 200k miles. I've seen an ad in our local Infiniti dealer with the same year/make/model that has 255k miles on it!

I purchased mine in October 2002, so it was one of the first G35 coupes sold in my state. It was amazing to drive such a head turner back then, and I love it still.

Every time I see it, I recognize again how beautiful it is. I do take care where I park, etc., so it is pristine. Yes, I've had some electrical issues (A/C - stereo control, windows), but for a 9 year old car with 86K miles, it's been a good value. Love my 2003 G35 coupe!"

Yes, having a car like this comes with a cost. Tires are certainly one of them along with the periodic window motor/regulator.

But on my way to look at it, I stopped to look at the G35 sitting next to it. I really loved the sports sedan look and feel of the car. And once I drove it, I was sold. From the one touch up & down features of each window to the auto to manual stick, this car easily fulfilled my wish list!

I was looking for a reasonably priced car that was sporty and still had a lot of luxury features.
My list included the Acura TL, Lexus IS and BMW 3 series.
I chose the Infinity mostly based on price.
It does have great looks and your not likely to have to pay blue book for one.
However, there is a reason for this.
These cars feel really cheap.
My wife has a 2004 Lexus RX 330 thats one year newer and about 8K less miles.
These cars were close to the same price, but the quality is like night and day.
The bose stereo system does sound very good and it is fun to drive.

1. Brakes - they wear out quicker than most cars and are expensive.

2. Radio/AC malfunction in most models is a costly dealer repair.

3. Some oil leak issues are common

4. Self repairs are not easy for this model, replacing the battery and headlights etc.

number of trips with 2 kids, wife, 
grandma and myself.  I am a former 
owner of 525-touring and it is 
apparent that the g-35's rear seats 
offer more room and comfort than the 
touring did.  It also boasts an ample 
trunk. I have owned BMW's for over 
15 years and I am more than 
pleased with the g-35's rear wheel 
platform, handling characteristics 
and most impressed with its power.  
It blows the doors off all the entry

Had 113,000 when purchased and now 138,000 1 1/2 years later. Only maintenance performed are oil changes/brakes,rotors,tires. Most needed replacing when purchased for 8,300 and valued around 10,500 at the time. The acceleration is much stronger than my mothers '03 Acura TL. Also the RWD makes for better handling in dry conditions, and in rain is not bad compared to the Acura. Don't bother taking out in snow. The clutch is original and still feels sporty as if it were new. However, when it rains the moisture causes the clutch to make unpleasant squeeks."

infiniti,g35,2003,Jay, 10/13/2018,"Fun car, just don't daily drive it",3,"I bought my 2003 G35 Coupe from the original owner with around 65k miles on it at the time of purchase. I owned the car from 2009 to 2012 and put around 70k miles on it being that it was my daily driver. This car is incredible fun; it's very fast, has one of the best stock exhaust notes of any car at its price, has a huge sunroof, and just looks great. At least the powertrain (engine, transmission) was very reliable; I never had any breakdowns or costly engine or transmission repairs the entire time I owned it. However that's where my praise ends for this car. This car is only meant to be driven in dry or wet condition, NEVER snow or ice. This car is very dangerous to drive in any amount of snow; I nearly wrecked mine several times in very mild snow, and mind you I am experienced in driving in snow and have never had nearly this much trouble driving in the white stuff in any car I've ever driven, even other RWD cars. I threw some snow tires on it at one point and it barely improved its reliability in the snow. But enough about snow driving. This car's biggest flaw is its electrical system. Less than 2-months after buying the car the trunk stopped opening with the switch up front and the geniuses at Nissan did not put any way to open it from the outside the car. I essentially had to fold the rear seats down and pull the emergency latch if I ever wanted to use it, which I rarely did given how much of a pain that is. The entire center control panel which included the radio and climate controls started acting like it was possessed around 100k miles; it would randomly shut off and then come back on, and occasionally blast AC and the only way to stop it was to shut the car off and hope it didn't happen again when you restarted it. The CD player also ate one of my CDs before it stopped working. All the interior lights eventually stopped working all at once too, including the gauge lights which made this car impossible to drive at night. It would have cost me around $2000 to get the electrical issues fixed, at which point I knew it was time to let the G35 go. Overall, I'd only recommend low milage examples of this specific year and model, and also people who only plan on taking it out occasionally or heavily modifying them. Definitely would not recommend this car to anyone who plans on using it daily, especially if you may have to drive it in snow.

While I will grant the point that the vehicle is very fast, its handling, fuel economy, build quality, and reliability are far worse than I experienced with either Audi or BMW.  Maybe I got a lemon, but the list of problems with this car is ridiculous.  On top of that, the brakes wear out every 15k miles and aren't cheap to replace.

infiniti,g35,2003,Ivan_99, 04/16/2002,Best choice,5,"This car combines many elements and 
executes them all perfectly.  The 
interior is very large, roomy and very 
quiet.  Conversations could be had at 
highway speeds without talking 
louder.  The G35 has excellent 
acceleration, especially for an 
automatic which shifts very smoothly.  
The braking complements the 
acceleration, which is better than 
most cars in the world (70-0).  All 
this is accomplished with keeping the 
vehicle weight lower than the most of 
the competition. The build quality and 
materials is excellent.  The car is 
backed up with a good warranty with 
the reliability and service of 
Infiniti."

looks great but there are some things 
one should consider before buying. 
First, let me say I have not driven the 
car, went to the dealership to check it 
out and that's where it ended. The 
dashboard is just not nice, it's small 
and not revealing a pricey car. The 
front seats are nice, and that's all.
The back seats are a disaster waiting 
to happen. I'm 5.11 feet tall and I 
could not use the back seat without 
hitting the rear window ! I wouldn't 
put anyone on the back seat from fear 
of getting them hurt on any little bump 
on the road."

a single male perspective, is this car 
attracts other guys like none other. 
People have been coming up to me and 
wanting to look inside and ask all

the country to CA.  Along the way I 
met a couple of cars that wanted to 
race.  A late model 911 Carrera that 
after 20 miles along I-70 approach 
Vail couldn't lose this car. Saw a BMW 
330i in Utah.  I have the cruise 
control on at 90 mph on a long stretch 
of highway miles from anywhere.  This 
330i wants to go so I let him pass at 
about around 100-105 mph before I get

for good measure I run it to 140(and 
it wanted more) just to add insult to

To me the only things the G35 has over the BMW are the engine, the NAV system, and maintenance cost.  This car is a rocket, but the road handling and ride quality are far inferior to BMW. The interior of the G35 is not luxury quality to me.  I will probably sell this car within a year and look into getting an M3 or porsche 911."

Then I got back in my Lexus and passed on the deal.  The designers have clearly studied Audi and Lexus, especially Audi.  There are so many Audi-isms in this car that I lost count, but suffice it to say that Infiniti did a fine job engineering this car's interior, especially the clever use of space!  Its the immaturity of the interior, the lack of refinement and the less than substantial feel and touch of the materials that got me to stay with my GS300.  

I still think the G35 is the best Infiniti theyve ever built, -the best designed, and the most fun, but not for me."

This car is so fun to drive and it looks amazing. Yes, the fuel economy is horrible and yes the brakes do go out too soon and yes the idea of controlling the radio and the air conditioner with the same part is not wise (have had experiences with it all), but still, to be an owner of this car, to look at it and drive it is out of this world.

 The feel from the driver's seat is unbelievable and very comfortable.  
Handling and performance can't be beat at the price.    The 260 Horsepower 
3.5L V6 ""eats"" the road with smooth, effortless acceleration.   I enjoy that 
the car doesn't ""lurch"" forward when slightly touching the accelerator from a 
standing start (like many cars with a larger engine).   The closest competitor 
was the BMW 3 series (330i).   While driving experience was close to the 
BMW it could not compete on price (the G35 MSRP was lower than the

true performance sedan.  I like the 
interior- business like and clean and 
more than enough luxury.  I think that 
sometimes auto critics look at the 
amount of wood and rate by that (but 
cars have progressed, and what does 
adhesive backed wood have to do with 
luxury anyway?)  the engine can humm 
along at 2500 rpms, and then jump to

Over the last 8 months, wiper motor, window motor and ac fan went with likely more to come. Otherwise regular 30k service from a good independent was fine. I allowed him to put in standard brakes rather than Infiniti  for a good savings w/o substantial loss of braking performance. Winter driving with RWD was a problem solved with Blizzak snows.  The high level of performance and reliable driving pleasure that this car gave me at a reasonable cost should not be lost. It was a blast to drive to work or explore the backroads.

they often had one or two superior

workmanship is high and I have yet to 
find any ""faults"". The interior is not

acceleration and the ability to take

It is too close to the Altima in looks. 
Infiniti simply cannot get the luxury

looks like a different trim of the 
Altima and anyone who says otherwise is 
simply being fooled by the better

believe how many people I have caught 
just staring at this car when it is 
driving down the road as well as when 
it is parked. This car is great in the 
twisted canyon roads that I frequently 
travel on. It is also very easy to 
allow yourself to cruise well above 
the posted speed limits if you are not 
careful, ( i.e. an open hwy with no 
traffic , 140mph , very stable and 
surprisingly quiet ) The Infiniti G35 
is an excellent balance of 
performance, beautiful design and more 
importantly the cost for what you are 
getting overall."
infiniti,g35,2003,carforme, 05/10/2002,parking brake pedal ??? - I'll pass,4,"Excellent performance and brakes, very 
good handling. A couple of annoying 
interior details which prevented me 
from buying it. First and ugliest is 
the parking brake pedal. Who puts those 
things in a sport sedan? In the car's 
cockpit like cabin the pedal really 
sticks out and can hit you leg when you 
move it. or during an even minor 
accident (so much for eight airbags). 
The second is the placement for 
driver's seat controls. They are right 
next to the cup holders, I think its 
similar to putting your coffee mug on 
your keyboard. The car's trunk is big 
but badly shaped, I don't think you can 
fit more then two mid size suitcases 
there. Those bugs aside it's an 
excellent car."

Bought it with 55K miles already on it, now at 119K no major issues to report. Only issue is my car has some electrical issues that come and go, radio cuts in & out, power seat sticks. This is a great highway car in the way of maneuvering and great pickup. Not so great on the MPG (one of the reasons I'm trading it in now). Had mostly owned GM vehicles but had to trade my XL Denali (my baby) in for the G35 when the gas hike hit. Have to say I liked my Denali better, just personal preference. Costly to own & on repair, thank god for the mechanic in the family (saved me a lot on labor and routine maintenance costs)."

The gas mileage is about the same as a full-size pickup. We own two other Infinitis and no problems like this one.  Good thing the car has a good resale value.  I am buying a truck.  The gas mileage is about the same and doesn't require premium fuel.  "

A little short on tire and brake lives, but more than makes up for it on the pavement.  Very roomy interior and trunk.  Outstanding acceleration and handling.

more sporty and luxurious as well. Plus 
you get more standard options then on

Our previous car was a toyota solara which cost more but wasn't half as fun to drive. Only beefs are the emergency brake interfering with left shin and window controllers are a lil low. Transmission can be slow at times but engine is definitely not. Fun to drive with VDC turned off."

It has all the services done for the mileage on the car, Fully loaded nav (with 2008 updated disk $190), sunroof, reclining back seats, cd changer.  I love how this thing drives after having a 155000 miles on it.  It is still aggressive, when you step on it it moves.  I have taken this car up to 125mph on a track with out a problem.  All the feature works great without any problem.  Even at 155000 miles, retail on this car is $11000.  Over all I couldn't have asked for more, for the price I paid, it is a steal.     "
infiniti,g35,2003,kfh, 05/23/2002,Top Choice,4,"A great car. Fun to drive and looks 
great in red. Rear reclining seats add 
comfort for back seat passengers. Most 
options should be standard on an 
INFINITI. The premium package should be 
standard. The side mirrors should be 
included in the memory function with 
the seats and standard equipment. The 
only options should be the wood 
package, sport package, heated seats, 
sun roof, cloth seats, and maybe the 
aero package. An INFINITI deserves 
everything else as standard equipment. 
My 1992 Diamante has more standard 
items than the G35. When you look at an 
Acura TL you know what equipment it 
has, almost everything is standard."

I used a Slick 50 type lube at my first oil change, and within a 2000 miles was getting 18/22.  I will try synthetic oil next, and see how that goes.  Worth buying in case you are on the fence."

I have been disappointed however with the winter performance (RWD model). It has a tendancy to slide around a lot, using all weather tires that cost about 900 dollars a set. Winter tires may help, but they seem hard to find here.  The mileage has been satisfactory but nothing spectacular (maybe 16/22). I drive about 75 freeway and get up to speed rather quickly on city.  I have had an issue with the cd player failing.  The interior likes great, but has creaks and the door paint is rubbing on the silver areas, so build quality is so-so.

getting like 19 mpg on highway.  Second 
the interior parts were not fitted well 
as there is rattling noise coming from 
the doors and backseat when I turn the 
stereo on even moderate levels.  Third, 
the integrated six CD changer is 
totally retarded-- it is slow... and it 
doesn't look like it'll be easy to swap

got 260, and 260lb of torque. No car in 
this catagory can beat that. Eventhough 
TL typeR got 260HP, it has less torque. 
Styling? I thik BMW gotta go, its style 
is the same years after years. A4 is 
not bad, but when we speak about money, 
there's a huge difference. German cars 
are over priced. With 30k, u can only 
get an Audi A4 1.8T, not even the V6 
version. As for BMW, you can only get a 
plain 325i without leather. Don't even 
think about 330i, it'll cost at least 
35k. TL is front wheel drive, and 
doesn't qualify as a true sports sedan."

I love the car its great compared to the Chrysler i used to drive. I will never go Domestic again. This car is i believe an Icon for great performance no doubt about it. However its the little things which bring me down such as the very famous electrical problem with the center console that no longer works for me and will cost over $1000 since parts alone are $900 and the recall doesn't apply to my VIN number. Other electrical such as the clock light, and wiper blade motor. These are problems I just didn't expect from Infiniti. Any car you buy will have its Flaw, electrical seems to be the G's problem. "

I drive the car as aggressively as I want, same gas mileage around 19-20 mpg mixed, or 23-25 on FWY.

I use regular fuel (personal choice) & get 22 mpg around town - even more on highway. The required maintenance, or lack of, is fantastic, also. Changing oil is the most frequent maintenance item.  One brake change in 133,000 miles.  I had rims replaced because brake dust stuck to factory rims. Now it is no problem.  Had to have some modules replaced 4 years after purchase.  The Michelin tires I purchased have lasted over 80k miles.  Still get frequent compliments on styling.  I plan to keep it for many years."

However, over the life of my ownership, I have had to replace the wiper motor, rear axle bearings, radio/climate control electronics and driver seat slide mechanism. It also, as others have noted, has a weak design of the front wheel struts which continually creak when making hard turns. This is especially noticeable during cold winters. I have averaged 28 miles on the highway which is 90% of my yearly miles so it is respectable. All in all I'm sold on Infiniti and have just purchased an 08 M35 as a replacement."

My first impression of the car was that it was going to be way out of my budget but after I looked around I found a great one for $14,000. The test drive was sealed the deal. I wanted to see how it would handle turns at high speeds so going around a corner I didn't break. It felt like poetry in car form. After the honeymoon phase of owning the car ended, I was delightfully pleased with how well the car handled in snowy conditions.

The negatives:  1) the tape deck never worked, and now the entire sound system sometimes goes off and the controls become unresponsive.  2) I used to go through the brakes like butter, and replacement was an expensive proposition, with new pads and rotors every ~15k miles even with a lot of highway driving.  Infiniti finally addressed this problem and brakes last much longer - and still stop the car.  3) Replacement parts are expensive, maybe because infiniti cars share parts in order to reduce manufacturing costs.  This results in incredibly expensive repairs - for instance, my elevated, central brake light just went out, and the cost of replacement was $500!  For a brake light!  It turns out that the part itself costs about $250.

The positives, which outweigh the negatives by a lot:  1)  the car rides and handles as if it were new.  People are surprised that the car is over 11 years old.  I'M surprised that the car is over 11 years old.  2) Infiniti replacement parts are well-made.  I only had to replace the muffler assemblies once.  3)  The car is very reliable.  It has never been out of service for any length of time for mechanical reasons.  4)  Great acceleration - terrific for merging!

I've been through 5 sets of tires and 3 sets of brakes, and one battery. Car has been dependable and trouble free since new. I just solved one of my biggest complaints 'gas milage'.
Through performance tweaking I have increased my overall mpg from 19.2 to 21.27. Prior to modifications best highway mpg was 22.3. I recently completed a 2600 mile trip and top mpg was 25.5 and overall average for the trip was 24.31. The side benefit of the modifications has been more responsive acceleration. "
infiniti,g35,2004,Austin Guerin, 12/16/2015,"Even at 6' 2""",4,"I have owned this car for over a year out. My G35 coupe has an intake system, exhaust, and racing chip and it roars. The acceleration is absolutely phenomenal. It takes curbs decently well but people look at it all the time, back in its day it was in a show. The performance is just outstanding and the noise is perfectly divided between the engine and exhaust. I am also 6' 2"" and my seat is always all the way back but I am always very comfortable. The bucket seats snug you in nicely and the steering wheel has all the right padding you need. 

Now to the bad. The brakes are a joke, you have to get aftermarket brakes with this, unless you have the brembos. The stock brakes are an absolute shame for such a vehicle, they are not that great. They are too weak. Thank the lord I have a good mechanic because I would be a lot more broke if not due to the mechanical issues. Probably because its getting old but its getting expensive. The transmission bumps a lot when its cold out before it warms up and there is a click when I shift between park reverse ect. That is concerning. 

Overall I would definitely buy this car again!

Overall great cars. I'm constantly finding excuses to drive it because it's so fun. I prefer the couple over the sedan - the sedan is more roomy and a bit more comfortable, but the coupe is more sexy, sporty, and youthful looking. 

Styling wise, it's hard for the average person to tell it's 7-8 years old. Looks modern and sporty.

Biggest difference performance-wise between the two models is the coupe is lower to the ground, and there seems to be less body roll when turning aggressively. When you sit in the couple it feels more like a race car. Not any faster than the sedan, though."

For the first 100k I put very little money into it. Just oil changes, breaks, and tires. Then at 106k the transmission went. Figures 100k drive train warranty mine went at 106k. Dealership was great and found me a used Tranny for $3100 all in. That was a major expense but considering I hadn't had a car payment for 5 years I went for it. Other than that I've had replace a rusted out exhaust. The front end suspension especially tie rods seem to crack more than expected. (note I drive on pot holed roads quite a bit). I just replaced the rear suspension at 240k miles. I still have the same cad converter but did replaces muffler and pipes over 200k. I replaced belts, fluids, spark plugs but never any major engine issues. I have the sedan at 260hp and it's still a beast with pick up. The only other major expense was replacing the bearings at around 140k miles but after that it was like driving a new car. The leather has held up well with 4 kids. I have almost no rust just a touch under the back right wheel. I have over 265k miles and still feel safe driving this car. My negatives are no Bluetooth since it's an early model. The electronics are slowly failing my left passenger window safety relay is bad. Means when I auto roll up the window and it thinks something is stuck and rolls down halfway. I can inch it closed though by not using the auto feature. The break light in the back window is actually a waste. You don't really need it and it cost's over $500 if it fails. I have Bose speakers that still sound great but the CD player seems to have sound cut in and out (I know other G35 owners with the same problem) but the radio is perfect. This would be a great first car. The things that suck are the break dust on the front wheels and there is a plastic splash guard protecting the under carriage that gets mutilated over speed bumps or gets hooked on parking pylons. I really want to buy a Q50 but my G35 is still a great free ride. I actually keep hoping something major goes wrong so I can buy the Q50 but it keeps rolling safely.

It's terrible in the snow, unless you have snow tires and really know how to drive. I've had it for 5 or 6 years and a little over 70k, it's never left me stranded. Anything that goes wrong with it you can usually fix yourself if you're mechanically inclined. It's an enthusiasts car, so if you want the feeling of a race car in your daily driver, this is it. I don't see any way I'd sell it. If the engine ever finally goes, I'll probly just put a new one in it.

When I got back I bought the car!  I have had it for 4 years and still love the car.  It is very quick and responsive.  I find it very, very comfortable (as do my passengers).

I had one service problem with the Driver's seat being stuck in a lowered position when I was vacuuming, but they promptly took care of that.

infiniti,g35,2004,jbmagic, 12/27/2006,The Problems,4,"I want to first say that this is a great car that's very comfortable for the driver and quick as well.  The problems are the front tires seem to wear on the insides.  I'm going on my fourth set of tires in the front with 34,000 miles.  Since the rear wheels and tires are larger than the fronts you can't rotate at all. The tires make excessive road noise when they wear in this manner.  My second complaint is gas mileage.  I average 15 miles per gallon and have for three years with this car. I'm an adult and while I drive sort of fast I'm far from a speed demon. Lastly is the turning radius.  It's very large and almost impossible to turn around in on a side street.  Other than that a great car"
infiniti,g35,2004,Genette T, 02/25/2018,Last review. It's gone.,3,"this is my last review of the 2004 Infiniti G35 sport sedan that I owned period unfortunately a deer jumped out of the woods onto a major highway and destroyed the car.

So I no longer get to experience the thrill of sudden acceleration and immense power.  However, I also know longer get to experience the huge maintenance cost that you don't expect to have when owning a Japanese car.

See the expenses I had while owning that car.  I'd put less than 50,000 miles on it and this amount of expenses is more than I paid for the car.  

In the two years I've had it, but particularly, since the beginning of 2019, I've spent a total of  $4478.78.  That includes new rotors and pads @$800; two sets of headlight bulbs @ $350; new battery and starter when the car died on me out of state @$449; Oil cooler O-ring- What?? @$150; Valve cover gasket $ 781.99; passenger side control arm @427.51.  Plus a whole bunch of smaller items.  I only paid $3,500 for the car. 

Before you say that is normal, I say, ""no it is not"".  I owned Lexus, Toyota and Honda.  None of them generated these this type of expenses in such a 'short period of time'.   My Accord went to 307194 miles for 10 years, before getting close to Infiniti's expense.   My compatible ES300 went 12 years, achieving 249710 miles.  Had no similar repairs before 150,000 miles on it and they were spread out.  My Camry made it to 292504 miles, never had any real issues other than normal repairs.    I love that G35 to drive, but it is was draining me.  So, in retrospect, I'm kind of glad that it is gone.

Similar to BMWs, the steering wheel, arm rest, shifter, controls and pedals are all positioned perfectly making you feel like you're in complete control of the car. Handling is excellent and steering is tight and stable. In addition, the G35x has lots of power under the hood, despite the added weight of AWD. The car accelerates quickly and responds well in the in the 3000-5000 RPM range. Very torquey, but in a good way. If you like to speed a bit, this car owns the highway like it's on greased rails. If you're a conservative driver, the overall stability of the car should give you nice piece of mind."

A ""Regional Manager"" rode with me once and said he couldn't fix all of the rattles so get used to them. The rattles and squeaks were bad enough to make me get rid of the car for a loss.

knew of this problem way back... and 
supposedly made changes to their 2004 
Nissan Maxima... however, Infiniti

35 with the same theft friendly 
lights. We were not advised of this

Nissan/Infiniti has known about this 
problem yet continues to profit from 
the sale of expensive replacement

The Infiniti got horrible gas mileage (13mpg) and within one week of purchase it needed new front brake rotors.  Car has too much torque and can't get out of its own way.

In terms of the styling this car is the watermark - they messed up the lines of car with the styling revision of the grill and lights in '05 and the current model just doesn't inspire the  head turning that this one had. Reliability - excellent. The only out of pocket expenses was for brakes. Handling is real tight and this car is plenty fast. The additional hp of the later year models doesn't help the mpgs. If they make this model again - with the brake dust issue addressed and the inclusion of larger seats found in the current model... please sign me up for a new one!

They have refused to address this problem even though warranty is still in effect. Oil light never comes on. The rack and pinion steering has had a leak and is having to be replaced."

I personally would like it to be a bit less resistant to body  roll but it's much sportier than most of what's available.  Brakes are pretty strong as well.  The 3.5L V6 has plenty of power, and has a nice sound to boot.  There are some nice touches throughout the car: the adjustable instrument panel, the reclining rear seats, dual-zone climate control, etc.  The backseat is much larger than it looks.

I love the increased power of this car, and handling is very good. The AWD does well in Midwest winters.  I have, however, had the front brakes replaced three times (only at 53,000 miles now), and the 6-disc CD changer completely died around 30,000 miles (replaced under warranty, thank goodness, as it would have cost over $650).  I also REALLY wish Infiniti would offer the AWD version with the manual transmission that is available in the RWD version of this car.

The leather interior and Bose sound system are sufficiently luxurious.  The vehicle also gets a respectable 28 mpg highway in Western PA where no roads are flat or straight. The unique styling of the Infiniti is a head turner.  I'm constantly getting compliments on the vehicle."

This is a hidden expense.  You will need to replace the brakes and rotors every year at $1,000 a pop.  Make sure you think about this before buying. I also had to replace my alternator after two years, although I didn't pay for it because it was under warranty.  I'd suggest getting a BMW if you want a stylish, performance car that is more reliable."

The transmission jerks into 2nd gear a lot, and definitely wouldn't recommend using the autoshifter because you will tear up your transmission very quickly, and it's pricey to replace. The car has a cheap feel to all the plastic pieces of the interior. Overall it drives smooth but is ridiculously bumpy on the slightest cracks in pavement.

I love the styling and performance of the car, very pleased with it.  Purchased used with 37k miles and it has not disappointed.  Negatives would be the a/c and heat controls are confusing, front seat could be a bit more comfortable.  This is not a soft luxury ride, my sport suspension package is very much a drivers car.

I purchased with 40,000 and now have 130,000 miles and have had brakes done 4 times now.  I will consider a newer g but I hope the brake issue has been solved.

When I visited the some Infiniti dealers 
I was shocked by the jackup in prices 
(Jan 03).  The Glendale Infiniti dealer 
was a welcome change from that.  Since I 
was not pressed to get the car I made a 
statement; ""If you can find a G35 coupe, 
with an exact list of extras, but NO gps 
I'll buy it for MSRP"".  At this point 
5K$ premium was usual.  In two (!) days 
I got a call that they had the car.  Was 
I suprized, the reason for the title.  
An hour or so later I was at Glendale

have brought the car in 3 times for

Pros:  This is a rock solid performer in horrible weather with the AWD.  It's fun to drive even with the automatic.  Great feel from the steering.  It has more room in back than a TSX or a 3-Series, and is adequate as our primary baby-transportation unit.   The best sport sedan under $35,000."

They stated they will replace the brakes at around 2 to 3 mil left. My only significant complaint is that my car (black) is showing many paint chips.  Supposedly this was caused by EPA reformulation of paint requirements but I haven't found those requirements, any help would be greatly appreciated on this one."

Very sleek and beautiful design. While

You would have to get the CLK500 to get 
anything near the G35's performance.

leather seats, sun roof and flipdown

infiniti,g35,2005,Joseph, 10/24/2016,"Beautiful, reliable, sports GT...",5,"I purchased this car in July of 2010 and have not regretted it for a single moment. I chose a diamond graphite coupe, 6MT revup, with black leather interior. I wanted a sports coupe that provided a sense of luxury and performance without breaking the bank.  When I purchased this car I was considering one of my long time favorites; the BMW E46 M3, along with the G37 coupe, and BMW 335i coupe. Though I knew both BMWs were better performers, I decided against them after extensive research that showed I would likely experience expensive regular maintenance and frequent, costly repairs. The G37 was also faster and had an upgraded, nicer interior, but the exterior left something to be desired for my taste. 

This car is extremely reliable, low cost maintenance, and loads of fun. I literally look forward to driving it every day. The G35 coupe is truly a beautiful car with a timeless design and I get compliments on it all the time from tuners, luxury car owners, to casual, young and old. I would argue it is one of Infiniti's best exterior designs. Concerning maintenance costs, this car has been great. I purchased it with 50k on the odometer and with it being a daily driver, it now has 166k on the odometer. My most expensive repairs have been replacing the clutch / flywheel at 150k and the power steering pump shortly after; both for under 2k... that's it! I had to replace the steering wheel clock spring and did it myself for around $50 dollars. (Used part) 

PROS... 
APPEARANCE - now this is of course completely based on ones preference, but I think this car is beautiful... and based on the feedback I get on almost a daily basis, the G35 is an aesthetically pleasing design, even by today's standards. It still holds its own next to the newest designs. It was truly innovative and groundbreaking at its debue and it still shows today with the timeless, classic lines, defining its motif. 

PERFORMANCE - fun, fun, fun... Strong, responsive engine. With 298hp it is not the fastest out there but still a competitive performer. This particular engine is shared with the 35th anniversary 350Z 300hp engine. The only difference in the intake assembly making a difference of about 2hp. With the 350Z 'Z tube' you get to the even 300hp mark.

SOUND - the exhuast note is glorious (almost exotic) and coveted by many car enthusiasts. One of the best 6 cylinder exhaust notes around, especially in this price range. Most are either too raspy, high pitched or simply unheard. I get thumbs up all the time for the G's unique, tonal qualities. Pure bliss...

RELIABILITY - The engine still runs like new and doesn't miss a beat. It does burn a little oil... about 1 quart every 3-5k between oil change intervals. 

PRACTICALITY - Great, especially considering it is a coupe. I have a 16 month old and a 3 month old and I can get them both in the back seat. (One forward facing and one rear facing child seat)  with plenty of room for myslef at 6ft. Trunk space is actually decent and the rear seats let down for larger items. Headroom is good up front, but the back not so much for taller passengers. 

CONS... 
RIDE COMFORT - don't expect a Cadillac /Benz plush ride. With the low stanced Nismo-tuned sport suspension, this car has a firm ride no doubt. I don't mind it much, but my wife and other passengers have stated it is less than desireable. It is smooth on the open highway, but does not absorb bumps and potholes well as you would expect from a 'luxury car'. It is slightly softer than the 350Z. 

NOISY Manual Transmission - On forums, the G35 and 350Z 6spd transmissions are often referred to as 'the rock crusher'. The clutch is noisy and chattery. You really notice it when sitting at drive thrus. Mine is even more noisy since I replaced the flywheel with a single mass, opposed to the oem dual mass. 

QUALITY / Materials - Interior materials are not the best but have held up
 well. An average mix of leather, plastics, and real aluminum trim that were fair and comparable for the mid 2000's. 

AUDIO / Electronics... The stereo sounds good but the interface is old and dated. I have since replaced it with a modern double-din touch screen that resolves this and many other technology related desires. 

TIRE WEAR - in its stock configuration, this car's camber setup eats up tires (inner wear) and does not have the adjustability needed to align for long wear. However, I purchased SPC's front and rear camber kit and can get a flat alignment that wears even for 40k. 

Anyway, I could get a lot more granular with this review but all things considered, I absolutely love this car. The pros outweigh the bad by multitudes. It has been a great car and I plan on keeping it for years to come. I am a detail enthusiast and take immaculate care of all vehicles I own, so I expect it to continue running and looking great. I would definitely recommend it to someone who is looking for a classy, reliable,  grand tourer...

I always loved the smooth, feminine lines of the '03-06 Gs. The interior was a bit squeaky and I never really liked the orange gauge lights,but I never had any mechanical issues until recently, when the car was nearly 9 years old.
Then the power seat switch failed ($1,700) and the power adjustment for the steering column failed too.
Personally, when electrical issues start cropping up, I ditch the car. The car was great for what it was - a sport sedan.
Rear seat room was a little tight, but I feel I got my money's worth for the car, my favorite so far. We have had five Infinitis and two Nissans through the years.

infiniti,g35,2005,Nissan Guy, 01/16/2017,My 2005 Infiniti G35X Sedan (Great Luxury Car),5,"Update: February 2020 

141,000 miles

General Maintenance on car. Besides brakes and tires had to replace some suspension parts.

Radiator will need to be replaced. Dealer I bought from had replaced with a new one (checked CarFax but I found out it was cheap) because it’s malfunctioning.

Fuel gauge isn’t consistent (will
Need to clean) 

Fuse blew so have to replace (fuse box by battery) so parking lights (reverse) work.

HID ballast for headlight has gone out. Will need to replace. 

I’ve read these are common issues as it gets older. FYI, I wil DIY the HID Lights  because it requires taking off bumper to get to headlights to disconnect ballast and replace.

Yes, the way Nissan engineered this car it’s the only way. One of the mechanics I go to said it would be over $1000 due to labor. No thanks. I YouTube it and it’s doable.

Still a great car. It’s super reliable.  As it gets older things will need to be replaced. 

Previous Review: 

I bought a 2005 Infiniti G35X (All Wheel Drive) sedan with 94,000+ miles on it on the beginning of August 2016. This car is my daily driver.  It was in great condition and I really love the way this car drives. Especially, the roar of the muffler.  I had this vehicle toward the end of summer and now through the fall and winter. It handles well on dry and wet roads. I love the stiff suspension and the the heated seats, mirrors, power everything and cool features like the ability to (by factory remote) lower all four windows down at the same time as your walking towards your vehicle. This model came without the navigation system which was okay with me. 

So, I read a lot about these cars on various forums specific to the G35. Let me start off by saying my gas mileage was horrible initially. I was averaging about 14 mpg in the city and highway. So, I reset the trip computer by simply disconnecting the battery for over an hour which rest the computer. Afterward, I drove moderately around the city and on the highway. In other words, I didn't punch it at every single stop,etc... My mileage improved to over 20 mpg in the city and highway. The system adjusts itself to the driver. So, if you really push this car all the time you will get poor gas mileage. If you test it's ability on occasion you'll get good gas mileage. BTW, I suggest sticking with the premium gas. It's just better for performance.  

Oil consumption happens with the engines as you get around 100k. It will burn about a quart of oil every 1,500-2000 miles. It's normal. Nothing to be alarmed about. I'm using conventional oil but will probably change to high mileage. Others use synthetic oil but I had a lot of leak issues with a Maxima when I turned to it. If your car hasn't been using synthetic I would suggest not using it when it has higher mileage. 

The brake issues heard about with these cars can be remedied by buying after market brakes and pads instead of the defective Nissan.  

Overall, the car gives you the luxury and ride of a BMW and Mercedes at a fraction of the repair cost. After all, you're riding in a Nissan. A Nissan that was engineered to compete with those European cars. For a car thats 12 years old it's still gets looks. 

Now, it doesn't have usb ports so you'll have to add. I had to use a plug in phone holder through the cigarette lighter because there really isn't a good place to put your phone. And i have my usb port through it. 

Oh, and every instrument light in the car is amber color. Basically a light orange.  Some people hate it. Others like it or their indifferent to it. Personally, I think it's okay.I like the car too much to worry about something that trivial.  Nissan didn't make it all red because they didn't want to copy BMW and Mercedes. 

If you want a solid sedan with 280 horse power that won't be super expensive to fix, this is the vehicle for you. Keep in mind, with any used car you buy it's
 important to get one in good condition. This car can last for over 200,000 miles and I plan to keep mine for another 100,000+ miles.

With the exception of the BMW, none handled or responded like the G35. The BMW handled superbly, but was priced thousands more after similar options.  In addition, Infiniti has made several improvements in the 05 G35. The steering wheel controls now illuminate, the wheel and telescope are now power with memory seat, hp was upped to 280. The interior was also improved in-terms of visual appeal and overall quality.  This car is an excellent blend of both luxury and performance.

It isnt overly common like the BMW 3 series, but it handles just as great. It is very pretty to look, and then again it isn't in the shop every other week like my old A4. My one gripe with this car would have to be the fuel economy, if your lucky you'll avg about 20mpg for a tank, compared to the 30 of the A4. But then again somthing needs to fuel that monster. You step on the pedal and your flying, before i bought this car i drove the IS250,325CI,A4, and C230. The G blows all of them away. It gives you much more power(that is much more reliable) then all of its competitors and for a lower price."
infiniti,g35,2005,eiji81, 05/14/2015,"Great Looks, Fun to drive, Nice car for its age",4,"I bought my 05 G35 Coupe 6spd in Oct 2014 with 116k miles. Before buying this car I looked at a 05 BMW 3series, Honda S2000, and Nissan 350z.  For the price range, the G35 has the best value and features. It has usable back seats, 19"" rims, all power options, and Navigation. Overall its a nice luxury sports car, but at this age and mileage but at this age is expected to have some issues and be a little outdated. I repaired a few things: front brakes, 6cd changer/nav, front control arms, clutch master cyclinder, and drive belts. Maintenance costs can be expensive if you don't have warranty. It can get 19-22mpg city and around 25mpg hwy.  
Update Nov 2019: (Pedal issue is a design defect from the manufacturer. Replaced it with RJM pedal kit $300 and solved the issue).  During hot weather e.g. summer, the factory clutch pedal will only return half-way up after being released when you're driving in traffic. So you'll have to pop the clutch pedal back to its original position with your left foot. From my research, this is a fault of the design of the clutch pedal and also the clutch fluid line location.  I try not to drive my car when its very hot or in heavy traffic (night time driving and highway is fine though).  During the winter when outside temp is 75F or below, the clutch pedal is not an issue.
On the plus side, the A/C system on the G35 is excellent and always keeps the inside very cool in the summer.  The heated front seats are great during winter as well.  The car looks great and the exhaust sound is very sporty.  The engine has plenty of power and torque for daily driving. Driver window motor has started intermittently not working from wear of the window motor(needs replacement).

infiniti,g35,2005,anders7, 09/19/2011,A good Q car,4,"I've had my G35 for 4 years now and I used to change cars regularly. Previous cars were BMWs and Mercedes but I got tired of the exorbitant costs involved in just keeping them going. 

This last time I looked at the little BMWs and Mercedes and thought why not try something different? So I looked at the Infiniti G35 and the Lexus GS300. There was not much of a cost difference and the Infiniti seemed like so much more car for the money. 

People complain about the mileage. I get a solid 21 mpg with 80% hwy driving. That's excellent for a heavy car with a powerful engine. Sadly it does drink premium only. "
infiniti,g35,2005,Former professional driver, 01/23/2016,"Beautiful, fast, reliable but...",4,"Bought this coupe used with only 24,000 miles on it. Loved the exterior styling and the handling (still do). It's been very reliable except the drivers side power window, but I only put about 7500 miles a year on the car.  The owners manual recommends premium gas but it will drive OK on regular. Bose sound system is fine. I don't have nav.  Climate control works great. Front seats are OK, but my wife complains about them and about getting out of the low seat. Not much knee room in back. Interior materials were never luxurious but still look nice. Trunk is a little small but the back seat folds down for extra cargo space. The car sits low, which looks good and maybe aids handling and aerodynamics, but can be a problem with parking blocks, large potholes and other roadway hazards where underside clearance could be an issue.

Pros: Outstanding handling and plenty of power. Very stable and fun to drive on the highway, if it is not icy or snowy. Drives well in town too, if not icy or snowy.  Exhaust has nice but not intrusive tone. Solid, gorgeous, sporty car.

Cons: Road noise is high at all speeds above 20 mph. New, quiet-tread tires help some, but still noisy by modern standards; gas mileage not great even using premium, would be better if the automatic had another gear or two; terrible traction in snow with just all-season tires; have replaced drivers side window motor twice.

But for the road noise and the lack of traction in snow, I would drive this car anywhere the roads are paved and good, across the country or across town.

A lot of tiny things brings this car down. Be sure to visit a dealership if your car burns a lot of oil! Infiniti will perform a oil change & document your levels & have you return after 1,000 miles to see if you need a new engine.

The tires don't last, the interior wears quickly (not that it looked that spectacular in the first place), the radio is less than user friendly, the paint is inferior and the road noise is simply unacceptable in a car that costs this much.
Actually the road noise is worse than in my son's Toyota pick up truck or my wife convertible.
And the turning radius is inferior to those vehicles as well, despite what edmunds or any other website might tell you.
Not a fan of the traction/stability control - almost got me hit a few times by hitting the brakes and killing the accelerator.

The vehicle has gone through several oil consumption test, the valve covers have been replaced twice, the exhaust pipes are covered in black desposit and inifiniti won't acknowledge it as a lemon. This is not the kind of treatment that one would expect from a ""luxury"" dealership. Do your homework and research this car very carefully, if you do a quick web search you will find out I'm not this only one with this kind of problem."

I looked at Acura TL, Audi A4, Cadillac CTS, BMW 330, and I'm glad I went this way.  Best blend of room, performance, build quality and features I've seen.  The ride is very smooth and soft over bumpy roads, yet the car handles aggressively when pushed to the task.  Minor defects addressed by the dealer thus far (headlight adjustments, speaker rattling, heated seat malfunction, bizarre engine hesitation attributed to bad gas).  The AWD is masked by the VDC/TCS; I usually disengage the VDC, but when driving in snow with VDC off, you can easily swing the back around, which questions how well the AWD really works."

Since mine was bought through an auction when it was taken in for routine maintenance there were all the service records were maintained. Not saying everyone will agree about how great a G35x is but in my opinion a fun & great car compared to alot of the higher end luxury cars.
infiniti,g35,2005,zach23, 05/06/2015,Buy this vehicle!,4,"This is truly an astonishing machine. The bond that I have shared with Infiniti has moved me to become an Infiniti salesman. First off I have owned two this model, a 2004 g35 manual and now a 2005. Opt for the 2005 if you have the option, it has a sexier hood taillights and other features, like more horsepower etc. It drives amazing. We have a lot of hills and curves in Wisconsin so I can truly say I have tested these cars. If you floor it after 3000rpm hold on tight as you are pushed into the plush leather seats. So comfortable and well built. Fuel economy is 30mpg hwy not bad for a 306 horsepower beast. You will not regret owning this vehicle I promise. Way better than is300,tl,bmw etc.   "
infiniti,g35,2005,Jay Em, 10/06/2015,Luxury Fast sports car,4,"I bought the car a month ago, I always liked this car in coupe model and for a ten year old car it out performs even the newer sports cars in the market. The powerful VQ motor will get you excited each time you turn the ignition On, overall its a fun car with a lot to offer, I like the style better than the G37 newer model, no offense, as a G35 driver I must say that this sports car will make you feel like a teenager again, turns heads especially the girls, a good value automobile.

infiniti,g35,2005,Infinitimama, 09/08/2016,If you have $8K to spend on a sporty sedan in 2016,4,"You can't go wrong with this car.  My old car died unexpectedly, so I was in a bind to get something that looked good, was inexpensive but sporty and had four doors. I found this clean six-speed manual G35 on a used car website, the price was only $8700. It had 85K miles on it, was in great shape inside and out,  had 18 inch wheels, dark tint, black on black with leather interior and the Bose radio.  I only drive manual transmission cars, so I jumped on it, and I've had it two weeks now.  It's not perfect, but I seriously love this car. The GREAT things about it are: It's quick. Acceleration is top notch! Shifting is short and smooth, passing is easy, and the engine has a low roar that will get you in a good mood. It feels solid on the road. Handling is great. The styling doesn't scream ""I'm 11 years old!"" at all. It still looks really good.  When I tell people it's a 2005, they are surprised.  Other good things to note - the inside is roomy for a sports sedan, even in the back seat. Power outlets, three cubbies for storage, in-dash 6 disc CD changer, and an armrest that comes down with cupholders for the rear passengers. I like the location of the clock and the features like cruise control, seat memory, and the dash are easy to use and locate. As far as getting a sporty sedan with the most bang for your buck, a used G35 is the way to go. Now - the bad stuff is the same as other reviewers. The inside is a bit noisy - little clicks, clanks and creaks as you are driving. They are slight but you will notice them after a while and wish they would go away. I also don't know why the Bose audio is supposed to be spectacular because it's nothing special. Not much bass unless you really crank it. I'm already thinking about upgrading the head unit and speakers, because I had better factory audio in my old Mustang. The inside materials and design are also basic and nothing special. Also the turning radius seems a bit wide.  Overall though, unless you are really nitpicky about the negatives, I would recommend this car in a heartbeat.

UPDATE...Edmunds asked me to update my review. I've had the car six months and I still love it.  I just might be an Infiniti fan for life.

The Infiniti is now my wife's primary car, but she still let's me drive it from time to time.  I like a sporty handling car, and this is it, firm but not harsh.  People think I have a new car and don't believe it is 12 years old with 152,000 miles on it.  I'd like to replace it, but I'm having trouble prying my wife's hands off the steering wheel.
Finally in the Spring of 2018, when the car was 13 years old with 155,000 miles on the odometer, I traded the Infiniti for a Subaru Legacy, partly because the nearest Infiniti dealer here in Maine is 45 miles away.

Unreal power, good brakes, stiff chassis for instant steering response, and decent cornering.  The price for this is a stiff, but well-controlled ride. Fuel mileage is 19-21 around town, 24-26 highway. I actually like the 2005-2006 interior, instruments & controls better than the 2007-up G35.  A minor annoyance is a very ""creaky"" center console, which is worse on cold days.  Had the engine die on me 3 times with an error code displayed, although it would restart in a minute or less. The dealer ended up replacing a cam position sensor for free, even though the 4-yr warranty had expired. "
infiniti,g35,2005,Recent College Grad, 05/02/2006,Just Purchased,4,"Having just purchased a pre-owned G35x, I can only offer my initial thoughts. The exterior design, particularly with chrome wheels and tinted windows, is upscale without being too flashy. I can't get enough of the acceleration and handling which blow the doors off my previous car, an Audi A4. I echo the general comments about poor fuel economy and somewhat sub-standard interior plastics which contrast the quality-feeling upholstery.  For bang for the buck, however, you cant top the G35, especially if you wait a year and save 10 grand on a pre-owned.  "
infiniti,g35,2005,Jim, 03/27/2008,Happy with my 6MT,4,"I haven't experienced the brake or abnormal tire wear problems that many others have, although I concur that the OEM tires -- which I replaced with pricey but far superior Michelin Pilot Sport PS2s -- left a lot to be desired.  I usually average 21.8 mpg in mostly highway driving. We've all felt the pain of higher gas prices recently, and for the past couple weeks I've been driving with a very light foot (very atypical for me) to see how much the mileage would improve. I was absolutely astonished to get an honest 28 mpg on a recent 110 mile highway trip where I limited my max speed to 60 mph. I cruised at around 70 on the return trip and the overall mileage dropped to 27.2. Not too shabby! "

which was released in late October 
2004. The interior materials and 
instrument panel display are MUCH 
nicer than the 2004 model. Dual power 
seat recliners and tilt w/ telescoping 
steering wheel are now standard 
equipment for 2005 as well. But, most 
of all, there is the newly available 
Sport Suspension Package which 
includes better handling and nice 
looking 19"" wheels--you will not be 
disappointed with this package! 
Combine the Sport Pkg with the Premium 
Pkg and you have the perfect blend of 
sport and luxury in one vehicle. A 
bargain at 36-37K, especially when 
compared to high-line makes like BMW & 
Mercedes which cost thousands more for 
less vehicle."
infiniti,g35,2005,Good Riddance!, 07/01/2005,Good Riddance,3,"I've owned many new cars over my lifetime and I can honestly say this has been by far the biggest dissapointment I have ever had. There is nothing worse than making a $500 car payment on a car that you are not thrilled with. Yes the exterior is phenomenal, but I felt like I was dating a supermodel without a brain or personality. The auto tranny was terrible(the manual isn't much better), the interior highly UNrefined, and the suspension very crude, having plenty of grip, but too harsh for roads here in New England. I guess if you drive in warm climates with no potholes, or haven't been treated to having cars with some refinement, I'm sure the car will be fine for you. No hard feelings."
infiniti,g35,2005,Randy, 10/23/2018,"Decent car, not worth the money",3,"For the prices these cars are going for and the price i paid for it ($11,000) it is not worth it. For starters it suffers from several issues that are common with the model. Some of these common issues are the window motors, the interior falling apart, and burning oil. For the Manual transmission one some gears grind and in mine it was 5th gear. For as much money that these cars cost, the quality is subpar. Yes, the engine is strong but you'll encounter some issues that are ridiculous. In mine specifically, the ABS pump went bad. I know people that have cars with 2 or 3 hundred thousand miles and i have a couple friends who are mechanics and they were all amazed that the ABS pump would go bad. My car had 120,000 miles on it. Also it was having electrical issues which led me to just trade it in for a newer car.  There were many things i loved about this car, since the day i first saw it on the road as a little kid, I always wanted one and i was stoked when i finally was able to buy one. The car is fast and the V6 is a great motor. BUT, i was very disappointed at the bad quality as a whole for the car. I dont recommend if it's going to be your main source of transportation.

All her service was done at the Acura dealership and total repairs to date are $3600.
I love driving the Infinity----I don't care for the Acura, but the repairs are just expensive to her car.
That's really my only complaint about the car.
Both extended warranties just expired last week, and both cars have around 80,000 miles.

I probably will purchase another Infinity when this car dies."

However, we are experiencing a big problem with the front, side airbags.
Just replaced the driver's side a few months ago to the tune of $1,700; now the driver's side bag has failed and Infiniti wants even more.
I believe this is a serious safety problem and extremely pricey.
Further, Inifiniti will not give any leeway to me even though this is a problem that should not be occurring in any car.
They appear to not want to stand behind safety issues.
BTW, what's worse, they turned this over to Nissan so even though you may think you're buying a premium car, they treat this as a Nissan problem.

Got tired of maintaining BMWs.  Wish I had done it two cars ago.  Infiniti has tons of power, handling is excellent, car is so solid in feel. If you have $50K for a BMW 550i and $3K a year to maintain it, ok, but the G35 is very, very damn close for 40% less money. Lows: Brakes are not quite up to what I am used to.  Bose stereo is a disappointment. The suspension is smooth, but not as composed as a BMW over rough pavement. Highs:  Power. Engine has a great sound.  The design is well thought out. Good back seat space/comfort.  Inexpensive maintenance compared to a German car."

The gas mileage is really good to me, especially for a luxury car.

I wanted the Sport-Suspension pkg and worth every penny. Premium pkg. Aero pkg. The splash guards look great. and it seems all of them come with the trunk carpet.   I do miss the 12-volt socket on the 03' that was left of the glove box on the outside. I liked the seats when you let the back seat passenger out and you put the seat back up the seat would go back to it's original place. The 05' does not do that.

Now the clutch is slipping at 14k, the dealer blames me although I treat the car like a baby. Very disappointed that a $36k needs a new clutch at 14k miles.  So the fact that the tires only last about 18k miles, I'm looking at replacing tires and clutch in less than two years.

The car does not have a gauge that tells the average miles/gal I am getting. Its pretty annoying trying to calculate it! There for some reason are little rattles in the interior cabin. When I go over bumps and play the stereo loud I hear them the most. The last thing would be the brake dust and the fuel economy. I was not expecting Honda civic gas mileage however I wasn't expecting it to be this bad. The acceleration is good but I don't feel as good as everyone makes it out to be.

I get about 18-20mpg city & 24-28 highway, which is pretty good considering I have 20"" wheels, a heavy foot & 3"" exhaust. the interior rattles a lot & no luck w/ the dealer. I have 61K fun miles on this car & plan to drive it to the ground then rebuilt the motoer w/ a turbo."

It has premium pkg C and I guess the sport package since I have a full sized spare tire and rim in the trunk. I have been very impressed by my car. This car is for the ""grown man"" that likes to play with his toys still. I'm a 23yr old male who was considering a wrx sti limited also. But after my test drives I was willing to lose some power to get way more luxury and comfort. This has to be the best blend of power/luxury in my experience."
infiniti,g35,2005,chebella82, 09/29/2008,3 years still like new,4,"Had my G35 for almost 3 years and it's still the same as when I drove it home new - absolutely no problems of any kind, but then it only has 30k miles on it. Just got new tires after 27k miles. I have every available package and option except navigation. Love the 19 inch wheels and sunroof, and tiptronic transmission is fun, but glad to change back to regular automatic mode once I get in traffic. 22-23 mpg consistently, and I drive like a bat outta hell!"
infiniti,g35,2005,Siggy, 10/14/2008,Careful buying used,4,"I purchased it used, pretty sure the previous owner didn't know how to drive a manual transmission that well considering after 2000 miles my clutch, hydrolic cylinder, and flywheel required replacement. Aside from that the car has been a dream"
infiniti,g35,2005,radardodger, 11/06/2008,Very fun ride!!!,4,"This vehicle replaced my 2005 Lexus IS 300. Most of my review is directly comparing the G35 to the Lexus,  since it's in the same class.  The G35 seems to be a class winner in my eyes. More power and interior room than the IS 300, and Audi A4,  and possibly more of both than a BMW 330i. What ever trivial gripes I have about the vehicle are forgot when I get on a back road and get to play with the 6 speed manual trans. Body roll is very minimal for its size,  steering is respectively quick, and the manual gear box is simple to use, and fun to really bang through the gears :).  Very nice howl of the 3.5 v-6, fairly quiet inside, but still louder than most of its class competitors "
infiniti,g35,2005,Dukeboy22, 11/14/2008,"50,000 miles - No major problems",4,"I purchased my G35 in June 07 with 29k miles.  Since then, I added 22k more miles, with few troubles.  First, the tires I have are great, and I just rotated them, yesterday, after 22k miles.  I don't think I will change them until they have close to 40k on them.  They are definitely NOT OEM. Second, I had a funny scrunching noise in the suspension, possibly the shocks/struts.  The dealership replaced this free of charge under warranty (though I still hear some of the same sound - revisiting dealer!).  Third, I had a dummy light come on 2 weeks ago, which the manual said was low tire pressure.  I inflated the, the light went away!  Its fast, a little bumpy, very sexy, and it makes me happy!  "
infiniti,g35,2005,Justinr321, 12/27/2008,Nice and Sporty Entry Level Luxury Car,4,"I bought this vehicle after I totaled my 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse. I wanted something very nice but not too expensive considering I was only going to finance something for about 3 years (I didn't want to keep my next car very long). I ultimately decided on a used luxury car and found this. It is a great car. It is fast, very comfortable, drives smoothly, luxurious, and actually gets ok gas mileage. I like it much better than my Eclipse. Drives amazing at 66,000 miles."
infiniti,g35,2005,Gbreeze, 01/30/2009,Love It!!!,4,"I just bought this car used with 50k miles. We have been getting a lot of snow lately and my AWD G35 handles great in snow. My driveway drifts every year and I didn't even shovel it out. I wanted to test my G35 and it got right out. The car looks awesome as well, and the 280 hp is sweet too. This is the closest thing to German engineering. The handling, performance, horsepower minus the reliability problems that German cars are known for. I wish it had better gas mileage but I know it's my fault because I have a heavy foot at times."
infiniti,g35,2005,DR, 01/17/2008,Infiniti G35x,4,This is a great car that is fun to drive.  Does great in the snow.  Great value.
infiniti,g35,2005,Cliff, 06/24/2009,Great enthusiasts car!,4,"I purchased this G35 4 DR 6M sedan privately in 2006.  I had been watching the reviews through the magazines and was really impressed with the style, quality and performance for the money.  When I drove the car in a road test, I was sold.  It had 24,000 km.  I have now driven it for over 3 years and still love every time I sit in the seat.  It now shows 82,000 km on the clock and I have not had any significant issues to deal with.  Sure the mileage isn't great, but it didn't buy it for its economy; but more for its performance and agility.  Turn off the VDC (vehicle dynamic control) and you can turn this docile elite sedan into an adrenaline rush of acceleration. I love it as do passengers."
infiniti,g35,2005,Jeannie, 07/26/2009,I LOVE this car!!!,4,"I just bought this car yesterday and I LOVE IT!  I have been looking at Infiniti's for over 2 years and am glad I stayed with them.  This car has power beyond dreams, comfort and style along with elegance and class.  I only wish tinted windows were part of the package but I will be taking it in on Monday!  I have driven a Durango for the last 6 years so the mileage isn't a huge issue and the power makes it well worth it!   "
infiniti,g35,2005,chipito, 08/21/2009,I Love This Asian Cruise Missle,4,"The bullet nose hints at the performance of this relatively cost effective AWD sports sedan. Forward midship engine placement results in a nearly perfect 50/50 weight distribution. 100% RWD with blessed over steer until slip is detected, then up to 50/50 AWD keeps the car on track even in snow and heavy downpours. The efficient FM 3.5 V6 engine has been a dream for the price point - why spend $15K+ more for a Euro badge and more maintenance costs? BMW = Burning More Wealth; Audi= An Ultra Dollar Incinerator; Get a better AWD performance investment with Infiniti"
infiniti,g35,2005,Former Porsche Owner, 09/28/2009,From Porsche 944S to G35 Coupe 6MT,4,"I have owned a Porsche 944S for 22 years. As the maintenance bills began to climb it was time to buy a new vehicle. After reading many reviews the G35 6MT seemed to be my next car. This was sealed after I test drove the vehicle. The power delivery is absolutely flat in terms of torque curve and the handling is on par with my beloved Porsche. The steering is just a tad too power assisted, but beyond that, this car is just as much fun to drive. The convenience features are well thought out and executed. The service at the dealership continues my pleasant Infiniti experience. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a sporty driving experience."
infiniti,g35,2005,Malafis, 11/16/2009,Love it,4,I bought my 2005 g35x in August of 2008. I loved this car since the day I bought it. The only thing that I don't like is the brake wear on the car. I learned that this car comes stock with a softer brake pad which results in greater braking power but also results in shorter brake life.
infiniti,g35,2005,ang35, 04/10/2010,Great car; fun to drive,4,"Wonderful car for speed or cruising. Sound system great, seats pretty good. Plenty of passenger room for 4."
infiniti,g35,2005,John, 04/19/2010,Best deal going right now,4,"After extensive research (including some on edmunds.com) I bought an '05 Garnet Fire G35 with the Premium package (keyless start, reclining rear seats, etc).  I really like this car.  Gets 20-24 MPG consistently (60/40 HWY/TWN).  Very smooth riding with the exception of going over bumps on a turn (on ramp, etc) the cars seems to 'jiggle' slightly.  I may be somewhat sensitive though since I traded in an '04 GTO that was very stable on the road. Smooth V6 that accelerates hard above 3500 RPM and has plenty of torque above 3000 RPM.  Look around and get one that is loaded out. The cost is about the same as a base one in the used market and the features are worth a little leg work."
infiniti,g35,2005,Jenna, 02/21/2008,Owned For Two Years,4,"Love this car.  Tires are expensive and services are expensive.  I have the 6MT and haven't had any problems with it.  Only to replace the battery and the driver side window motor all covered by the warranty @ 35,000 miles.  Fun to drive and enough room to bring my luggage for trips.  Beats the automatic cars any day.  Excellent engine, smooth sound.  Love the exhaust growl as well."

infiniti,g35,2005,jer, 12/17/2004,Maxima to G35,4,"Great driving car! Much better than FWD maxima,but not as much room. Reworked interior much improved for 2005,also more power. Feels as if your in a V-8. Had to give up sunroof due to headroom, and seat could be longer for better thigh support, but the way it handles makes up for having a smaller space. Anyone under 6'3"" should be OK."
infiniti,g35,2005,aero2law, 12/22/2004,Very Sweet,4,"I bought my coupe last month with all the bells and whistles.  The car's a dream to drive, and it turns heads.  As an engineer myself, I have a special appreciation for the challenges associated with successfully blending form and substance.  Infiniti's designers have achieved a wonderful balance between the car's appearance and performance.  I was originally considering the BMW330i; but a test drive of both cars, along with the G35's appearance won me over to the G35.   The slight difference in price of the two cars was not a factor in my decision."
infiniti,g35,2005,John Mozena, 01/06/2005,G35 Coupe,4,Great car with luxury features at resonable rates. The sports package drives tight and responsive. The seat belt is alittle tight across the shoulder but is the only complaint I can find. The new lakeshore blue is outstanding with the larger wheels and tires.
infiniti,g35,2005,Walter Pidgen, 01/06/2005,Great Car,4,Great Car.  It turns heads wherever you go.  At last a car I can feel comfortable with merging onto the freeways.  Fantastic power and control.

The G's performance and overall completeness are second to none within it's class and beyond! This autmobile should be considered highly!!!   "
infiniti,g35,2005,The Hooligan, 01/29/2005,Best of all worlds,4,"Overall, best buy in this class...period. Compared to Acura TL, but FWD was a turnoff. I have driven the G35X in snow, sleet, freezing rain, and dry...and nothing can stop it. The ""snow"" mode is priceless in itself! Improvements in the interior from 2004 are many, including better seats, nice gauge layout, and real aluminum trim.  The best part is actually driving though. Acceleration is superb. Braking is strong. Handles well. AWD steering is heavy though, so it takes effort. SMARTKEY: worth the price to leave keys in pocket and go! MP3 player works great with burned CDs. Price is good considering content."
infiniti,g35,2005,Joe, 01/30/2005,Best Small Sedan.....Period,4,"I'm one of those customers that car dealers love - I buy way too many cars too quickly.  I've had 10 cars in the past 12 years.  I do Extensive research before buying a car so I get a good deal and am as pleased as possible with my purchase.  But that's why I generally go back for another purchase - there's either something that could be better with my car or there's something better in a newer car.  After purchasing/driving the G35, I can say this is without a doubt The Best car I've ever owned.  Interior finishes truly luxury.  Exterior styling is sporty, but understated.  Driving experience is unmatched: Very powerful, smooth daily driver, and yet will respond to aggressive driving nicely"
infiniti,g35,2005,tom hert, 01/31/2005,noisey in Seattle,4,"Lots of fun to drive on smooth roads.  Road noise is awful, like driving a drum.  Styling is fantanstic.  Acceleration not much better than my acura legend coupe. Surprisingly good on ice."
infiniti,g35,2005,KGM, 02/02/2005,Well-rounded German slayer,4,"Anyone who is looking to spend between $30K-$40K for a sports sedan with all- wheel drive and has been focusing their attention on BWM, Mercedes or Audi products is doing themselves an injustice by not test driving the 2005 G35X.  In the first few minutes behind the wheel, you can tell that the Infiniti engineers logged plenty of hours at the helm of those German benchmarks, and learned from what they experienced.  The new G35X performs and handles like a sports car, has the look and feel of a luxury sedan, and shreds snow covered streets like a 4x4 suv.  No car in its class can do so many tasks so expertly for so little sticker shock.  Sorry 330xi and A4, but there is a new kid in town."
infiniti,g35,2005,Morrie, 02/02/2005,Practical and a Blast to Drive,4,"This is truly a driver's car, but with enough practicality to function as a family car.  Amazing performance, with the overall feel of a much more expensive car.  It's a huge step up from a Maxima or I35, which are in the same price range.  Unless you really must have front wheel drive, the G35 should be considered.  Also considered the Cadilac CTS.  A nice car, but there is less interior space, a higher price and the build quality is lower."
infiniti,g35,2005,Henry Hamilton, 02/02/2005,I love my G35,5,"In the past I have purchased three and five series BMWs and have been happy with except for the constant repairs.  This time I decided to get a Japanese car so I looked at the ES330, the TL and the Maxima. The first time I drove the G35 I was sold. It handles great and has lots more power than my bimmers did."

infiniti,g35,2005,Woody, 02/04/2005,Best Bang for the Buck,4,"Unbelievable the amount of car you get for the money.  The G35 Coupe has surpassed my expectations.  The interior is clean and well laid out and very roomy for a sport coupe seating 4.  Driver's seat is very comfortable.  The Bose stereo system is crystal clear and also works as an MP3 6 disc player to hold a ton of tunes.  The exterior design is terrific.  Sophisticated yet sporty.  The G35 has the look of a car that should cost at least 10-20K more.  Finally, step on the gas and feel the force of your body pushed back into the seat by the the 280 hp engine.  Slip in and out of traffic or around sharp turns with ease.  This car is the complete package."

This car has great looks from inside and out. Exhaust noise is fun to listen to when excelerating. Its very tempting to drive this car really fast, feels very smooth and comfortable at high speeds, feels like 50s when driving at 80. This car has a lot of room in the second row. Bose stereo perfomrs less than expected but its OK. Had the chance to drive my G 35X in snow, 4-wheel drive system was great, no slip, no skid, very manouvreable in snow. Its thousands cheeper than BMW 3 series with much more features for much less money, great buy."

I have lost nothing in straight line performance and it handles much better. It also is much more luxurious. I think it is gorgeous and the performance is excellent.  I am getting daily compliments on how it looks. It also sounds very nice, although nothing beats the old Mustang.  The price is a fair value, probably a very good value. I considered a BMW 330i, but it costs more. I also considered another Mustang, but this car is easily worth the extra $9 to $10,000 more."

Now in my 50's, and having done the four-door, luxury routine (mostly Lincolns), I decided it was my time.  I learned of the Infiniti quality (absolutely tops) owning a four-door I35, and finally decided ""what the hell"" and bought the two door G35 coupe (auto.).

The 4WD handles nimbly with terrific acceleration, with the car going exactly where you want it to go.  Steering and braking are sure and precise. It's a blast to drive!  But the sports performance does not compromise the 4 door luxury comfort.  Head and leg room are better than other cars in this class, and cargo room is much better than others.  With the Premium package, the full complement of luxury features is at your finger tips, from keyless entry and starting, to heated seats, dual thermostat, to reclining rear seats.  And, all this value for a price that can't be beat."

infiniti,g35,2005,Michael Z., 04/08/2005,The best bang for your buck!,4,"After exaustive research is finally purchased my G35x. The car is absolutely a blast to drive. I wanted a car with true sports car dynamics, comfortable ride, and some luxury appointments. I also wanted all wheel drive, and the reliability that generally comes with Japanese vehicles. For me it quickly became clear that the G35x offered a near perfect combination of all the things I was looking for in a car for a very competative price, especially when compared to its German counterparts. Compare the statistics, and then go drive one. This car sells itself."

It's as much fun to drive, the reliability is higher than the 3 series and the roominess was incredible compared to the Bimmer.  The 3 series is really a sub compact. The only disappointment was in the gas mileage, although not terrible, not as high as it could have been."
infiniti,g35,2005,Judy, 04/21/2005,Good car,4,"This car is beautiful, fast and fun to drive with all the bells and whistles. But it is lighter in weight than an Acura or a Lexus. That is the only set back.Its too light and seems not as solid a car for the money that it is priced at."

I originally went to Lexus b/c of the brand name, but was told to also check out the G35.  I'm sure glad I did!  The performance is outstanding, and the interior quality gives up nothing to Lexus.  The ride is not quite as smooth or quiet, but the higher performance and sportier look more than make up for it.  I highly recommend you check this vehicle out when shopping the entry-luxury category."
infiniti,g35,2005,Sean, 04/29/2005,5AT G35 Coupe,4,"Even with the 5AT transmission, the coupe is a very fast and fun car to drive.  The manumatic mode helps to overcome any shortcomings of having a manual, particularly in heavy traffic.  The sport tuned suspension is a well recommended option, the 19"" wheels look great and the ride is smoother with this car than on previous models with 17"" wheels.  Only downside to the car so far is the seats have side bolsters that tend to jab most people in the shoulder or back, but otherwise an extremely comfortable, well built and luxurious sports coupe that you can get for $40k or less."
infiniti,g35,2005,Scott, 05/01/2005,Black Beauty,4,"I cannot due justice to the bang for your buck with this vehicle. I have the performance package, obsidian black on chrome 18"" wheels, fin and molding kit. Willow leather interior fully loaded with nav and 225 watt Bose system. I black tinted the rear windows. Does anyone remember Night Rider? A K&N air filter gives it about 5 more horses that pushes it to 285 hp. The car growls when I hit it. I turn more heads than a Paris Hilton video. This vehicle is solid and and true performer. I am a V8 guy normally. I went from Jag super charged V8 that put out 370 hp. I was concerned about losing that huge punch that only a big V8 can deliver at any speed. I found it! No regrets. "

infiniti,g35,2005,MikeH, 05/01/2005,buyers remorse,3,"While the 2005 G35X is fun to drive in a straight line and pretty goon on flat turns, after just 4 months I am ready to take a bath on it and get a 2006 BMW 3 series.  The brake peddle squeeks, the windows rattle too much and there is a noise in the pillar that drives me nuts.  It is fun to drive, roomy and less than a BMW, but as they say you get what you pay for and it doesn't feel near as solid as a Jetta I once had.  After just 1000 miles the firm solid ride turned into a floating avg. car.  To me it's little more than an Altima with luxury features. I got XM, Premium, DVD in mine. Over all I am very disappointed with the purchase."
infiniti,g35,2005,D BIG WILD, 05/01/2005,This is a real blast,5,"OK I traded my FX35 which I owned for 6 months, liked it. I wanted something sporty and quick. Reseached the anniv.Z, Mazda RX8, BMW 3 & Crossfire.The obvious was the G355M.Great styling and it is quick, as fast as the Z with more comfort and function.No sunroof in the Z.Rx8 too slow,BMW too over priced for what you get, not to mention the service costs.Crossfire cool design and very quick,but Chrysler service is notorius for being poor and they hate to do warrenty work."

infiniti,g35,2005,Bill T, 05/12/2005,See Ya!!,5,"With out a doubt the sexiest coupe for the money.  Great off the line, it is a pleasure see everyone in your rearview mirror.  Suprisingly, the rear seats are roomy. I have 2 girls (9 & 13) and they fit just fine.  It doubles as a famly car, but its all sportcar.  It is tight on the curves.  You feel like one with the road.  The power is not wasted with spin outs.  The tires bite and you fly.  I'm going back to the dealer for a second one. ""A must have, enjoy!!"""
infiniti,g35,2005,Crazeebert, 05/15/2005,Love my G35!,4,"I love everything about my G35.  I picked the sedan over the coupe because it is easier to get in and out of it, especially when taking more than one passenger. It has a lot of pep, it it smooth as silk to drive and it looks sporty for a sedan. I think it is the best value on the road!"
infiniti,g35,2005,CWise1591, 05/18/2005,Best car,4,"I have just picked up my G35x yesterday. It is a very fun car to drive. I still have my Nissan Altima 2.5SL but it beats it from the bottom up. The G35x has very good pickup and audio system. The sunroof is cool and the wood tim is not cheap. Alot of people say the brakes give off alot of dust, but it is hard to see because the wheels are aluminum. I like the 6 speed manuelmatic. And the all wheel drive. Also the reclinding seats as well. Still need to figure out some more stuff."
infiniti,g35,2005,J B, 05/17/2005,Best Bang for your Buck,4,"While researching mid-size sedans under $35,000, I found that the 2005 G35 sedan is ""hands down"" the best value. While in all honesty I would rather be driving the BMW 3 series, by the time you add on all the features that come standard on the G35 (such as leather) to the 3 series, you're looking at at least a $5,000 difference.  The G35's handling, while not as tight as the BMW's, is quite capable of almost anything you can throw at it.  All in all, if you're looking to stay under $35k, the G35 is your best bet. I am very happy with the G35's handling, acceleration, and appearance."
infiniti,g35,2005,Carl, 05/18/2005,"So far, so good",4,"Positives:  Great car, overall.  Exceptional power and comfort.  Good visibility for changing lanes and backing.  Various climate and stereo controls take some getting use to but make sense once mastered.  My AWD X model is great in snow and the best thing going for slippery roads.  The G35 is much more stable in dicey road conditions than my former Audi Quattro.  Negatives:  Optional mud guards do not prevent stone chips from occuring between the rear wheel wells and rear doors.  Paint quality is a bit shabby.  Dealer service rep (Elk Grove California) was not at all helpful with respect to addressing a couple of issues that I brought up during the 3,500 mile service."
infiniti,g35,2005,Larry Levine, 05/18/2005,Luxury Sports Car,5,"This car is for someone who demands luxury but wants the fun of a sports car. The exterior is sharp. I have many people taking a second look. It is fast,roomy and has some nice features. I previously owned a Lexus GS 400 and I know I made the right decision to trade in the Lexus for the Infinity."

I've been driving a boat (Suburban) for so long, I forgot what acceleration was! Love the looks of this car, and the handling can't be beat!  Every morning when I start it up, a get that great, hearty HUMMMMM, it's awesome!  My mom has an 05 BMW 5 series, and when she drove my G35 sedan, she said ""I could have saved $18,000 and been really happy with this car!""  "

infiniti,g35,2005,John Mc, 06/01/2005,Nearly Perfect,4,"Had difficulty finding ""the car"", but when I did, I bought it. Athens Blue 6MT with just about everything. Very stiff at first, but had become 'normal' in 5K miles. Absolutely no problems. Fit and finish is flawless. The Nav. system is obviously a carryover from the Japanese Skyline since the joystick is on the right, making for a bit of a reach. Driver seat bolsters are little tight for a 280# person, but are molding with time. Seat adjustment switches need to be moved as do the seat heater switches. Car is a definite head turner. Infiniti did a beautiful job with the car. It is a joy to drive. Only wish LA freeways were less congested. One trip to San Diego was a kick. "
infiniti,g35,2005,loads of fun!, 06/02/2005,Loads of Fun,4,I really enjoy driving this car. Being in sales and on the road alot the Sirius radio is a god send. The fast pick up getting on and off highways is great. As far as styling this car is a looker this is a sexy car even with 4 doors. 
infiniti,g35,2005,timsit, 06/11/2005,fast and un- furious,4,Just purchased the G35 coupe with prem. pkg. It's an absolute blast to drive! Great performance and great looks - you can't beat it for the price. The car is great overall although a few minor things could use improvement.
infiniti,g35,2005,cybercodge, 06/11/2005,Best ever,4,"Best ever auto I've ever owned, and I have owned many.  The blending of performance and luxury at slightly over 30k can't be touched by any other vehicle on the road today."
infiniti,g35,2005,CTKath, 06/12/2005,I LOVE this car!,4,"When my son suggested that I look into the Infiniti G35x for an AWD car, I admit, I'd never heard of it.  I was leaning toward an ES330.  I am so glad that I listened to him - I adore this car!  Everything about it - the engine, the styling, the color (Lakeshore Slate).  I am so proud to be driving it.  I didn't go for the wood interior and I'm glad, I like the brushed aluminum better.  I like the size too, not too big (I traded in a 1999 Avalon) and not too small (I was test-driving a C320 4matic).  I did get the satellite radio, but am considering not subscribing anymore because I don't get enough use out of it.  My oil change was a snap.  No problems - love this car!"
infiniti,g35,2005,Mirusen, 06/14/2005,Best value for the money,4,"Truly fun to drive, excellent handling and best value for the money in its class.

infiniti,g35,2005,HB VB 24, 06/24/2005,Soooo much value,4,"For those that like to drive, this sedan is almost impossible to beat.  As fast & roomy as a 545i, for literally half the price.  Spent the last 7 years wishing my otherwise perfect Maxima was RWD, and now I've got it!  Many minor improvements in 05 made this car worth the wait.  Basically a 4 door 350Z, with a better interior, to boot.  Just a great combination of features to bring the true ""four door sports car"" back to Nissan/Infiniti "
infiniti,g35,2005,kevinms99, 06/28/2005,Another happy owner,4,"I've had the G35x since a few weeks prior to Thanksgiving.  I came from a Pontiac Trans Am, so I'm slowly moving toward more ""reasonable"" cars. The ride of the car is quite smooth.  It is quiet when it is supposed to be and loud when I want it to be.  I find the styling to be smooth and a bit understated (quite a difference from my previous car). I've had no problems at all with the car, and I hope to continue being a happy owner."
infiniti,g35,2005,G - Maniac, 06/29/2005,Holy cow!,4,"I Just purchased a new G 35 with the premium and sport packages and  it does not disappoint.  This car is everything magazines have been raving about and MORE!  It is now clear why BMW needs to revamp its 3 series to remain competitive in this market segment.  If you are looking for a a luxury sports car that moves like you would not believe, looks great, and will not break the bank, then the G35 (NOT THE 330) is what you should buy.  As far as I am concerned, this is the new  benchmark in this car segment.  Time for BMW to move over! "
infiniti,g35,2005,Martin, 06/30/2005,I would stay with Infiniti!,4,"This is my first ""luxury"" car, and I couldn't be happier with my choice. The Infiniti G35X is comfortable, handles splendidly, and has the acceleration needed to deal with everyday traffic. Of course, a weekend drive in the mountains is not much of a challenge for my G. Count me as one very satisfied Infiniti driver."

Started with a 240sx and worked up through Altima, Maxima and finally to the Infinity G35x. The move from the Maxima to the G35  was like coming into the Light. The car is tight, nimble and fast... almost too fast for my wife (but she really loves the ""pickup"") she just has to be somewhat carefull with the ""Fast pedal""  In the pasty weeks I've driven it about 1000 highway miles and love tooling up and down the Merritt Pkwy in CT going to/from Boston. The ""G ""holds the road   and goes where and when I want it too. For me, dollar for dollar it's  the Best Value out there. Even better than the Maxima- which was a great value. "

The look, style & appearence deceives the unaware of the power and handling in the X model.  The keyless entry & ignition to the wrap-around console & driver seat make the driver feel confortable & in control. The throaty sound at start to the powerful accelaration makes driving this car FUN! There is plenty of head & leg room, reclining seats in the back & I upgraded to the Bose sound system. The rosewood console & leather bucket seats give the interior a finished look. The brakes are touchy until you adjust to them & the materials on the dash aren't of the highest quality   "

The interior is not that gaudy shiny plastic wood stuff everywhere, in fact, since the car is sporty, I opted to skip any wood interior.  I find everything within reach and very accessible.  I opted for the aero package.  Cruising down the road at 85 is like a dream.  I love this car."

The door was completely sheared off. I was saved by the heavy steel bars installed by their manufacturer. They had to be sawed off. Air bags to the side of me went off, along with above the door where glass shattered.  Officers were so amazed of this vehicle's safety feature, they were asking my son, what make of car was is? The car was totalled. "

This truly represents what a sports sedan is all about, nothing is compromised in this car. Style, room and performance....I really thought I was not missing much from the '02 Maxima...but was I wrong. Handling is amazing and to have rwd again is bliss. Someone asked me why I just didn't get another Maxima or a Acura TL and I started to explain, then I thought if I have to explain, they will never get it."
infiniti,g35,2005,LUV my G35, 07/22/2005,Great Performer,5,"This is one of the best handling cars I have ever had. The weight balance , front to rear is aerodynamic, transmission shifts smoothly and it has plenty of power."

They never did that with my old Honda Civic, I'll tell you that. Exterior design is beautiful, although I prefer the coupe styling the 2005 revision was a nice upgrade. Interior needs slight improvement but it is better than last year. The drive is nice & smooth. The ride is clean & comfortable, what you expect from an luxury vehicle. Also, when you want you can kick in the sport aspect with the 280 horsepower. It's a beautiful car & my friends with a new BMW 3 series or Audi A4 series are regretting their purchases now."

You will be instantly sold on the G35. I drove them all none of the others could even come close to the class-dominating performance, head-turning styling, amenities, and best overall value for your dollar.  I've had my G for 5 months now and have LOVED every second of it. I know you will too!!!  This car is at its best when cruising long highway miles - just set the cruise and go."

Overall really enjoy the drive.  
infiniti,g35,2005,trkpts, 08/31/2005,A Fun Vehicle,4,"Great car for the price and great performance. Other reviews complain about gas mileage but that's the trade off for the performance. I've only had the car four months, but no complains so far. If I could change anything on the car it would be only two things. A little more interior storage space, it has several compartments but they are small. The other would be another few inches of leg room for the rear passengers, if the front seats are all the way back tere isn't a lot of leg room back there. I have people in my office that have bought BMW's and Acura's and they seem to like the futures on the Infiniti more than there own cars "
infiniti,g35,2005,fallenm0nk, 09/11/2005,My first car,4,Not bad for a first car. I love the way it looks and feels. For all those who complain about how its a rough ride... you need to realize that this is a sports car and its SUPPOSED to feel that way. Don't listen to what the dealer/sticker says abouth mileage. They say 19/26 but its really more like 22 mpg MAX.

The car has a sexy appeal unlike others, the comfort is ideal, and the ride exceptional.  However, turn the VDC (vehicle dynamic control) and the 298 Hp engine shows you what it's all about!!  This car is a MUST have!  The gas mileage could be a little better, but hey feel the torque.  VERY satisfied, and I'd buy the car all over again. "
infiniti,g35,2005,Michael W, 09/26/2005,Amazing,4,"I purchased my g35 coupe used at 27k. It has prem and nav pkgs but no sports because i live in nyc. I test drove one w/ a sports package and found it way too stiff. The handling limits of non-sports pkg are beyond anything i'd approach + the ride is better. The GPS is a lifesaver and is one of the best in the world. Very few cards can beat it in a straight line but most imporantly is the attention the exterior + exhaust gets. All of it's competitors (330Ci, Acura CL, etc) blend into the crowd. The G35C is like an exotic car on the road. Every occasion i have to drive it is welcomed. Going to get groceries is fun. I've had it only for a few days and i've already recieved many many compliemnts"

This car out performs BMW, Lexus, Audi, Acura, MB & others. I drove them all before buying this. Regardless of price this IS the car. It's quick, Fun and I don't see a problem with the gas mileage as I hear from others. You expect this when you buy a car in this class."

I get mad when i go to sleep or have to go to work because that is taking away my G time. The ""American Skyline"" is a superb machine and was my choice over a Subaru WRX STI and the Evolution 8. Both cars may be a bit quicker, but there aren't words to describe the feeling you get when you drive the G35. The handling is great at above average speeds and acceleration is remarkable. I would only buy this car in a manual for the simple fact that I don't think you can get the full effect of it in an auto or auto-stick. Great buy for the money. "
infiniti,g35,2005,IOSPro, 10/11/2005,"Yeah, It's All That",4,"The G35 6M is everything a car should be.  It's a performance car w/ luxury, not the other way round.   It has a nice growl when pushed, but quite when cruising.  All the niceties are there and well designed.  The car fits you like your favorite sneakers.  The mp3 player is very nice and the Navi cannot be beat.  I had to buy winter tires which was a drag, but the 18 do look fine.  The clutch has a very quick engagement point, and was hard to adjust to after 20 years of Saabs clutches.  The environmental system is the best, arctic in the summer and toasty in the winter.  VSC works very well in the rain (not tested yet in snow).  Much research went into this choice, I would buy again!"
infiniti,g35,2005,tbski, 10/20/2005,A great value compared to the 3 series,4,"The G35X is the perfect blend of luxury and performance. I had resigned myself to the 3 series until I discovered the G35. What was lacking in the BMW I found in the Infiniti. When considering price, reliability, size and style the G35X has it all over the 3 series. This car screams and is a blast to drive. I hope the AWD proves to be a worthwhile investment this winter."
infiniti,g35,2005,Antone, 10/20/2005,Antons new AWD G25x,4,"The G25x is the best performing car I've ever owned with cars like Trans Am, Dodge Daytona and Grand Prix GTPs included.  It zips to 100 like nothing and stops on a dime.  Going around clover leafs with 25 mph speed limits can easily be doubled to 50.  And when it gets wet by rain or snow its hard to even get the wheels to spin with hard acceleration.  Best car purchase I ever made."
infiniti,g35,2005,BlackG, 10/25/2005,Performance and Value at its best,4,"The 6MT G35 coupe has the perfect balance of luxury and performance.  You can easily cruise around the city with the quietness and quality feel of luxury with a nice low hum of the exhaust reminding you that there is an animal inside when pushed.  The car is smooth but can be rough at times (sport- tuned suspension and 19"" rims) but I love the feel of the road, I feel so connected.  The engine response is immediate and braking is superb.  Handling is on par with the best in its class.  Don't expect this car to have the luxury feel of a Lexus (interior- wise and quiet) it wasn't design that way and Infiniti did a great job balancing both performance and luxury. It's all about the experience."
infiniti,g35,2005,Jason, 10/27/2005,Dad's toy,4,"As a father to be I was looking for a car that would satisfy all of the family.  The G35 6MT Sedan has exceeded all of those expectations.  The fun to drive factor, safety and enough room for the baby to ride in style.  The power has been fantastic in comparison to a 2003 Saab 93.  88 horses makes a world of difference and it is great be back in a rear wheel drive car again.  The handling has been superior with the 18 inch wheels and the sport tuned suspension.  I'm somewhat concerned considering we faced snow on October 25th.  The snow tires are on the way."
infiniti,g35,2005,pajayhawk, 10/28/2005,G35,4,"I love this car. Interior features and layout provide lots of perks: storage I didn't know I needed, plug-ins for phone charging and satelite radio, logical and appropriate settings for controls. Speed and handling are a real plus. Pep and acceleration whenever it is needed. Handles better than the RX8 and BMW 3 series. Provides simultaneous sporty and luxurious ride."
infiniti,g35,2005,Eric, 10/29/2005,Great choice,4,This car has been great to drive-plenty of zip with a great sporty sound too. The only problem was an early issue with the transmission control valve.  That's been replaced and the car has been great.  It gets plenty of positive comments from people who see it.
infiniti,g35,2005,Blake, 11/01/2005,Lovin' it,4,"I got my G35 for my college graduation present and I LOVE IT!  Its just beautiful to look at.  I like driving it too!  Mine is silver/ grey interior w/ sport package.  The sport package is a plus because the 18' wheels are nice.  I like how the car hugs the road around corners and is definitely a head turner.  I've had my car for 3.5 months and I already have 4,000 miles. Had a small problem with the cup holder but my Infiniti dealer got me a new one. Troncalli Infiniti in Atlanta where I got my car was great but I recently visited Infiniti of Nashville and the service was horrible.  Plus they charged me $50 for just an oil change.  Other then that, I'm lovin' my car."
infiniti,g35,2005,Brian, 11/04/2005,Good car but..............,4,"I drove all of the competition (BMW, Acura, etc) and to be completely honest, I would rather be driving a 3- series. However, there is no denying the fact that this car presents incredible value for the money. This car is literally 7 to 8 grand less than a comparable BMW. But some days I like it and others I don't. I have had the car for 3 to 4 months and there are squeaks and rattles creeping up which is simply unacceptable for a car like this. The car does have great features, exterior styling is very nice, and it is very comfortable. Gas mileage isn't great but I wouldn't really expect it with nearly 300hp. "
infiniti,g35,2005,Nakos2000, 11/09/2005,Great Car,4,"I finally did it! I bought a 2005 G35 sedan! I am very happy with this car. Much better driver than 2006 IS, Acura TL, and more power than BMW engines. Build quality feels great and updated exterior styling for 2005 is very well done. Regret not getting the navigation, but I got a great deal on this vehicle and I love to drive it!"
infiniti,g35,2005,Boone, 11/19/2005,"Style, Power, Buzz?",4,"No question, the body style is elegant yet understated. This is a good for unassuming people who like quality things. (The Infiniti design team is clearly outperforming their competitors by serving products that are visually distinctive.) As far as engine power, it is a nice feeling knowing you can safely get around just about anybody or anything before they know it. Overall, I feel I am getting great value for what I paid."
infiniti,g35,2005,David, 12/09/2005,great,4,"great style, luxury all you could ask for.  The car has horsepower and torque. I like the way the car handles and the looks I get when driving.  Getting used to all the controls take some time, but the owners manual is very helpful.  I would recommend this car for anyone and I am am old mopar man from years back.  This car is actually my wife's car and she picked it out and I reluctantly said ok after researching it.  She loves the car and the power, speed, and the style the most.  This is our first car that is not a domestic vehicle and now I am convinced of the quality and reliability of this vehicle so that the next vehicle, meaning mine may be in the Infiniti design.  We a re very happy."
infiniti,g35,2005,Dave, 12/15/2005,"Still new, but should be fun",4,"Ok, I've only had it for a very short period but the car is really fun to drive.

infiniti,g35,2005,maa1978, 01/01/2006,"a drivers car, watch out bmw",4,"Drive this car the way it was made to be driven when you test drive the G35.  You will be disappointed if you want luxurious feel. (not a g35).  RWD is one of the main reasons I bought the car.  Take notice that Lexus or Acura isn't in in the comparos with Infinity, BMW, Caddilac in most of the car magazines.  You soon realize the G35 is all buisness when push the car hard and you unleash the hidden beast. The 6MT model is even more of a value.  I know it doesn't drive 100% like a BMW, nor does it cost like one either.  I bought this car for the long haul so I have little worries when the warranty runs out.  Don't expect Civic gas mileage your getting 298hp not 98hp.  I love this car!"
infiniti,g35,2005,raizelgs, 02/07/2006,G35 Coupe,4,"This is a great car.  It handles well (sport-tuned suspension) although it is a little harsh.  It looks great, and its styling is slightly understated - no sculpting along the sides."
infiniti,g35,2005,Jim, 02/25/2006,Awesome Car,5,I love everything about the G35 6MT except driving in the snow.  The G35 handles the curves and has great acceleration.  The car looks great and is a ton of fun to drive.  Great BOSE sound system and love the tilt/telescoping steering wheel.
infiniti,g35,2005,Teranko, 03/15/2006,Great coupe,4,"I'm totally impressed with this car.  It is quick, responsive and a shear pleasure to drive.  I'm a little disappointed with the available headroom, as I am with most imports.  Other than that, no complaints."
infiniti,g35,2005,Murphy, 03/27/2006,Eye Catcher,4,I have owned this car for approximately 7 months and it is the best purchast I have ever made. It will pass anything but a gas station...but as my father has always said if you can afford the car you can afford the gas. You get many looks when driving this car so don't be penny foolish and flip for the chrome wheels and spoiler it makes a huge difference...It is not that quick off the start but once you get it going jumping from 70 to 100 in 5th is exhilarating just pick your moments the tickets add up...what else well it is an extremely smooth ride compared to its sister car the Z350 and it does have a back seat that is a plus and the trunk is good size for a sports car...
infiniti,g35,2005,My Fist Sports Car, 04/12/2006,Speedy,4,I got this car and it was so fun to drive that i could not get out of it. People kept saying that the car smelled good after 4 months. Love the AWD cuz it gets you out of everythings no matter how high the snow is. Exhaust note is very nice but not too annoying. Been back at dealer twice for noises but not fixed due to window bolts not tight and brake tune up.

I got mine in black with black leather, and I feel like a rock star every time I get behind the wheel.  My manual 6-speed transmission G accelerates so fast I almost have to hold on to the steering wheel! I've taken her up to 120+ mph on the open road, and she just purrs.  The one and only drawback to the G is the high performance tires: they are pricey!  Other than that, I have zero complaints. Nothing has ever gone wrong (even a little) and it is just a joy to drive. I love the car and I would swear she loves me back."

The interior finishes are very nice, and I think Infiniti has improved on the finsihes for 2005.  The car was well assembled.  There are no squeaks or rattles.  I do find fault with a few design failures; namely, the car doors do not automatically lock when either placed in Drive or when reaching 9 mph as the VW and Audi doors do.  Also, the memory seats do not include the side view mirror settings.  I park in a garage in NYC, and I always get the car back with the mirrors changed.  It is a slight inconvenience to reset, but at this price, it should have been a simple programming job."

Steering is precise if not a bit too stiff. If you live in the north beware, the car is terrible in snow. I also have the Nav system and without the touch screen, it is much less user friendly the the one in my '01 Acura CL.  You really have to pull over to change virtually any setting.

Midrange power is outstanding and the long wheel base and stiff chassis gives  confidence during hard cornering.   The car also has an elegant and ssophisticated feel or demeanor.  The slow rifle bolt 6 speed shifter, weighty steering feel and slightly soft brake pedal leans more towards luxury than sport.

But none came close to performance of the G35 (except the 330 which cost thousands more). More importantly, the complaints made about the 04 model have been addressed in the 05! Steering wheel controls now illuminate, horsepower is up to 280, and the steering wheel telescope is now power operated with memory seat.

This car is my daily driver, and I drive it hard.
I prefer sportiness over cush rides, but still like a bit of luxury so this car really fit the bill.

The good:  The car handles well, superb acceleration and braking.  The automatic transmission has been reliable, although a little bumpy between 1st and 2nd.  The styling of course is unparalleled.  The interior technology package has worked well - the navigation is spot-on - a little awkward to use with the joystick inputs, but not bad for 2006.  The Bluetooth has never failed though 4 iPhones.  It connects every time, and the voice input is about 95% accurate.  The audio system - CD changer, speakers work perfectly to this day.  Electronic seat warmer and adjusters have not failed.

The bad:  Interior components have been cheap.  There have been a few gimpy components.  The removable cupholder - very cheap and the spring broke after about 2 years.  The DC socket has failed about 3-4 times.  Driver window motor had to be replaced after 125k miles.  The tire pressure sensor had to be replaced after 90k miles.  After 80k miles, leather covering the door panels are starting to peel off, and after 120k miles, the leather on the side panels in the back have completely peeled off (and nobody ever sits back there).  

The ugly: Tires - need to be replaced every 20-30k.  

Overall I like this car.  Performance is very reliable.  I have not had many huge problems with the vehicle, however there are numerous small fixes for the car.  The car is very tough on the tires (and I have a stock 18"" wheels).

The stiffer sport suspension could have matched better the M3's cornering, but the whole experience makes me easily forget.

infiniti,g35,2006,OzmanWizard, 01/07/2019,Worth Every Penny,5,"This car's best characteristics are real wheel drive, acceleration, performance and handling.  I bought mine CPO in 2007 with about 16k miles and now I'm at 104k miles.  The hums today the same as it did when I first purchased it.  Repairs are almost non existent - it's overall engine and transmission quality are excellent.  It's one of those cars where you get ""bored"" in that  it starts every time and runs excellent.  I've  had a few wear and tear repairs, brakes, fuel pump  but pretty much every other repair has been routine maintenance.  It has amazing pickup.  If you're seeking an excellent used car that will hit 200k miles, this is one of only a few cars that can do that.  The only pet peeve I have is the interior leather.  After 100k miles the arm rest has developed a rip, the inside leather panel that connects to the arm rest was only glued on and the leather has separated from the door panel (poor design)  and the dash has a small crack in it.  Mind you I've lived primarily in Texas with a brief  time in Florida so it's been in high heat environments.  However,  The door panel issue is really irritating.  Having said that, when you drive it, the G35 is incredibly responsive and drives like a dream.  This is a performance car so you're  going to feel connected to the road - it's not a luxury ride but a sporty drive.
"
infiniti,g35,2006,g35dave, 04/06/2017,Well designed sports sedan,4,"I bought my G35 used with only 12k miles and now it has 101k.  I love the design of the G35, both inside and out.   The interior is very classy and sleek.  I think the later updates like the G37 lost some of the good looks.  The performance is fun, and though the car feels heavy on the road, it's fun to drive, and the engine sound is great.   It jumps off the line, but the AT shifting isn't the smoothest.  I've been disappointed by the gas mileage, often around 16mpg in the city and 24 on the highway.  With climate change out of control and oil companies controlling our government, I hate giving money to those sociopaths.  My next car will be electric.  You can't rotate the tires, so they don't last super long.  It has some serious blind spots you need to be aware of.   And there are a few problem areas that pop up - control arm bushings go bad, brakes don't last too long and tend to squeal, a bad cam shaft sensor recently made my car die on the freeway, truck release wire snapped, miscellaneous electrical issues, and a lot of random rattles and ticks in the dashboard that can't be located or silenced.  I wouldn't say it's unreliable, but it's not the most reliable car I've owned.  My wife has a bad back and the passenger seat isn't comfortable for her.  All these issues aside, I've really enjoyed the car and don't regret buying it.

infiniti,g35,2006,yogiowner, 08/17/2011,Replaced Transmission with less than 40k miles. Manufacturer has no influence over dealership,2,"My car is almost five years old. I tried to keep it in tip top condition. It has less than 50k miles, I changed oil regularly, changed tires, fluids, etc.

Went through FOUR dealerships. NONE of them did what I asked. Three of them tried to fleece me. One drove my car for eleven miles, when i brought it in for a manufacturer's recall item. Then they came back with some nonsense repairs they wanted to make, that weren't needed.

After replacing the transmission, the starter is malfunctioning. Instead of doing the thorough check I asked for, they want me to bring it in for a scheduled maintenance next month. Can you say FRAUD! Don't know what to do next, but I will do something"
infiniti,g35,2006,anusin, 04/29/2019,"Fun, quick, reliable if taken care of",4,"I bought mine used from someone who let it sit for a while and did not take very good care of it. The car had 152000 miles on it and definitely needed some work. The suspension was shot, window motor didn't work, passenger going out now as well, ac stopped working after a month, ac belt snapped as well, interior seems loose like everything is not tight together and shakes and rattles when not on a brand new road.  The transmission is slipping so needs a new transmission but could just be because of poor care from previous owners. 02 sensors needed replacing, the cat converters need replacing. Basically it would be a great car if taken care of properly. After fixing Check Engine Light and all major problems except the transmission the car feels solid so if you plan on buying one that has over 100000 miles on it then I would ask a lot of questions about whether it was properly maintained because if not then everything starts to go out. Fun car to drive, poor gas mileage and consumes a lot of oil. Recommended getting a oil catch can and a plenum spacer to fix the manufacture defect of poor air intake to valves. If wanting to put an aftermarket stereo in you have to buy a special dash din that has ac controls on it and it is like 150 dollars. Overall I dont think it has a very good resale value compared to how much it costs to fix common wear and tear problems so I definitely would not buy if your wanted to fix and resale, its more of a fix for yourself deal.

infiniti,g35,2006,Look Good, Think Twi,think twice before you buy,1,"The G35 Infinity is reliable. The Bose system is excellent. The front end is solid but the steering is poor. The engine has some power but the high-end torque is non-existent! If you like the exterior styling then this is the only good said about the G35. Everything else falls below average. If engine, steering, suspension, brakes, vision, and all the other characteristics about any car are all good then one would think that the car is all good, right? Wrong! And very wrong at that! It is how everything works in coherence that is of 100% importance, and this car (G35) has nothing working in coherence! American, German cars will be honest with gas mileage, Infinity will not. Think Twice!"
infiniti,g35,2006,BlownVQ, 12/13/2009,Performance + Reliable,5,"Very Reliable, never had to use the warranty.  You will eventually get used to the stock 298hp.  Add a turbo or Supercharger and these cars are the best bang for the buck reliable luxury sports car available for under 30k!  Getting in and out of the back seat is not really intended for adults, but thats not why your reading this review is it?  My Vortech supercharged G35 gets 18mpg city 23mpg highway, really good for 400+hp and its just about stock mpg! (Depends on how you drive)"

Almost got Acura TL / BMW 328i when I decided on the infiniti. Out-drives, out-corners, and out-performs the competition. Make no mistake, this is a sports car, don't expect it to be anything else. Excellent suspension (STIFF) and power that rivals a Porsche cayman which I just recently drove.  Car turns into a different beast at 100+mph and drives as well/if not better than MB E or C class sedan. Clutch is touchy and difficult at first with the electric throttle, but anyone who likes to glide through the gears will love it eventually.  Good car, if it fits your mission."

The AWD is AMAZING in the Utah snow storm, handles by far better and feels more secure than our newer Expeditions AWD system. I was skeptical as there is only one Infiniti dealership in Utah to service the car, but they have been amazing to work with. Always take care of me and are fair. The car is quick, agile and makes a nice healthy growl. Very posh ride and my friends LOVE that the rear seats recline making it a blast on longer road trips. "

This was also over $5000 cheaper than 07s with 50,000 miles! I test drove used 3 Series, an IS 250 and a Subaru Legacy.  I thought this car handled better than all of them and only the Subaru was cheaper.  Fun to drive, extremely comfortable and an excellent value."

I really like the modern dash treatment. The motorized pop-up nav system is also a really neat feature since I prefer not to see the screen unless I need directions (in my opinion it's a shame this won't be carried over in the 2007 redesign). Some people have complained about the quality of the interior materials and I have to agree that that was one things that held me back from buying this car in 2003 and 2004, but Infiniti has done a lot to remedy this complaint in 2006.  I won't say that the interior is up to Audi quality, but it doesn't feel cheap anymore.    "

It handles great and has incredible power and acceleration. As expected, the only draw back is the fuel economy. Depending on how I drive it ranges from 13 mpg to 24 mpg. Generally, I get about 15 to 17 mpg, so no real complaints. Overall a great car well worth the price!"

You can feel all four wheels grab in the wet, but it retains a rear-wheel dynamic on dry pavement. The ""cockpit"" feels comfortably snug for my 5'10"", 220 lb frame. Steering is tight and responsive. I do conciously avoid potholes: the sporty suspension will clearly transmit the bump to the occupants. The motor's burble at idle and roar when accelerating makes you feel like you have a sports car and not a sedan. The stereo is loud and clear. The SmartKey is somewhat cool, but leaves me to wonder if the vehicle is at greater risk for theft if I'm ""around"" the car, but not in the car--I do need to look into that more. MPG-feh."

However, the neighboor of mine had just purchased the G35 asked if I'd like to test drive a real muscle car... Yeah, right ??? Boy, was I surprised to admit it seemed at least twice as powerful as my BMW was. Well, I figured the all new 330 will prove me wrong. Unfortunately, it didn't :((( Not to mentioned the not-so-good- looking shape lots of folks are complaining about this time around.

It is spacious inside, easy to park, complements a professional image, and absolutely screams off the line.  We got the electronic automatic transmission with manual shiftability, but I rarely use it.  The auto does a good job on its own.

The motor in this vehicle is all about acceleration and revving to the redline. Sure, fuel economy is not good, but it gets better as the miles go by. We're now getting about 21 mpg combined highway and city driving. That may not sound too good but you have to be realistic when considering the fact that you have a sports car engine under the hood.

I also notice some more power. The Eibach springs really help for cornering and braking along with a very nice ride, the faster you go, the smoother it gets! The traction control works well with the 'drive-by-wire' by cutting engine power to perfectly hold a turn, when it senses the tires are hooking up again, it hammers the power back in pushing you to your seat, getting your heart rate up, adrenaline flowing, and after the turn is over, the sweats and tingles! A wild rush. The seats are wonderful. Plenty of power. Gas mileage is not too good if you get on it!!"

It ain't no BMW.
The interior is kinda cheesy, the clutch is horrible and the seat belts don't retract.

Don't get me wrong, I love it but I'm just not passionate about it.
The reason I picked it over an E46 M3 was the reliability.
Having the check engine light come on every other week on the M3 was a little frustrating.

infiniti,g35,2006,G, 07/01/2008,Hard to beat!,4,"I bought a 2006 G35 sedan 6MT new in December of 2005.  I now have 61k on it and it's doing great.  Very quick, smooth V6, 298hp.  The only rear drive manual car I could find under $40k that had any performance to it.  I previously had a 1999 BMW 328i with performance and luxury packages.  Loved the car, but had electrical glitches?  The Infiniti is worry free and the dealer experience has been great!  Light grey (stone) interior stays dirty though. I'm buying a new 2009 G in the fall... to bad it won't be the G37 sedan!!!"
infiniti,g35,2006,TDS, 07/11/2008,Great Car!,4,Very nice power with the 3.5L V6 @ 280hp also handles well. I've been avg. 22-24 MPG.
infiniti,g35,2006,Ace814, 07/24/2008,Great Car,4,"I've had my '06 G35 sedan 6MT for about 3 months and I am loving it so far.  Comfortable, great exterior, great engine.  I would love to install a supercharger to bump it from the 298 hp to 440 hp but it's finding someone I trust to do it.  I don't trust myself with the install, this motor is more advanced than I'm used to.  But I am having fun with it anyway.  Seems to be very well built seeing as how this is my first Infiniti.  So far so good!"
infiniti,g35,2006,Jase, 12/17/2008,#1,4,"I bought a used 2006 G35 coupe this past Saturday and it drives great. I recommend a black leather interior; very clean feel. I have a silver exterior but I plan to get a paint job to black soon. Black on black ""look-at- me"" factor."
infiniti,g35,2006,NEPA Driver, 12/20/2008,2006 Infiniti G35 x,4,"Love this car.  Have owned luxury SUVs, Audi, BMW and this is my favorite.  It has pickup I could not believe.  What acceleration.  As for the gas mileage, I don't know why people are complaining.  First, its AWD so expect less. Also use good brand name gas, at least the mid- grade.  I get 20-21 MPG on mixed street and highway drives. Plus this thing is excellent in snow.  Just push the Snow Button and off you go."
infiniti,g35,2006,Cowher, 01/27/2009,G35 has opened my eyes,4,"I got this car after my 2006 Audi TT 225 Quattro's transmission died 3 times in one month. I bought it because I liked the new nissan 6cyl altima coupe. This was just as nice and was a large percent cheaper. I have owned saab, Audi and many other euro cars. For the price this car gives great performance looks and reliability. I put hankook ipike snow tires on it and I have powered through some of the worst new England snow storms this winter with ease. All in all when this car is dead I will most likely get another or go to the G37. I love this car!"
infiniti,g35,2006,Dan, 01/28/2009,LOVE IT,4,"I've had this car for about a year now and I still love it. This car is not for everyone. If you typically drive SUVs or Accords you will hate this car. If you are an enthusiast you will never want to get out of it. Some people may have only bought it because of its sexy look and are not people who want a driver's car. It has loud tires, stiff ride and is small. In return you get a car with tight, predictable handling and a sweet exhaust note that will always put a smile on your face. "
infiniti,g35,2006,Jared, 03/20/2009,2006 Infiniti G35x w Premium,4,"I really do love this car. I did a lot of research after owning a 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer. I was after a clean modern looking car with the gadgets. It has premium Bose with the sub. Get it. It has the bluetooth which I like. I know it didn't have an ipod adapter but knew of a unit I could buy for $100 online and had Best Buy install for $50. This is a must too. You can control your ipod through the steering wheel. Overall, great pickup, performance, good in snow, good reliability so far. I bought it used and may have picked a different color other than grey. That's it. Love this car. Now my wife wants one."
infiniti,g35,2006,Jason Hearn, 02/04/2010,A blast to drive,4,Acceleration is nice but could use a little more in gears 1-3. Passing is no problem and taking corners is fun as the car just sticks to the road. The shifting is a little unrefined and you really feel it in both the stick and the clutch. Overall comfort is nice and you sit nice and low to the ground. Drink holders on the manual are not in the easiest place to reach and drinks can get in the way when your shifting.
infiniti,g35,2006,Infiniti G, 02/27/2010,OMG!!!! Yes Yes,4,"Bought used with 12k in 2007, now has 42k &love it.Has every available option.Tight twisty roads are a dream to drive.Made many people scream railing into a corner then laugh like a kid with thrill that the car stayed planted firm and ready for more. Amazing brakes will force the blood to your cheeks.Dealer support is far superior to my piece of junk BMW.Called dealer to see about a warning light and techs very helpful, just needed brake pads (oem only $82),brake sensor is well designed also has built in tool on rotor that will release rotor in seconds.Installed cold air intake, it added noticeably more power on bottom and sounds sweet!No problems.Bose audio is great with no distortion at loud levels."
infiniti,g35,2006,Doug, 05/05/2010,Can you say power?,4,"Bought this car used with only 6K and have 30K now.  It has a fantastic engine, great looks, sporty to drive and except for fuel economy, is a knock out 10 IMO.  I can't say enough about the pick up and acceleration from this Infiniti engine.  They really got it right.  The 6 speed is also fun with my needing to get on the interstate just to get it out of 5th gear.  The interior is well laid out with all the bells and whistles.  Got the red color version and it looks great too.  I don't need to compare with BMW, I found my ideal car in the Infiniti and will stick with that.  If you're looking to spoil yourself, this is definitely the car to look for.  "
infiniti,g35,2006,johnra72, 05/07/2010,Fun to drive,4,"I love this car.  I usually get a new car ever four years or so but I am planning on keeping this car for at least one and maybe two more years.  It has great power, and the handling is excellent.  All with decent fule economy. In 1965 I had a GTO with tri power carbs and  a four speed manual transmission. My G35 would run rings around the GTO in every department including acceleration.  Amazing for a 6 cylinder car."
infiniti,g35,2006,gatillo21, 06/15/2010,BMW 3 series killer,4,"You'll love this car. It has performance, style, interior space and good features like standard 6 disk CD changer. I wanted to get the Lexus IS 350 but the G35 offered me more for less. If you want performance, All wheel drive for the snow and comfort this is the best option. "
infiniti,g35,2006,Brett, 02/19/2008,Great car!,4,"I bought my coupe 6MT with 15,000 miles on it about a year ago. I drive it every day and have even driven it from Michigan to California and back. It performs flawlessly and is a pleasure to drive every single day. While I think it deserves a more powerfull engine, it does ok with just shy of 300 Bhp. The exhaust note is like music but could be a bit louder. It is also a great platform for upgrades to performance. I am actually having a single turbo installed this week that will boost the hp to over 425 (crankshaft) without having to rebuild the lower end. This is a great mix of sport and luxury, I love this car!!!"
infiniti,g35,2006,Gig, 10/28/2005,Proud owner,4,"I've owned my 2005 G35 sedan  6 speed manual since January 2005, currently have just over 11,500 miles on it. I have had no problems of any type. Car handles and performs as advertised, highway driving is a real pleasure - plenty of power and quite nimble for a sedan. It's the most comfortable car I've ever owned, leather interior is great. Gas mileage could be better but with 298HP, I'm satisfied. I would rate it a 9.0 and that's only because I don't believe in 10s; you have to leave room for some improvement. The trunk would be a bit small if you plan on hauling around a family of four of five though."
infiniti,g35,2006,Murphy, 12/11/2005,Drive it!!!,4,The G35 has a much smoother ride then the Z but is not as quick off the line. The car handles beautifully and is allot of fun to drive. The lines on the car are awesome and the car definitely gets the attention of people. I am very happy with the purchase and look forward to many miles with this car.
infiniti,g35,2006,neooen, 12/14/2005,awesome,5,awesome car. don't even give it a second thought. buy it. at least for the looks you get while on road ;)
infiniti,g35,2006,Muttmart, 12/24/2005,Just Replaced a Bmw 525,4,"After driving BMW's for the past 8 years, I decided to test ride the G35x.  I'm glad I did.  The looks are great, both inside and out.  It handles great, especially around those nasty curves.  Just turn the wheel and gun it.  The car responds better than my 5 series.  The best part is that the G is it's 10 grand less expensive than the 525.  I was a BMW ""lifer"", but the G has BMW beat, hands down. "
infiniti,g35,2006,JaySunshine, 01/11/2006,Best Bang for your Buck,4,I have owned my 2006 G35 Coupe for 2 weeks now. This is a beautiful car inside and out. By far the best performance bargain available. There is no coupe remotely approaching the G's performance/luxury combination for the money. Wait for the 330 Ci and be ready to pay about 10 grand more! This car is beautiful and well built...10 years from now this will still be a handsome car.
infiniti,g35,2006,xosder, 02/04/2006,Amazing Machine,4,"This is a fantastic car. I enjoy every minute driving it. It has plenty of power, it handles better than any car that I have ever owned and comes with plenty of luxury. Bluetooth is a great feature (never have to take the phone out of my pocket). The exhaust note is awesome, very deep. Heated seats, dual climate, etc. All the features they put in are very useful. Hands down the best bang for your buck in its class."
infiniti,g35,2006,Mike, 02/08/2006,Great Car,4,I love driving this car.  I've had it about a month and have 1200 miles on it.  I came from a 2001 Saab 9-3 with tons of torque steer to the G35 with zero torque steer!  I've found about 6 different ways to get home from work that involve twisty-curvey roads.  The car has practically no body roll even when pushed hard.  I've only got to drive in the snow once but the all wheel drive made it a snap.  I'm always looking for another excuse to drive somewhere.
infiniti,g35,2006,alarict6mt, 02/07/2006,Problems at 200 miles,3,"Don't accept one without testing it thoroughly first - even a brand new one.  Bad clutch judder in first and reverse especially on hills (evident at 100 miles then getting progressively worse).  Gets worse as clutch warms.  Infiniti garage says its the same on all new 06MTs, if I had known this, I would not have bought the car.  The other two I drove did not make a banging noise when I release the clutch.  Excellent car spoiled by poor customer support - denial by mechanics and a poor clutch design or faulty components."
infiniti,g35,2006,earny, 02/26/2006,One more thing to make this car solid,4,I had the tough decision to choose between a TL and G35 sedan. Hands down the G35 is a performance oriented car and is much more fun to drive than the TL. The sport shift in the G35 is more quick to respond while the TL is basically an automatic even with the sport shift. Sound system is great when listening to CD's. Only thing I ask is better gas mileage and maybe a 6th gear to achieve the better gas mileage.
infiniti,g35,2006,ppnff, 02/26/2006,No nonsense sports sedan,4,"Traded in a 2003 Honda Accord for this vehicle, looking for better rear wheel drive handling and ability to carry the kids around.  Exhaust tone is great, subtle on freeways, but opens up to let everyone knows its presences.  Simple interior layout and design, and none of the out-of-control electonic gizmos (except it does have Bluetooth), gorgeous exterior design.  G35's price point makes other rear wheel drive vehicle look like price divas.  Love the car!  "
infiniti,g35,2006,Mama, 02/28/2006,New but Very Happy so far! Will return,4,I was very close to buying a BMW.  So far I am glad I didn't!  Love this car! It's beautiful and fun to drive.  Let's hope it lasts!! Definitely test drive one!
infiniti,g35,2006,mahtx2, 03/11/2006,G35 and Loving It!,4,"After owning a '04 Lexus RX330 with trouble from the start, I was ready for a sports adventure.  I'm exceedingly happy with my G35.  It's got a phenomenally tight drive that makes you feel like your hugging the road.  I love everything about it...the XM radio, the Nav system, bluetooth connectivity, heated seats...I can't wait to get behind the wheel and hear the growl.  As for gripes about the seat controls being unusually located, I was pleasantly surprised when I needed to move the passenger seat back for my mother, I didn't have to get out of my seat to do it.  I opted for the Sedan because the trunk is much larger, but I went in to buy the Coupe...it's in a class by itself. "
infiniti,g35,2006,henryp, 03/12/2006,happy driving,5,"I purchased this car based on consumers report and a test drive. this car handles great especially cornering. the conviences that surround the driver are just right. I have the navigation system which I,m still learning how to fully use. I find that the controls built into the steering column are great. Inow know them by feel and can keep my eyes on the road while using them. It has taken me a while to get used to not having to keep keep pulling out my keys to enter the vehicle or start it or to get in the trunk. Tomorrow will be a warm day so we are finally going to program the driver's seat and controls for my wife and myself. Visibility, handling, performance, safety are all there. thanks"
infiniti,g35,2006,eddie, 03/12/2006,Drive Drive Drive me please!,4,"This car is just begging for more action everytime I drive it. For the money best value out there, I find reasons to have to drive this thing.  Test drove everything in the class... BMW325xi, A4quattro, 9-3, TL... nothing came close to this one... so much fun to drive... handles curves like a champ... many car magazine reviews say its a bit off from the BMW when it comes to handling... but a BMW does not give you thrills like this machine does when you enter a curve at a high speed... love it so far!"
infiniti,g35,2006,J.W., 03/14/2006,EX-BMW Guy,4,"This car is so nice.  I have had two BMW 3's and an Audi A4.  This car has a nicer inside than all and faster.  A win win situation.  Get the spoiler, it is worth it..."
infiniti,g35,2006,Jim Ewing, 03/28/2006,Autocross your G35,4,"Get out there and autocross your G35, it is a blast, and the car is very competitive even with the length of the wheel base.  I have run twice in the last couple of weeks and finished ahead of all but one 350Z, all the Mustangs and Camaros and all the most of the Corvettes.  A word of warning, the stock tires on the 19 inch wheels are no match for the power exiting corners, get some Kumhos 710 on 9 x 18 in the front and 10 x 18 in the rear and strap yourself in for a great time.  Take off the traction control and go Z hunting."
infiniti,g35,2006,Joshua, 03/28/2006,A Wide Choice,4,"I just bought a 6-speed G35 and have to say I am so glad I did.  I looked at all the vehicles in this class (C230, 325, Zephyr, 9-3 Aero, and TL) and traded in my 03 CTS and am really quite happy.  Outside it looks like a million dollars.  I am 6'6"" and weigh 235 and fit fine.  I am a BP agent in AZ and drive three other guys with gear to work in absolute comfort.  The get up and go is tremendous, the drive taut and agile, and it stops on a dime (luckily for both my new car and a javelina outside of Bisbee).  It is really a nice option if you are looking to spend 30K-35K on sporty ride that can transport four adults around comfortably."
infiniti,g35,2006,mackinnr, 03/30/2006,BMW Envy,4,"A friend has had a 2002 330i for some time, so when I was to purchase a new car I was convinced the BMW was the way to go.  Boy was I wrong.  First of all 4 people cannot fit in the BMW, unless they are 4 very small people, and secondly performance wise the Infiniti is in a class by it's own.  We drove everything in the same class, the TL, the IS 350, Audi A4, etc.  Nothing comes close to the G 35 for exterior style and power.  The interior leaves something to be desired, as does the fuel economy.  If you want interior comfort go with the IS or TL, but don't expect to get 4 people in the IS, the TL is nice for grandmas. I highly recommend the sport package for bigger wheels and nicer rims. "
infiniti,g35,2006,G35owner77057, 04/06/2006,Should have bought the IS350,4,"Rattle, rattle, rattle. For a near $40k car it has more rattles and ticks than a baby's toy. I am very disappointed with this car. I should have bought the Lexus IS350 or BMW 3 series but instead took the infiniti instead (more options for less money). See what happens when you go the cheap route. Nissan should get a clue."
infiniti,g35,2006,Barry Hubbard, 04/26/2006,Youth Recaptured,4,"I liked my 2003 G35 so much I traded for a 2006 just like it.  The most noticeable difference: the brakes are just as powerful but no longer hyper- sensitive, i.e. grabby. Maneuverability and instant throttle response make highway or city driving a delight...at any speed (I had the 2003 up to 120 mph once - I won't tell you where - and it felt rock-solid).  I enjoy the 2006's added features -  high intensity headlights, dual-zone a/c, power passenger seat, and garage door opener, but they're ""gravy"" on what was already a wonderfully thought out car.  It ""fits like a glove,"" seats four comfortably, and looks the way a sport sedan ought to look.  At 68 I feel young again."
infiniti,g35,2006,ALAN, 05/06/2006,"A great car, it saved our lives.",5,We owned the infinity g35 for 6 months. It was a pleasure to drive.The gas mileage was good and the car gave a stable ride and was very reactive to road conditions. It had more than enough power and at higher speeds cornered very well. The best feature however was the safety factor! The car was involved in an accident where a car in the opposing lane crossed a median and basically tore apart the entire drivers side from front headlight to the rear panel. The front and side airbags deployed and probably saved our lives! We were the only ones that walked away from that multi car accident. The car was totaled by the insurance company..We are buying another (identical) one to replace it.

infiniti,g35,2006,Frank D, 06/20/2006,Another Winner,4,"This is my 3rd Infiniti overall, but my first car. Handles great, steering wheel very responsive, decent acceleration, a head turner!  Take the premium upgrade as it is well worth the price. The all-wheel drive is also a must at this price point so spend the extra $$.  Although I leased this car it will definitely be purchased at lease end.  Infiniti builds very reliable vehicles, I have a 2001 QX4 (65K miles) with nothing to report other than routine maintenance. Keep up the good work."

I find the 2006 to be a little more refined, a little more mature, and a little less edgy than my 2003.  It is a superb tourer for 4 people, providing a great blend of space, comfort, and performance. Initial indications are that the fuel economy will be at least as good as in my 2003 (about 22-23 mpg overall -- I don't usually have too much stop and go traffic to deal with). "

I find my self wanting to drive this car every chance I get.  I get nothing but compliments by everyone I see and know.   If I were to buy all over again, I'm not sure if I would opt for the Sport Tunes Suspension.  It can be a little stiff and noisy.  It communicates every flaw in the road.  It sticks like glue it the curves.  Interior quality is good.  The orange display seems a little out dated.  I have got use to the Intelligent Key.  I find myself reaching for the ignition im my second vehicle with no key.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would do all over again. "
infiniti,g35,2006,Hank Wake, 01/26/2006,6MT is NICE!,4,"The G35 is a great bargain compared to other sport cars.  I considered the IS350 and BMW 330. The 6 speed manual has a short throw that is fun to drive. I recommend the black interior, it looks better than the light colors. Bluetooth and Navigation are great options to consider.  Other buyer are right on regarding the exterior looks - others will admire your car."

infiniti,g35,2006,Chris C., 02/01/2006,Glad I got it!!!,4,"Had an 05 Acura TL. Traded it in for the 2006 G35. MIGHT have kept it if it were rear wheel drive. But needed something sportier. The G35 fits the bill. Almost got the 350Z, but I wanted something a little bigger with a usable back seat and a less harsh ride. I wish it had better mileage. But 300 horses gotta be fed. If you're thinking of buying one, the G35 won't disappoint. Truly a great car. I only had the car for 2 weeks.  I'll do a follow up in 6 mos and tell you if I still luv it as much."

If you are buying this car, pass on the automatic.  The car has zero snow handling ability though. We got a very light dusting the day after i picked it up, and the low profile tires on the 19 inch rims (6M, combined with the RWD, could not get me up a VERY slight incline.  It is a BLAST to drive though - very quick and great looking."
infiniti,g35,2006,Norm in austin, 02/18/2006,Incredible and Safe,5,"I recently purchased my second G35 Sedan - a new 2006 automatic.  I didn't even look at anything else because I feel thankful to have been so well protected when I recently totaled my 2004 G35 Sedan.  After being hit broadside into the driver's door, resulting in bending the entire car, crumpling the driver's seat, bending the tunnel, etc., I walked from the accident unhurt.  The side air curtains as well as the basic design of the car totally protected me.  Had I had passengers in the rear seat, they, too, would have been well protected by the full length side air curtains.  The performance of the G35 is excellent. And the appearance inside and out is great. I am completely sold."

I bought the car and can't think of a better way to recommend it.  Driving this car is like driving a space shuttle.  It handles, it accelerates, and it makes you feel like driving.  I now look at the BMW 3 Series cars I passed over for this one and thank myself again and again for doing so.  As far as a driving experience goes for a luxury sports sedan goes, it just can;t get any better than this."

Still in break in period but can feel the engine has immense torque reserves for a V6, and do not doubt the upper end hp. rush due to the smootheness of Nissan's VQ series engine.  Handling is netural and precise with no front end ploughing or rear end losseness.  Steering a tad heavy but lighten up nicely at speeds.  With the 17' wheels & long w/base, ride is more supple and comfortable than expected.  Car is more elemental and raw in nature compared to a Lexus/Acura.  Almost like a very well build Japanese muscle car. "

One thing im surprised no one talked about is the exhaust. deep strong sound just loud enough to hear but not annoyingly loud the ride is extremely smooth no complaints other then the fuel economy

I cannot say enough about how fun it is to drive the G35.  Everytime I get in it, I get a ""rush"".  Highway driving is where it really shines.  For the price you pay, I cannot think of a car that is more fun to drive with the performance the G35 gives.  This is not a Lexus or a BMW or even a Acura TL...And I am thankful for that."

Not just any machine but one of the best coupes out there under 35k.  The power, sound, and enjoyment of driving it makes the g35 the best coupe hands down.

infiniti,g35,2006,Guru G, 07/21/2006,No comparison in price segment - BUY IT,4,"Z: Better instrument cluster but not back seat, creature comforts cost extra. Not as elegant and stylish 3-Series: Way overpriced just for the brand-name. Underpowered (in versions costing less thank 40k). IS: 4 doors. Not fun without $8k in technology options. RX-8:Amazing handling and grip. Ugly exterior. Boy-racer image (but less than that of a Mustang heh). Needs to be redlined for any form of performace which gets annoying fast. Mustang GT: did not even bother to try G35: This car simply makes me smile. I just simply feel good when i am driving it or just simply staring at its uber sexy form.

I get a new car every so often but I loves this convertible, hence I kept it so long.  I went car shopping today and drove a Lexus Es 300, Acura TL and others.  I was upside down on my car and dealer gave me the best deal.  I bought the G 35 Sedan Premium package and I love it!  What a sturdy ride and turns great while driving fast.

After searching for the past two years, I finally pulled the trigger on the G35. Not only did we score a great deal on the car, the car is everything i hoped it would be. Once you turn off the VDS, the car is a total beast. the raw power merging onto the freeway took me by surprise and I wasn't even out of 3rd yet! I've driven all of the top german makers before purchasing this car. If all of their efforts went into the power train, why is it that every other car i see on the side of the highway is of german make?

After sitting in it, I knew it was the one. It was one of the most comfortable seats I ever sat in.  The driveability of Nissan/Infiniti has always been top notch. They always provide the best driver feedback and the G35c was no different.  It is so smooth to drive, there is nothing jerky about this car.

The sunroof creaks relentlessly and the interior plastics scratch too easily!  Am still very satisfied with the cars performance though I do wish it had stronger pull. The car seems to lose steam in 4th and doesn't pull hard in 5th.  The seats are still comfortable and the stereo has held up well so far.  Bluetooth just stopped working two weeks ago!

I've had instances where I have snaked the car through curvy, mountainous roads at speeds exceeding 65 mph, and have had no issues at all. The thrust this thing can produce can be overwhelming sometimes, say how about a very noticable acceleration when crupsing at 65mph. It feels like there is some stored power in there somewhere at times when you need that extra push!  The only downside to this car is the winter weather driving. Being a rear wheel drive makes it a little rough sometimes. Also, it being a small, light car has some disadv especially with the wind."

Got the complete package with sport suspension etc.  Rides a little rough, but the roads in Ohio leave a lot to be desired.  Also, I opted for the suspension, so I can't complain. Have 8K miles on it and can't say enough.  I thought it'd develop some rattles with the tight suspension, but nothing to date.  No complaints so far. The car is fantastic to drive, looks like a million dollars, and has the ""look-at-me"" factor we all crave.  My only concern is the summer tires.  Can't drive in inclimate weather, and replacements cost over 2 grand!  I hope they last for at least 15K miles. "
infiniti,g35,2006,df0034, 08/30/2007,Outstanding,4,"I bought this car last year and have been very happy with it ever since.  It handles very very well, the exterior design is stunning and torque is out of this world.  I wished it were a little better on fuel economy but with that much power it's reasonable.  Overall, very satisfied."
infiniti,g35,2006,jcc2007, 10/10/2007,Unimpressed,3,"My G35 RWD has auto tranny, premium pkg, but not the sport pkg. The car has been quite reliable. I like the supple ride, Bose stereo and Bluetooth feature. The keyless feature is a gimmick. If you drive it like a luxury car, it performs pretty well.  However, if you want to drive it like the sports sedan as it claims to be, you may be disappointed like I am. The engine is loud and severely lacks low end torque, and the auto tranny is slow and jerky (among the worst I've experienced). Combined with slow (yet heavy) steering, soft suspension and crappy tires, the car is very unsatisfying to drive. On top of that, the gas mileage has been consistently worse than that of our mid-size SUV."
infiniti,g35,2006,rynkshermy, 03/15/2008,LOVE THIS CAR,4,"Finaly found a great car. If you are thinking of buying one of these babys you wont be unhappy:) My wife and I both love it, FUN, comfortable, and has all the bells and whistles. Other than kicking it down with a lead foot, the car gets pretty good gas mileage, sometimes that's hard to do while driving;-)"
infiniti,g35,2006,Truth, 05/16/2008,Love it,4,"I purchased my 2006 Sedan Dec. 2006 when the new models were about to be released. I got a really good deal. I came from a Honda accord so the extra power has been GREAT. The car looks great. When it first came out I know many people did not like the design of the sedan, but now it has grown into the current times and does not look dated. In fact I think it has sharper lines and looks more sporty than the current 2007/2008 Sedans. Yes not as fast and the interior is not as nice as the newer ones but it looks just as good IMO. I have a Pioneer AVIC Z2 Navigation system in the dash and i'm all set. Black on Black."
infiniti,g35,2006,Wegs G35, 05/20/2008,A Driving Need,4,"When it was time to buy a new car to replace my used Lexus GS300 I wanted the same luxury sport sedan qualities, but with the fun to drive aspect of a manual transmission.  I looked at all the available cars in this class, Lexus, BMW, Cadillac and found that the G35 had the most to offer for the best value.  And it's a kick to drive!  I decided to get the 6MT with all the sport options (ground effects, tuned suspension, spoiler etc.) and I'm very happy with the car.  We've taken 2000 mile trips and enjoy every minute.  The car looks great from every angle and has performed flawlessly over two years."
infiniti,g35,2006,Andy, 01/25/2020,'06 G35 Coupe[Sport] 6MT- Power+Beauty+Luxury,5,"I bought my '06 G35 coupe in 2014 with 62k miles in beautiful condition. It is the Sport model with 298hp & a 6-speed manual transmission. Any buyer should know that this is essentially a Nissan 350Z (Infiniti is Nissan's upscale brand) with 2 rear seats, albeit tiny ones, a sleeker, gorgeous body design, tons more comfort/ luxury features, a traditional trunk instead of the Z's hatchback and a more powerful variant of the 3.5L V6- 298hp as opposed to the 280hp powerplant of the Z's & the non-""Sport"" model/ automatic transmission G35 coupe. The G coupes come with ample leather interior, the most comfortable sport bucket seats I've ever sat in- complete with 8-way power adjustability & variable heat and lumbar functions, lots of beautiful brushed metal trim, an 11-speaker amplified Bose sound system with subwoofer, Bluetooth-equipped in-dash CD & satellite radio unit with voice control, power sliding moonroof, a really cool power-adjustable unified steering wheel/ gauge cluster that goes up & down plus telescoping of the red-stitched heated leather sport grip steering wheel, which has illuminated audio/ dash computer controls intuitively placed near your thumbs. The top-end models like mine have a [slightly outdated] DVD ROM-based navigation system that does something extremely cool: with the press of a button, a 7-inch color display rises up from inside the top center dash, an effect that still seems impressive 14 years later. Press the button again and the screen smoothly disappears back into the dash. It also tilts forward & backward, and the nav has voice guidance aiding the onscreen animated 3D map. The '06-'07 G coupes include much improved projector-type HID headlights along with some minor exterior/ interior updates [2007 was the final year model of this body style G, 2008 introduced the bigger, heavier, less streamlined- but slightly more powerful G37]. So, onto the performance! All G35 coupes are rear-wheel drive, which any proper sports car should be, and it's got a very well-balanced low-slung & stiff suspension which make the G35 Sport coupe a genuinely agile, precise and fun machine that handles the road at any speed better than any car I've owned including an E46 M3 coupe, Honda S2000, 1994 300ZX Twin-Turbo, and far superior to the 2004 G35 coupe I drove for 6 months [a non-Sport model]. And even in stock form with no engine mods, this car is very fast- the 298hp is sent to the rear wheels through a 6-speed manual transmission, and violently throws you back in the seat when launched properly from a stop. The ""RevUp"" 3.5L V6 really starts to scream and throw power at the pavement in the mid-to-high RPM's and with skillful shifting & clutching, keeping the tachometer in the 4000-6000RPM powerband up through the gears it's like a fighter jet, and 6th-to-3rd downshifts will whip it from 70-120mph in a blink. ""S"" models come with a limited-slip differential, which dramatically increases the amount of torque delivered to the rear wheels, overall performance, handling, and generally rock solid driving experience in comparison to the 2004 base model G35 coupe I'd borrowed a year or so before buying my black candy coupe '06 G35/ Sport. The factory wheels are 19"" - very big for such a low car that's approximately the size of a 2-door Honda Accord, and they look killer. The aesthetic is also enhanced by the dual polished steel exhaust pipes- they're rather large & very shiny [if you keep them clean, which literally takes 1 minute every 5 days...] mean-looking  taillights and deeply swept lines forming a menacing yet sexy, rakish, timeless shape. It has all the amenities and it's thrilling- ""fun"" is way too weak a description of the G35/S coupe driving experience. $14-17,000 will get you a super clean, near-flawless '06 or '07 Sport with low miles, clean title, everything working etc. It took a few weeks for me to find exactly
 that but also black with black leather and a MANUAL TRANSMISSION. Now 5 years later it is still nearly flawless- I did have to replace the entire manual trans & clutch last year however, but it was the fault of someone else who tried to sneak a drive in my car when I was out, but did not know how to drive stick, and yet he was determined to drive 40 miles to cross the border, into Tijuana, Mexico because dude reeeally needed more cocaine & had a date with a TJ Hooker. Point is, you should really treat yourself to one of these gorgeous bargain luxury rockets. It'll make you feel like, a cross between Batman, and John Wick

Oh almost forgot: 22/ 19mpg [highway/ city streets]

infiniti,g35,2007,Mark, 01/03/2007,Extremely Pleased with G35,4,"Bought first Infiniti after driving all comparable entry level luxury sedans.  Expected to purchase new Lexus ES350,IS350,BMW 3-series or Accura TL.  The new G35 addressed former interior design flaws with clean, upscale, functional controls.  Seats comfortable and leather and trim match any car in class. The car stands out, however, in exterior styling and performance.  It is truly a head- turner and I've actually grown tired of telling strangers what type of car it is...most believe it would cost $40- $50K.  306 hp rear-wheel drive in Journey model is responsive with a throaty sound better than competitors.  Only the BMW 3 models compare in class and are not worth the extra $5-8K.  Safe buy."

Well how about you slow it down. Thats whats you can expect when your flooring it every time your behind the wheel. Even one person that complained about everything in regards to how the car looked inside. Well then why did you buy it. The appearance didnt change after you made your purchase did it? Quality on this car is top notch, its a nissan made vehicle of course. The ride feels extremely stable in all maneuvers. Yeah the average of about 18 to 20 mpg is a bit on the low side but when your pushing out 306hp what do you expect?"
infiniti,g35,2007,Chris M., 03/14/2017,NEVER ENDING POWER!!!! 238749 Miles & Counting,4,"I'm the second owner for this G35x. I bought it with 161,000 miles on it. The first owner had just traded it in and it was about to be taken to the auction because no one wanted to buy it because of the high miles on it. I saw it online and made a deal with the dealership and got it. The Power in this motor is exceptional. The more you step on the gas the more and more power this thing outputs. The motor in this vehicle was designed to stand for the name ""Infiniti"". Since I purchased this vehicle I can tell you, it is one of the best decisions I've made. It drives like a 50k miles vehicles. I have had no issues with it. The only things I've done is oil changes, brakes, transmission fluid change, AWD system fluid change, and tires that's it, just regular maintainence. It now has 238,000 plus miles on it and I only need shock absorbers now. I plan to keep it until it finally dies, if it ever will.

infiniti,g35,2007,Floodzone, 11/10/2006,I don't miss the Audi.,4,"My 2006 Audi A4 3.2l was recently totaled. The new G35 was worth the wait. Interior and exterior quality of this car are superb and a significant improvement from the 2006 model. I was concerned that this vehicle would be a cheap ""substitute"" for the BMW or not live up to my Audi.  NOT!  In my opinion THIS car has now set the new standard, especially considering the outstanding features and cheaper price.  This car is now unmatched: Fun to drive, great power, reliability, luxurious interior, tech options, AND less expensive...  Negatives? While I personally would rank overall performance of the G35 best in the class, I would still rank steering precision 2nd to BMW. Fuel economy is so-so."
infiniti,g35,2007,Slim Spoda, 01/12/2007,Better Than Expected,4,"I went with a 6MT coupe.  The car turns lots of heads and looks more expensive than it is.  I constantly see people looking at the car and many say it looks like a Porsche.  I considered a BMW 328 or 335 coupe, but I liked this car more than the 328 and it was about $7500 less than a comparable 335.  My last two cars were BMWs, but the ones just don't impress me.  The Aero Package really changes the look of the car for the better.  The front seats are very comfortable for people who aren't overweight.  The interior has lots of nice details and storage compartments.  The car has plenty of power and handles as well as a BMW, although it's terrible in snow.  Gas mileage has been around 24 mpg."

However, the interior of the vehicle was a disappointment. For a vehicle well over 40 grand the interior should be eye catching as well. Later that day I test drove the 07 Infiniti G35x which to me handled just as well as the BMW. The exterior of the Infiniti is just as impressive as the interior. I purchased it fully loaded for just over 40k. I got it in black with beige leather which I receive compliments all the time. BMW should take a lessons from Infiniti on interior. There is no comparison between the two. The 3.5L V6 (306 hp), blows BMW(230hp) away. BMW is in my rear view mirror. "

I've now had it a year and a half, and have 150k on the odo.  No maintenance issues, but gas is a bit of an expense.  I average 19-20mpgs combined and pumping premium fuel sucks.  Comfortable on long rides, and I'm tall and have back issues.  Getting out is a little awkward b/c it sits so low.

infiniti,g35,2007,KT, 12/01/2006,A TRUE sports sedan,4,"I've  had my '07 g35 sport automatic for about 3 weeks now. I cannot believe how exciting it is to drive! From a technology and performance standpoint, there is no other car that can touch it in this class. You currently cannot even buy a BMW 3 series (at any price) that comes with as many options as this car straight from the factory. The car is definitely as fast as it looks. If you want fuel economy, look elsewhere. Hopefully you don't think scorching acceleration should offer 30 mpg. I'm getting 18 mpg in the city and around 21 mpg on the highway."

infiniti,g35,2007,Auto Enthusiast, 11/25/2006,2007 G35x - The Japanese BMW,4,This car is a great value for the money. It combines performance + technology well just like BMW.  I previously test drove the Lexus IS250 AWD and decided to go with this car because it had more rear legroom. Head to head it is a better match up with the IS350. I got it with the Premium package and Nav. I love the Compact Flash slot up front because you can use it to play your mp3s and wmas. You can also store your songs on the 9.5 GB hard drive. Very few cars out now have both these features. You don't even need CDs. The Nav can be used with voice or touch screen. You can also watch DVDs on the same screen if you hookup a video player like a Video Ipod or Zune !

infiniti,g35,2007,Charlie, 01/02/2007,Loving It!,4,"I just picked up my 2007 G35 Sport Sedan (Auto) last weekend and have been loving it since I drove it off the lot.  The other cars that I evaluated in my purchasing process were the Lexus IS350, Audi 3.2 A4, and the BMW 335.  The G holds it own with all and surpasses them in many ways, most notably price, performance, and driving experience.  Considering that each of the aforementioned models are at least 3k more in price I dont see how one could justify such a premium.  Interior and exterior styling is truly outstanding and the sport model is flat out tight.  An outstanding automobile!"
infiniti,g35,2007,James, 12/08/2006,Best in (a very competitive) Class,5,"I test drove the BMW335i, Lexus IS350, and Acura TL Type-S. Very respectable competitors with loads to offer, but... BMW shifts were rubbery, and a 10k prestige premium didnt feel justified, especially considering reliability and repair cost. Lexus 350i was elegant inside but handling spongy. TypeS was the closest competitor for me, comparably equipped for the same price. High quality 2- tone leather, carbon fiber trim. Handled well overall, but short 20 hp and FWD just falls short of RWD kick. The G35 Sport was crisp, responsive, refined inside and out. Drove both 5A w/paddles (nifty) and 6MT (nicer!). My wife smiled as she left the 5A drivers seat, I see why you like this car, wow!"
infiniti,g35,2007,Jack Russell, 11/19/2015,Premium Gas cost has become a big negative!,3,"Pro's: driver & front passenger comfort, performance, styling, technology package, engine, transmission, air conditioning have been very reliable, backup camera, excellent control on rainy wet roads.

Cons: trunk design and space, rear seat room and comfort, under sized brakes for performance capability of car, premium gas which is now a $.70 - $.90 penalty per gallon or added $15.00 cost per fill up, no USB PORTS in car, radio selection and programming is difficult, GPS upgrades unrealistically  expensive, no one at any dealer has ever been able to explain how to use the SD media chip with the hard drive, front wheel bearings have failed along with both front left and right axle joint boots, have had electrical problems with right front lighting exceeding $1,200.00.

infiniti,g35,2007,Sizarro, 12/18/2015,9 Years of Trouble-free Fun,5,"Where to start?  We bought the 2007 G35x when it first came out.  A bit of a risk for a significant G model generation change, but, it proved to be rewarding.  The 300+ hp will leave most cars gasping when you want to hit the accelerator.  The 5-spd sport stick is absolutely the sweet spot on a car this powerful (remember, the faster the track car, the LESS gears they require).  The newer 7 speeds are a gimmick.  The in-dash compact flash card (only year provided) is awesome (all of my music is on it and yes I download it all).  I am pretty tough on a car and this G35x has held up.  I do my own maintenance and it has been minimal.  Oil changes, tire rotations, and brakes is about it.  With nearly 100k miles on it, it has served me well.  So well, that I simply plan on keeping it even though I can afford a new car.  But why?  This thing drives as good as anything out there.  The only issue I have had are two:

1. This car likes to drink fuel.  Despite the 25mpg avg, I would say I get closer to 19mpg.

2. Although the tires have worn remarkably well for an AWD vehicle (still on the 2nd set), my right front wheel shows signs of inside tire cupping (and subsequent road noise).  I plan to put another set of tires on it and get the front end checked out; hopefully that takes care of that problem.

Otherwise, I love the car.  The only reason for considering a new car is for some of the new technology that is out there such as blind spot monitoring and the 360 degree vision view (the 4 cameras).  Otherwise, I'm good.  Nissan's VQ engine won Ward's Automotive Award for about 10 years straight and this engine has performed flawlessly.  I suspect I'll need to change plugs soon, but, for now, it still runs like new (10 years later).

For what it's worth, I am a Toyota man and have had Toyota trucks most of my life as well.  You can't go wrong with the Toyota/Lexus line either (although they have had some lemons like the IS250 direct port injection issue).  Infiniti/Nissan did a nice job with this car and I think the 2007 was the best year for reliability when you consider the transmission in this car (I'd want nothing more than 5 gears mated to this engine).  By the way, I drive almost exclusively in tiptronic (sport shift) mode and have not had any issues (I don't change trans fluids either; that's usually when trouble starts).
"
infiniti,g35,2007,JRE, 09/25/2016,Balance of naughty and nice,5,"Purchased used and its has been the perfect blend of reliability, performance, handling and comfort in one package. The Bose stereo and leather seating will please the senses on long hauls, however the smoothness of whacking the shifter through the gears at a rapid pace as the car builds a momentum only distinguished as a swelling sensation, is truly exhilarating. It’s not going to win any MPG awards, but the Smiles Per Gallon (SPG) will be hard to beat.

This has been the best car I have ever owned.
Fast, nimble, firm but not a teeth shaker and yet with a backseat that's sufficient for our three kids.
Sport sedan label fits this one perfectly
The only repair we've had to make was an A/C compressor that went out a few months ago.
I had my ECM flashed early on and that took care of the touchy throttle response.
I really think my '07 looked better than the later models.
Now the M50 is coming out but that pricetag will be too high for me.
The G35 was the perfect blend of performance, comfort, and value."
infiniti,g35,2007,nm_g35, 12/04/2006,Best so far,4,"Having owned BMW, Audi, and Acura over the past ten years, Infiniti has a real ringer with the G35.  The build quality is superb, the engine totally rips and is smooth as silk, the balance between comfort & performance is the best I've found, and is hands- down the best deal going in the small luxury/sports-sedan category.  There are a few irritating misses, but overall, you can't get much better than the G35."

I came across a used, 2007, with 35k miles.
All I can say is this is the best car I have ever owned...Great looks, insanely fast, built like a tank and handles like a race car.
Driving at night I feel like I'm flying a plane - the interior lighting is great.
This car is rock solid and feels like it's on rails.
I'm still getting used to all of the techno gear and will report back."
infiniti,g35,2007,KC, 11/21/2006,Excellent Car for the money...,4,"Picked up a 07 G35 X recently. I really cannot stop driving the car. It handles excellently, rides smooth, and has every technology. From Satellite radio to laser cruise. Cannot get a better car for the money. Infiniti quality is excellent. BMW just not as reliable in recent times. AWD is also available with full 300hp. Not so for BMW(yet) or lexus(ever?). If you live in a climate that can take advantage of the AWD it really makes this car a no brainer for the compact luxury sports sedans."
infiniti,g35,2007,Heypetew, 11/24/2006,No regrets at all,4,"I was debating between the G35 and the BMW 335i coupe. I test drove both and both are great cars. The BMW engine is a bit more refined and the manual shifting seemed more effortless. But the G35 Sport provides 95% of what BMW can offer and is $8000 less comparably equipped. The G35 interior is top notch. The BMW interior is more industrial looking in an 'Ikea' sorta way. I chose the G35 Sport because it is stylish, powerful, well appointed, and won't give me headaches once the warranty is over. I have no regrets purchasing this car, but wonder if I should have waited one more year for the redesigned 2008 G35 coupe....Well done Infiniti!"
infiniti,g35,2007,07newowner, 11/26/2006,G35 - fun to drive,4,"I love driving again. I was a prev. Infiniti owner. I like the reliability, quality & style that the brand carries. I wasnt that thrilled with the seats & dash on the '06 model, but the '07 is different. The 07 G35 is stylish, powerful & well proportioned. The cockpit holds you like a pilot: steering wheel is powered & telescoping; seats move back to let you out; push button start; LED screen nicely controls navigation, radio and more. The nav. shows bodies of water, airports, restaurants & gas stations.  the steering is tight & it has good shocks. The car does jump a little when stepping on the gas which kills gas mileage but it's worth it"
infiniti,g35,2007,John Williams, 01/05/2007,g35 is a well balanced rocket,4,"I traded in my 2005 g35 6mt, for a 2007 g35 sport 6mt.I was happy with my 2005 and now feel like a kid again in the 2007. I estimate the overall upgrade to be very close to the m35 level and they held tight on price.This car pulls like a demon, and the gas mileage has improved! Coconut creek infiniti dealer in Florida is the number 1 infiniti dealer in the world, they gave me 2k off msrp,and the best buying experience I have had. No other manufacturer comes close to the new g35 value."
infiniti,g35,2007,B. Chatterjee, 01/04/2007,WOW,4,"First of all, before I begin my review I have to confess that this is my first ""luxury sport"" purchase. I drove a Saturn prior to buying this car and man it was like a quantum jump onto another planet of driving. Before I purchased this vehicle, I test drove the BMW 330i and Audi A4/S4. For the price, this car just absolutely rocks. If you are a spirited driver and don't mind the 6-speed, I definitely recommend it. Infiniti has revised the interior to be much more pampering, somewhat comparable to a Lexus. I got the Sport 6MT with the premium package (major perk is that it adds the Bose Surround Sound System). Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.  "
infiniti,g35,2007,coryz, 12/13/2006,new g35,4,"overall this is the best car that i have ever owned.  it still gives me the sports car experience of my past cars but with the luxury type ride when i want it, but without being ultra luxury since i want to still have a fun driving experience. "

infiniti,g35,2007,Gwen, 11/30/2006,Awesome Car!,4,"I traded in my 2006 GS35 for the 2007 GS35 and let me tell you that so far it is worth every penny.  There are significant differences when comparing the two.  First and foremost, the power.  The engine is powerful and smooth.  You don't hear as bumps in the road as in the 2006.  You have to watch the speedometer because getting up to 100 is easy.  The interior quality definitely has improved significantly as well.  If you want a fun car and reliable car to drive, this is it.  Only regret is that I didn't hold off long enough to get this car first.  "
infiniti,g35,2007,Horace Becknell, 09/07/2007,Dream Machine,4,"I did tons of research on competing cars from BMW, Lexus, etc.  None matched the G35 for looks, reliability, and quality for the price.  The car is a blast to drive and very comfortable on long trips.  Edmunds Consumers' and Editors' favorite coupe says it all.  Granted, gas mileage suffers, but the power of the engine is stunning - when you punch it, hang on, and I mean, hang on tight.  One more thing - it gets lots of attention. Want to get noticed? Buy this car!"
infiniti,g35,2007,Dustinson, 08/27/2009,"Buy, buy, buy",5,"I've researched a lot of cars and found this to be the best bang for my buck.  It is a true sports car, yet a gentleman's car as well.  Highway driving is very comfortable.  It handles extremely well in autoCross races also, easily beating cars such as the Porche Boxter.  My only regret is not buying sooner."
infiniti,g35,2007,Chris from Toronto, 07/11/2010,Awesome Car,4,"This is a comfortable, powerful sedan. It is great in all driving conditions. Unbelievable Bose stereo system with super base response. Great exhaust note. Super fun to drive. Great air conditioning system with dual zone. Great heated seats. Nice layout, comfortable seats. The entire control panel moves with the steering wheel adjustment - cool! Two negatives would be the poor mpg as already mentioned and less than stellar brake and tire life. Also the rubberized paint on the interior arm rests tends to scratch a bit. Could also use a bit more interior storage cubbyholes. Exterior paint is a bit soft. Car also requires Premium Gas so get ready to pay up for the privilege of driving this car. "
infiniti,g35,2007,ecollinsii, 11/19/2010,Still Loving My G35,4,"I've been living with my 2007 G35 Sport sedan for several years and never tire of it. It's built like a rock and it's fast, capable, and just plain fun. The shift algorithm has figured out my driving style, and now does it all by itself in DS mode.  It's the kind of car that you are happy to see every morning, and that you occasionally look back at just to enjoy how good it looks. Tires are always an issue with cars like this. I replaced the OEM Potenzas (which lasted 12000 miles) with Michelin Pilot Sport AS+ 235/45R18 fronts, 245/45R18 rears. Vastly improved ride, great handling, better wet performance and a 45000 mile tread wear warranty. I wouldn't give up this car for anything."
infiniti,g35,2007,Bruce Lieurance, 11/30/2006,Dream car,4,"I test drove BMW, Lexus and other cars before buying the G35.  For handling, feel, options, and pleasure, the G35 came out on top.  For the price with all options, the G35 came out on top.  A minor trade off is that the gas mileage is not as good as a BMW or a Lexus.  For quality of workmanship, warranty and pure pleasure to drive, I do not think that any other car can compete with the G35 for the same price. It is a true sports car disguised as a family car. It does take a while to learn how to operate the technology, but I find that to be a welcome challenge that keeps me from getting bored on long drives.  The navigation system is very user friendly and accurate. This is the ultimate car"
infiniti,g35,2007,Dr007NC, 12/06/2006,Tight,4,Was circling the M45 but didn't need all that car (no kids etc) so the BMW 335i was the first car then the G followed - the G is far better value with no sacrifice in performance under 99% of driving - and it brakes and comes off the line far better
infiniti,g35,2007,Satisfied So Far, 12/16/2006,G-35x 2007,4,"Have the car now two weeks, and I am enjoying the car very much. The G, I bought with AWD, (Base car is rear wheel drive), because of the winters in the Northeast and road conditions I felt was a necessity. The car is exceptionally fast and responsive, handles the road like a sports car (Miata) Must be the suspension and tire combo (17""). I think the redesign of the exterior really makes the car stunning in appearance. The interior, mine is black with the chrome, looks sporty yet elegant. I really like the way the dash is designed. Overall,  very pleased."
infiniti,g35,2007,ECONROY, 12/31/2006,Educated Purchase,4,"My wife and I research our cars well and this one has everything we wanted at a better price than Audi or BMW.  AWD, fast, handles great, attractive inside and out, comfortable for four, and has an excellent stereo.  The Nav package with the hard drive to upload CD's to was a big selling point.  An amp and subwoofer to make the stereo superb and this one is a keeper."
infiniti,g35,2007,rfojr, 02/25/2012,Best bang for the buck,5,"My wife had great success with an older I30 so I decided to try the G35S.
Not disappaointed at all!
The car is a blast to drive and I look forward to it everytime I climb in.
Compared this to the BMW 535 and although the BMW felt a little better when pushing towards the limits, the extra $20k was too hard to ignore.
Also compared the Acura TL but the front wheel drive was a deal killer not to mention the TL did not have the zip or handling.
The G did gobble up the OEM tires but that was thanks to my right foot.
I enjoyed every bit of it too!"
infiniti,g35,2007,nsube001, 05/08/2014,Poor interior quality,2,"This car's dashboard is cracking and the edges are warping which I can only imagine is because of the poor quality materials used to put it together. The handles and steering wheel buttons are all peeling, this is very disappointing I would have imagined a well-maintained ""luxury"" vehicle would have lasted. Would have spend my money elsewhere! Infiniti consumer affairs is a joke and offer no resolution."
infiniti,g35,2007,infinitissues, 12/20/2010,Performance over Comfort,4,"Noisy vehicle for both tires and engine versus BMW smooth competitors.
Very powerful and fast, and strong value for the money.


Big tradeoffs of comfort versus noise - also expensive to fuel based on MPG + requirement of premium fuel.


Interior build had issues, well known threads on interior door pull ""peel"" issues for finish that Infiniti dealer & corporate customer service
refused to cover during warrenty period.


Leather also wore poorly.
 Came in a fan to this vehicle, but it's all power over comfort / quality.
 

Trunk, compartments, and passenger area all feel cramped for space.


Very rough ride on sport model"
infiniti,g35,2007,Christen, 10/11/2008,Very disappointed,3,"Horrified by the poor tire wear! At 19,000 miles, my tires were completely bald.  Infiniti says they normally replace them around 12-15K! Now I am at 24K, and the front insides are torn up and need to be replaced. That's right... only 5,000 miles on the tires. Said it was the alignment. I will be looking to trade this car in within the year. I can't afford to replaces tires twice a year, especially at the price our tires are! "
infiniti,g35,2007,Kevinlotr, 12/24/2007,Red Racer,4,"Love that G!! Extras certainly pay off. If you have the means, I suggest the Infiniti cold air intake system with Stillen exhaust upgrades. Purrs like cougar! The car growls upon acceleration. The Billet grill is definitely an eye catcher and I get many double takes. All in all, a well thought out car, with smart perks, easy on the eyes interior design, auto up-down windows, quiet and roomy interior (and I'm 6 foot), smart key, great seats, smooth ride, fantastic cornering, and great acceleration and stopping power. Granted I have some extras on the vehicle which help, but the bottom line, I smoked my friend's M3. I am Infiniti. Hear me roar!"
infiniti,g35,2007,syzetetes, 01/14/2010,Fun with a Cost,4,"The G35 coupe is a very exciting drive, especially when using the tiptronic; however, the costs of maintenance are high.  Fuel efficiency is low, tire efficiency is very low requiring a new set every 13,000 - 18,000 miles due to offset wheel size, break efficiency is low - again due to the offset wheel size.  I've had my '07 for a little over a year and I've had the A/C motor replaced 3 times (Phoenix resident), the driver-side window motor replaced, the shocks replaced, and many dealer problems. I love the car overall, just a bit expensive for upkeep. I attribute most of the problems I've had to the dealership... absolute nightmare that will prevent me from buying another Infiniti."
infiniti,g35,2007,Art, 07/08/2010,Almost perfect,4,"Upgraded from an old Acura CL recently and purchased a used 07 G35 Sport 6MT. The power of the engine and RWD really make a difference. I am never going back to FWD. Although I originally was shopping for a coupe, I really like the sedan better. Performance and handling are great and still have room for the kids in the back. Lots of space and high end materials inside. Excellent Bose stereo. The nav works great too."
infiniti,g35,2007,Silky DMO, 08/11/2010,Needs one extra cog,4,"Really there isn't too much to complain about this vehicle. Absolutely bulletproof reliability. Peppy motor combined with an above class grade interior. The wood is beautiful. The gauges and LED accent lights reflect a designer's touch.  The car truly needs one more gear though which I believe Infiniti subtlety acknowledged by engaging the transmission in the 08 model. I've driven both cars and prefer the 08 for this change alone.  Aside from the mileage, which is frankly poor (I average 18mpg), and the need for an extra gear, the engine does have to rev to make you feel like you are driving a true sport sedan. Furthermore, the trunk space is limited by the CD changer. In sum, super car. "
infiniti,g35,2007,chiro2445, 08/18/2012,Awesome driving experience!,4,"First off I must say I came up from a 1999 Pontiac Grand AM to this amazing 2007 G35 S.
Simply put, the car is fast!
The responsiveness of this vehicle is amazing.
The active steer assist makes maneuvering at high speeds much easier although it can be a tad bit artificial.
Steering at lower speeds give great feedback and feel.
The sport package make ride comfort a bit hard and tight, but it's way better than a 99 Pontiac Grand AM lol!
The exterior styling is sleek and smooth, plus the Bose sound system is crystal clear.
I average 22 mpg on a daily basis and I'm driving about 55-60 mph average!
Overall you get performance, luxury, and value!"
infiniti,g35,2007,lighthouse206, 11/20/2006,Vroom!,5,"Had the car less than a week, but so far so good. Has amazing V-8 type power - nothing short of a rocket ship!  Everything about the car is beautiful from the curvy lines (yes, you can really tell the difference between the 06 and 07 WHEN they are near each other - the 07 is far more elegant) to the luxurious interior. Infiniti has a car that performs like a BMW yet is as luxurious as a Lexus - all for $5 - $10K less than those guys. It's an incredible value. "
infiniti,g35,2007,Steve, 12/21/2006,Great Performance,4,"We just bought the car 5 days ago.  The power is intoxicating to say the least!  Brakes are great.  The interior is so much nicer than the 2006 model.  The seats have good side bolsters for those spirited backroad jaunts.  The fuel mileage is pretty poor at 18 mph average so far.  Hopefully it goes up a few more points after break-in period.  The ride is similar to the BMW 325is coupe I had a few years back, sporty but not too bumpy.  Haven't driven in the snow yet, but I assume the all-wheel drive and the narrower 17 inch tires should be ok.  Once the snow is gone, this car will get a set of 18 inch sport wheels and tires.  I think the Boxster will stay in the garage until spring!"
infiniti,g35,2007,JGG35, 12/26/2006,First infiniti,4,"Excellent car! I have owned Toyotas and VWs previously. The car will put that 'GRIN"" on your face every drive. Engine goes like stink and car handles all too good for this price. Being 6'3 and 265 I am comfortable always. Looked at the new 3 Series first, smaller interior space and less HP. Mild winter so far here in upstate NY, anxiously waiting to test AWD. When will this ""GRIN"" go away? Sound system also plays all music types with excellent quality. Tough decision between engine sound or music! GRIN "
infiniti,g35,2007,the_hog, 01/23/2007,The hottest thing with 4 doors,4,"I test drove both the BMW 328xi coupe and sedan, neither had anything on the G35x. The power is the first major difference (outside of the price tag). The handling is just a great, while the technology amenities are even better! I live in Minnesota and the AWD makes it the perfect year round sports sedan. Simply a great marriage of performance and comfort."
infiniti,g35,2007,Watch Out, 04/01/2008,Watch Out,3,"Don't believe all the hype folks. I admit that I was also fooled by the sticker in the window. 19/25 MPG. Never happened!!! It gets more like 14/17 MPG.  Had to return it on numerous occasions concerning the transmission slipping, and the car trying to over heating on me, excessive water in the head lamps. I have to take it back today for more work.  Great price for all you get but it's not worth the headaches in the long run."

There's a strange rattling wind noise that is coming from the rear passenger side when driving >60 mph.  Anyone else hear it while the radio is off?  The technicians said it was the weather stripping but they have not been able to fix it as of yet.  There's a low pitched whistling sound coming from the front passenger side driving at >90 mph.  BTW for you owners, I use an SD Card Adapter for the Compact Flash port.  You can get one on E-Bay.  It's practically the only way I listen to music in the car now."

In any case, I couldn't be more pleased with this car.  Rapid, smooth acceleration throughout the power curve, responsive suspension, really, really a blast to drive.  I spent the whole first day with a big grin on my face. Interior and exterior, the styling is just first rate.  I went with the black leather interior which against the aluminum trim is beautiful.  Mileage for me the first couple of tanks is around 16 mpg, but I'm driving it fairly hard.  The acceleration pop of this sedan is remarkable.  "

I had to wait for mine to come in for 2 months and for the past 45 days the dealership gave me a 06 G35 to drive -- I did not like it much but when I picked up my new G35 (prem,nav,tires) I was blown away.  It is a beautiful car with tons of power and luxury.  I got black on black and it looks awesome.  Although I have always loved the BMW I just see way too many on the road and the design looks stale to me.  Good job infiniti - you have made a huge leap and I bet will sell a ton of the these cars!"

infiniti,g35,2007,Edward, 12/02/2006,The New Ultimate Driving Machine,4,"Move over BMW 3 series.  There is a new winner in that segment that costs thousands less.  I drove both the BMW 335 and 328 sedans, Audi A4, Acura TL, Lexus IS (both models) and none compared to the new G35 sedan.  Although BMW's steering was more precise and Infiniti has not mastered 0 body roll when making sharp turns, the G35 kills the BMW 3 series and its competitors in every other segment, and again, it's much cheaper.  It offers more horsepower then the BMW and the interior is not cheesy looking at all as it is on the BMW.  It offers quality and reliability as does Acura and Lexus but still has a sporty feel to it unlike Lexus.  Summary: Move over BMW 3 series, there is a new winner!!!"
infiniti,g35,2007,Rivet, 01/13/2007,new G35 coupe,5,"Great handling, more than adequate power, and one of the most appealing styles out there. This one was purchased with every option except the overpriced navigation system.  Not a single rattle, which is impressive here in western Pennsylvania."

Watch out for the MPG. Averaging 20, doing good to get 22 on the highway. The G needs a 6th or 7th gear. 3000+ RPM at 70-75 mph on the highway is poor engineering. "

For the money it can't be beat.  However, it's a little rough around the edges. The throttle hangs when you release it and then the RPM's drop suddenly, limiting responsiveness.  Engine vibrates noticeably at higher RPM. Sunroof seems to create some wind noise at >70 MPH."

That is until i came across the 07 G35x. The interior is fantastic, matched by it's exterior appeal. The engine is smooth and powerful, and the Nissan 3.5 is backed by award winning quality. Tried and true, mechanically these cars are bullet proof. The AWD keeps you where you're going, and 0-60 in 5.2 is no joke.

The bad:  6 days after taking delivery discovered a paint flaw in three doors (looks like someone ran their fingers under the clear coat and left a ""wax residue"" the size of a hand).  Manufacturer acknowledges it was a factory defect but is only willing to re-paint all doors, plus part of the front and rear quarter will need to be repainted. BBB says I have no case under Lemon Laws.  The car is silver which is a difficult color to match. The manufacturer may be following the law by only offering to re-paint but is it really fair to force a client to accept a repainted new car?  In my opinion no."

infiniti,g35,2007,dcowboys, 06/04/2007,never an infinti again,2,"I was previously a Lexus owner for the past 7 years.  Decided to go with the sleek body of an Infiniti G35.  Within two months, began experiencing ignition problems - would sputter and die on cold starts.  Dealer worked on it for two weeks before it replaced ECM.  Problems are back a month later. Infiniti refuses to replace vehicle.  "
infiniti,g35,2007,Chris, 08/13/2007,Makes me do bad things,4,"I got a G35 coupe in July with the special financing before the G37s were coming out.  The BMW 335i is probably better, but its 15k more.  Doesn't quite have the power I'd like at low RPMs that I'd like, but at high RPMs it does great.  I find myself making excuses to push this car and drive in a manner some would consider inappropriate.  The sports suspension is a tiny bit stiff, but in all, it's a great car."
infiniti,g35,2007,ecollinsii, 10/20/2007,Category Killer,4,"I was intrigued when my local Infiniti service staff started to buzz about the 2007 G35 sedan. I needed more sport in my life after several years in an I35. I got it. This car is a category killer. I bought the G35 Sport w/5 speed auto and most techo options. It's blistering fast, has great handling (stable at any speed and extremely nimble), and has top class braking. It's very tractable around town in D - shift the manumatic for yourself, and it's show time. The nav system is top notch and the 10Gb music hard drive stores 500 CDs. Unlike some I like its looks just fine. Very modern in the Japanese idiom. Downs: stiff ""sport"" seats, poor mileage. But for $40K you can't do better than this."
infiniti,g35,2007,Car Addiction, 02/21/2020,"Go out and get one! Love this car, so fun!!!",4,"I’ve owned more cars than I can count. Truly. Bought this 2007 in 2019. It was cheap & had 170,000 miles. Clean Carfax, meticulously maintained. I can’t believe how much I love it. Owned a Lexus RX & Audi convertible at the time. Clearly more reliable than the Audi, more power than the Lexus. Perfect in every way expectation for interior finish. Nissan/ Infiniti are known for not having as good interior materials as Lexus. The interior door handle, all of the finish is worn off. Here’s where I think Nissan/Infiniti win, cold, cold A/C! I’ve had numerous Toyota/Lexus products and Nissan/Infiniti wins hands down in this category. You’ll hear it time & again, people who like Mercedes May prefer Lexus. BMW lovers prefer Infiniti. Fast, agile, responsive. Fun to drive. I live in an area where the on-ramps to the freeway are quite short and there are lots of semi’s. This car screams onto the freeway from ramp, wow it’s fast! I probably would not give this car to my teenage sons, it’s a rocket! Other than interior handles it’s a gem. It’s a keeper. Mine is black and I have those classic black California license plates, a stunning combination! Used, these cars are the deal of the century. I’d buy another. Will likely buy the FX35 after this!

Would do it again."

infiniti,g35,2007,og, 12/08/2006,"Very good car, but it has its quirks",4,"Overall, this is an excellent car, but you have to accept certain Saab-ish or Subaru-ish quirks that come with it. Can not complain about the shift linkage, handling, acceleration, or comfort. The quirks I mentioned include things like memory seats.  Yes, the seat will move to the predetermined position, as will the steering wheel, but the side view mirrors will remain still.  Also, here are RCA jacks for an MP3 player in the center arm rest compartment, but there is no integrated charger or mount for the iPod.  The car also does not have daytime running lights.  Overall, these are small gripes and the money saved over a MB, Audi, or BMW is well worth the minor inconveniences.  "

infiniti,g35,2007,Silas, 06/10/2009,"Beautiful car, but expensive to maintain",3,"This is a beautiful and powerful (306 horsepower) car.  However, it is a sport edition which means different sized tires.  This is a nightmare.  Not only are the tires expensive, but I am on my third (yes, I said third set) and I only have 40K on the car.  Also, the gas mileage is horrible.  It averages about 14-16mpg.  Terrible!"
infiniti,g35,2007,Jeff, 12/28/2006,"Wonderful car, great value!",5,"I've owned my new G for 1 month (my family also has a '97 Maxima (102k mi) and '95 240SX (170k mi)). The new G has classy (mature but not boring) styling, a quality interior (with good rear legroom), gobs of power, a great exhaust note, and it corners like it's on rails. Plus, the Studio on Wheels, easy-to-use dashboard controller, and the quality leather are noteworthy. The auto in Sport mode is amazing!  Fit and finish are excellent and everything about the car has a solid feel. I highly recommend it.  I had also checked out the 3-series (poor rear legroom, mediocre styling, expensive), Lexus IS (SMALL interior, unappealing styling). The wrong-wheel drive TL was not in the running."
infiniti,g35,2007,george, 10/09/2008,Not too good in the rain,4,"Just having sold my G35 sport finds me missing this car, not at all. I truly believed this was a fantastic built and designed sports sedan. Having downscaled due to $ concerns, I don't really miss it especially when it rains, for (2) reasons. The HP is enormous and fast acceleration on a rain slick surface spins you out and secondly, after you park in your garage, notice all the water falling from the wheel well and gathering around each wheel. If you have a flat surfaced garage, expect to mop up 8 towels worth of water off the floor. Apparently, the trim panels collect the road splash and slow drip when parked. Add to that a look-alike Nissan styling for $10k less."
infiniti,g35,2007,Melinda Palmer, 05/18/2009,Beware of tires,3,"I have 26,000 miles on my G35 and need to put the third set of tires on the rear.  I have been told that because of the difference in the tire size (front & rear) that rear tires seldom last for more than 10,000 - 12,000 miles.  Wish someone had told me this prior to purchasing!  Definitely will NOT purchase another G35."
infiniti,g35,2007,Joel Adler, 07/27/2009,Second Time is even better,4,"This is my second G35X.  I loved the first (2004).  This car has been even better.  I am actually getting better mileage as well.  The original Goodyear tires were poor, but a step up from the previous car's horrible original tires.  I replaced them with Hankook tires after 29000 miles. No complaints there. I am still on my original brake pads after 41000 miles.  I can't believe it, but I have them checked, and they are fine.  It might be due to my use of the autostick . This car is a lease, but I will likely purchase it at the end of the lease.  I drove the 2009 with the 7 speed auto and 328 horsepower.  There was no real difference. The Bose premium ""studio on wheels"" sounds great."
infiniti,g35,2007,MissMyIntrepid, 02/19/2008,Lots of room to improve,3,"Infiniti falls short in so many areas. The controls are a foot away from the display for what you're changing (A/C, stereo), the A/C controls are non-intuitive. Bumper paint doesn't match. Dash lights don't match. Body and trim panels vary in fit. Front sport seats are too tight for an average (180 lb) adult. Bad clutch - in for recall today. Cheap floor mats are almost worn out! 14 bolts/plastic cover to replace oil filter and change oil. Front chrome grill easy to chip. Moon roof trim falls out. Redundant service disply in console and in dash. Cheap analog clock should be digital for quick read. Leather not as soft as previous year. Little storage in cabin. Stereo FM separation very poor."
infiniti,g35,2007,G35 Dallas, 11/22/2006,G35 at BMW's Heels,4,"Not as refined of an engine/transmission nor as surgical in handling as a BMW 3 Series, but the new G35 sedan is the only Japanese sport sedan that comes pretty darn close.  The sport level edges the gap even closer, which gives you rear wheel assisted turning.  With superior integration of technology and a much improved interior from its predecessor it is difficult to find fault in this car.  In comparison, the IS350 has a stuffier interior and a softer ride, much less sportier.  The BMW 3 Series is much pricier and has questionable long term reliability.  This car is the perfect median when it comes to Japanese value and reliability vs German performance and refinement."
infiniti,g35,2007,MLS, 03/30/2007,"Good Power, Bad MPG",4,"I love the G35x w/ the 306HP it's great, however the MPG hasn't been over 20 MPG since I got it.  Infiniti advertised 19/26 it's more like 13/18 and that's not good."

Looked at the 2007 Audi A4 3.2 but also stopped at Infiniti to check out the new G35 because I liked the new body style. As soon as I got behind the wheel. It was a no brainer. More power than the Audi and a plusher interior. Couldn't wait until my lease on the Audi was over, so worked out a great deal to get into the G35x. Opted for the Premium package and so far so good.

infiniti,g35,2007,blkG, 08/02/2008,Finicky G35,4,"Have had G since 10/07, a lot of little problems and some not so little.  Speaker makes a ""pop"" noise when car engine turned on from battery on position; sunroof wouldn't stay closed, needed to have motor replaced; one of my windows wound not roll up via ""one touch"".  Now the throttle when first started in the morning sounds as if car is going to die out.  Apparently Infiniti has no fix for this yet, but there's a bulletin out on it.  I also have performance tires & they're wearing out way to quick. Great looking & performing car but come close to warranty - trade in likely considered."
infiniti,g35,2007,Michael, 08/20/2008,Over a year and LOVE my G35S,4,"I have had my G35S for over a year now and I can honestly say that I still love this car.  Great brakes, great performance, great style, great radio, just an all around great car!!!  My only complaint is the gas mileage, it is not good at all. I know this car is a performance car, but I never expected 16 mpg or less for highway/local road travel."

The handling is superb, the exterior of the lines gives it that sexy look, the interior is purely impressive.  I have three complaints, the trunk is pretty small, I'm the only driver but when traveling one large suitcase and duffel bag and your packed. Gas mileage is definitely not impressive and I think it should have at least been an option to have integrated driving lights in the bottom grille. Other than those three I would buy this car all over again!"
infiniti,g35,2007,Jim, 09/02/2008,Very enjoyable,4,"Coming up on first year anniversary. Have had none, zero, zip problems with this wonderful car. Which, to me, is pretty amazing. The voice-activated navigation system is terrific, though this is my first exposure to a navigation system, so I have nothing to compare it against. Early in my ownership (first 60days) I had occasion to use the four wheel drive during an ice/sleet/snow storm. It was a little nerve-wracking because I had just shelled out for the car and I would have rather been in my 14 year old suv but it handled as advertised and I was sold. Also, when you want to blow past traffic, the 306 hp (which I've never had before) is impressive."
infiniti,g35,2007,micah herron, 11/16/2008,One Year Review,4,"I have been very pleased with the reliability and performance of the car. I have had zero problems with the vehicle and have not had to return to the dealer for any issues (have performed all the maintenance myself). Acceleration and braking are all excellent. The sport suspension and tires provide excellent handling without compromising comfort too much. Interior is very quiet at speed, The exhaust note is good without being too loud. Stereo has good clarity and volume although not tremendous base. I have never averaged under 20 mpg in everyday driving and have gotten 27 mpg on all interstate driving. The trunk is smallish and the interior does not have a lot of storage. Tires wear quickly."
infiniti,g35,2007,GMANWC, 11/21/2008,31K & Counting,4,This is one fun car to drive! Purchased 3/07 and we're now up to 31K miles. Sport tires lasted til 27.5K. Could have been better but they are sticky suckers. I buy cars looking at engine performance 1st and value for the buck 2nd. I don't think I could have done better. This engine has the power to make me smile ear to ear everyday. I love blowing by other cars and looking in the mirror. Only guy that had the engine to stay with me was in an Audi S4. Handling is great. Interior is excellent. Nav useful. Sound system makes my guts thump. The kids and the wife like it too but have to be good when they're in the car.
infiniti,g35,2007,John, 01/06/2009,Great Car,4,"Drove Saabs for 20+ years and the G35 is significantly better in all respects.  Haven't had it back to dealer for anything but scheduled maintenance in 1-1/2 years - 30,000 miles.  Can easily drive 750+ miles per day without getting tired.  Best quality new car I've owned in 45+ years of new car ownership."
infiniti,g35,2007,james, 02/10/2009,Bang for the buck,4,"This car is beautiful to look at but not beautiful to drive!  Overall it is a fun car with very high performance limits.  However it has a slightly unsophisticated feel to it - in the clutch and suspension feel and the acceleration is not linear.  The brakes are awesome.  The rear axle tends to hop with wheel spin which is a letdown.  If you don't spin the tires acceleration is top notch.  Anything above 8/10s level the car feels flawless.  It is in normal day to day driving, particularly the daily work slog, that it can be tedious to drive.  Again, for the money this car in pretty much in it's own league.  Just be prepared for a rough around the edges experience."
infiniti,g35,2007,Okita, 03/14/2009,Great car.,4,This is an excellent car. The brakes are good and matches the power that the car produces. It would be even better if the car could lose about 200lbs.

infiniti,g35,2007,Phoenix, 05/23/2009,Great car,4,"This car is very fast and it looks great in black.  The sports seats are very tight.  I'm waist size 32.  This car can be much more efficient if the top gear is much taller.  Unless you're living in a very hilly city, there is no reason to have the RPM above 3K at 70 mph.  It feels very wasteful, and it is very wasteful.  Another major problem are the tires.  The front tires start to feather out and make a lot of noise at around 10K.  I had to replace them even though they still have a lot of tread.  "
infiniti,g35,2007,khr, 06/21/2009,Very Satisfied,4,"Infiniti did it again with a great car!  I love driving this car, it handles great and I highly recommend it!  I sold a 2002 BMW 325i to get this car and am glad I did!"

Cars slipping all over.  Not enough time to plow the roads yet.   The G35x was AWESOME.  Even with wider tires, the g35x's awd and the stability control literally disconnected me from the snowy road.  I have a 2000 subaru, and the AWD on that is great.  But this car would have blown it away.   The G35x is an incredibly competent vehicle.  Hands down.  It will cruise in great luxury, and will blast ahead of traffic when needed.   For sure there are cars that will beat every individual aspect of this car, but as a package, it is impressive as all get out!"

If you get this car fully loaded with the Tech pkg and it's the perfect blend of them all. I am beyond happy with this car. Gas mileage is a drawback but it has a long list of positive trade offs. Manual Clutch takes some getting used to but is extreme fun once you master it. "

infiniti,g35,2007,geffen, 12/06/2009,An excellent car,4,"Wonderful car to drive.  The throttle is twitchy until you get used to it which takes about a week.  It's sort of funny watching someone drive it who is not used to it.  Everyone's head bounces off the headrests (which are well padded).  I understand they modified the throttle response in the later models which is unfortunate.  The car has performed flawlessly but be prepared to replace the brake pads every 15,000 miles and the rotors will need to be machined each time. $$$$"

Yes it took me about a week of getting whiplash to adjust to the acceleration. Powerful car, handles well in all types of weather, I have the AWD X version and it went thru the snow better than my 4WD did. Sound system is incredible. Superb breaking and cornering. When U want speed it rocks, when you're cruising it's very smooth."
infiniti,g35,2007,Impressed...., 01/01/2010,Impressed.....,4,"I bought the car from Carmax with 12000 miles.  Needless to say, I have been impressed.  It is fast and handles great.  The navigation is the best around and the technology package is outstanding and the backup camera is a nice feature (so my wife says).  Gas mileage is about 20 avg, with mixed highway/city driving.  The only complaint is the back seat is a little cramped for my oldest daughter, but she manages.  Infinity puts Bridgestone Potenza from the factory and they stink.  I barely got 20K miles.  The staggered set up is new to me, but this a sports/performance car.  I highly recommend this car to anyone.  It is my wife's daily driver and highly reliable and safe!!!"
infiniti,g35,2007,AQua, 04/12/2010,Best car for the money,4,"You can't turn down a car that will put out 300+ HP, be as smooth as this one, accelerate like this one does, or look like this one does all under 40k. You just can't go wrong with this car. The gas mileage stinks, but gas mileage on most cars this fast is not very good. I drive this car pretty hard and I get about 18 mpg. If you drive it normally, you'll get more. I have about 25k on the car and just about now will need tires and brakes, so I'm not sure about past reviewers saying they've had to do it with so much less mileage. The and exterior and interior styling of this car are exceptional!  The Bose System is phenomenal!  I would recommend this car to anyone who can afford a sports car!"
infiniti,g35,2007,InfinitiPhanatic, 05/20/2010,Awesome Bang for Buck,4,"I love this car after driving the G35x sedan (model is AWD). With 309 HP generated from a 3.5 ltr V6, it has plenty of pickup and handling. Acceleration is smooth and powerful when you need it. Steering feels tight without feeling heavy. It's a very easy car to drive. Outside, it's got a very sporty look. Clean lines make this a very attractive car. Inside its all luxury considering the price. The car looks expensive, but compared to its competitors, it's a real bargain. I highly suggest a look if you are in the market for a sports sedan (oh and by the way, it's been named top sports sedan 4 years in a row by a national rating agency). Very pleased with it (this is my second Infiniti). "

infiniti,g35,2007,CarBuff, 05/26/2010,Enjoy it but hate the brakes,4,"G35x fully loaded w/ 22.5k miles. Overall I'm very happy with my 07 G35x.  However after 7k miles and again at 12k miles the rotors warped and had to be resurfaced.  At 21k rear brakes were replaced.  This is unacceptable for a car that has such low miles.  Also the sunroof had to be completely replaced after it froze-up for no reason.  The service experience has been average, greasy finger prints on headliner after being returned from sunroof install, broken license plate frame and other annoyances.  On the up side the G is fun to drive and I like all bells and whistles.   Can't complain about the pricing either.  All that said, I would buy another Infiniti."

The Sport model suspension is firm without being harsh, and the paddle shifters for the 5AT are excellent. Inside all of the amenities are within easy reach, and the layout (especially the gauges) is outstanding.  Sport seats are comfortable, and hold you snugly through any maneuver :-)  The trunk space is pretty limited, and the rear seats don't fold down :-(, so there's room for even large suitcases, but not wide items.  Fuel economy is pretty dismal, but to be fair I drive it in manual shift mode all the time, and rarely shift up to 5th except on the highway.  Great car, great price, I'm delighted."

infiniti,g35,2007,James, 01/27/2007,Very Nice,4,Love it.  Comfortable and very fun to drive.  The 306 HP really makes this car move.  Nav package is a must.
infiniti,g35,2007,markt_99, 01/30/2007,Totally Awsome,4,"This is a G35 S 6MT with the premium package.  The performance is awesome.  I've driven Volvo S60R, BMW 330i, Audi A4(3.0 and 2.0 T) and this is the most impressive engine.  Best selling point was when salesmen let me test drive alone and left traction control off by accident.  Car almost went sideways on dry pavement shifting to second with an automatic.  Was concerned about its traction control until I found out traction control was off.  I later drove a manual with it on.  I can say this is the fastest car I've ever driven and blows BMW and Audi away unless you pay the extra 30-40K for Audi S-4, RS-4, or BMW M3. Premium is worth it for the awesome bose studio on wheels and the bluetooth"
infiniti,g35,2007,Nice Car!, 01/29/2007,Worth Every Penny!,4,"The new G35 is solid ride and very well built.  I'm replacing a 2005 Acura TL which was a rattling piece of junk.  There is a world of difference and not for much more money.  The style exterior and interior is great much better than the previous G35.  It's very, very fast and fun to drive.  If you want one of these cars, get at least the premium and tech packages and the wood package is neat also.  The seats are stiff and fairly average size - not made for a large person!  It's simply a great value for the money and hopefully be great quality and a great alternative to Acura who I feel is slipping in quality.  "
infiniti,g35,2007,Bill Anderson, 02/08/2007,The BMW Killer,5,A real fun car to drive.  In snow it feels like it's glued to the road. The interior design just feels comfortable and controls are well placed.
infiniti,g35,2007,Paul, 02/12/2007,Car of our dreams,4,"Sold our wonderful 2003 G35 sedan to buy our great new 2007.  This is our four door sports car that puts the fun in our driving every time we use it. We have the luxury package, navigation package and tech package on her and are thrilled with all the features. Have found no defects in the first three months of ownership.  Buy one and you will love her."
infiniti,g35,2007,Hank Henry, 02/08/2007,Last sports car for a 67 year old.,4,"Dollar for dollar, best buy out there. A real pleasure to drive if you enjoy a vehicle that will perform like a true sports car while providing the space for up to five occupants.  "
infiniti,g35,2007,FAA, 02/16/2007,Glad I made it to an Infiniti,4,"I owned a 2002 Passat & wanted to upgrade by buying a new car. Drove several cars like the Lexis IS 250, Acura TL, BMW 325 and others. Then I took out the Infiniti 35X & bought it. It's been almost a month and I can tell you that it's a great car. It has a lot of power, luxury and beauty. The only negative I can think of is that the fuel economy is OK - not great. But, everything else about the car is really ideal. Before buying any other luxury car take the G35X for a ride, I think that you will decide what I decided and buy it. Good luck."
infiniti,g35,2007,gramps hotrod, 02/19/2007,Good Value,4,The looks are better than almost any car on the road. The price compared to the competition makes this car a real bargain.
infiniti,g35,2007,BigEasyRider, 02/17/2007,Excellent!!!,4,"I've had this car for 2 weeks now and I'm ecstatic over it's head-turning styling and jaw-dropping power. This G35 is the very best in this price range and is far superior, in my opinion, to the BMW 3 series and the Lexus I350. And at a much lower price too! Great, solid feel to the entire machine."
infiniti,g35,2007,newgs, 02/18/2007,infiniti g35 journey,5,"This G has real power and you can feel it on all levels.  Gives you that great sound of the engine too without being annoying. Coming off a BMW 330; the G is just as good in terms of performance at a much lower cost. Also gets a lot of attention because of its awesome looks/exterior design. Nice space inside and not tight at all in the back seats, unlike others in the segment."
infiniti,g35,2007,Auto Enthusiast, 02/20/2007,"Well Balanced - Fast, Dependable & Sexy",5,The G35 does everything well. And it's design is subtle - not overstated like many others in its category. Test drive one and you'll agree. Well made. Fun to drive. Good looks.
infiniti,g35,2007,rwporto, 02/21/2007,Wow!!! What a car!!,4,"Just picked up my '07 G35 Sport 5AT this weekend.  What an AMAZING car!!! I have three young children, and they all fit extremely comfortably in the back seat, unlike my prior Volvo S60.  Word of warning...this car teases your right foot.  Get it on the highway and it wants to go.  Have to admit...I give in to the tease :)  Highly recommend this car. Great price, beautiful styling, upscale and spacious interior."
infiniti,g35,2007,Kring5, 02/22/2007,Jaw Droping... WoW... Amazing!!,5,"This car is absolutely fantastic. it's fit and Finish are stellar, the 4 wheel active steer is amazing and if your ordering a car, don't skip this option!  The handling is stellar, the power of this car is actually dangerous for most people.. I wish it had a way to cut the power in 1/2 for valets and the wife :)  If you're looking for the king of performance it's either the G35S or the BMW 335i for ($11K more) but I don't see $11K in extra value out of the 335i. The TL is not in the same performance league and the IS350 falls quite short on handling and driver feedback."
infiniti,g35,2007,Sizarro, 02/25/2007,Look No Further!,4,"Bought the G35 AWD with Premium Pkg, Nav Pkg, Tech Pkg, Rosewood interior, and Splash-guards. The car is awesome. Smooth, powerful drive-train, nice trans (5-spd but that's all you need), tiptronic works great, bluetooth sync'd with no problem to a Sprint Sanyo Katana, excellent sound system, back-up camera is nice to have. Highly recommend the Rosewood interior; without it cheapens the interior.  Looked at the the Lexus: IS250, ES350 & GS350 as well as the Acura TL. Evaluating the Infiniti was almost an after-thought. But, for the money and driving experience, the 07 G35 is the standard to beat right now in this class (maybe any class).  If looking for a driving experience; look no further."
infiniti,g35,2007,wildginger, 03/02/2007,Best in Class,4,"On top 10 list for 2007 by Car & Driver and Consumer Reports for a reason.  You must test drive to believe the power, handling, and sound of engine.  Only car with hard drive for downloading whole CD collection and categorizing songs by mood.  A 21st century car, with unbelievable nav graphics, adaptive front lighting for driving around curves at night, intelligent cruise control, rear view camera with guidance for back up into parking places, blue tooth phone, XM satellite radio.  Fully loaded car is $5K less than loaded Lexus IS350 and $8-9K less than BMW.  This car jumped way ahead of Acura TL in value. Excellent reliability record makes it hard to beat."
infiniti,g35,2007,JAMES, 03/02/2007,Fun gas guzzler,3,I had this car for 3 weeks now and like the cars performance overall. I wish it had more torque like the lexus. The lexus is350 had a stronger motor and was more comfortable inside. The bmw was just an overall nicer car. I guess you get what ya pay for. The g35 also has hard seats and loves to burn fuel. I get about 15-16 mpg around town. The g35 doesn't handle as well as a bmw in high winds or at high speeds. It gets loose in the turns at high speeds. Sure hope gas prices don't climb again.
infiniti,g35,2007,JDB, 03/10/2007,G35X Black on Black,4,"After driving an 02 BMW530, looked at several 07's.  After 2 months my thoughts are these: Bad Fuel Econ. 13.5 city (my 530I got 17), 19 hwy.  Fun to drive, great handling in the snow.  Sound sys. is great, Bluetooth sync. up without any problems.  Love to drive the car - great off the line pickup. Good sized trunk for the golf clubs."
infiniti,g35,2007,houdriver, 03/08/2007,Infiniti G - Fun to Drive,4,"I think the Infiniti G is a great value play considering the performance and initial quality. More than anything, new Infiniti buyers will enjoy a very entertaining driving experience. This is a fast car that holds the road nicely. I spent a lot of time driving a Journey with 17 inch wheels prior to purchase, but decided to add the performance tire and wheel package. I think the car has a more refined and quieter ride at highway speeds on the 18 inch Bridgestone tires. The drawback is that the 18"" tires can not be rotated like the 17's."
infiniti,g35,2007,frank, 03/05/2007,Infinity top dog,4,This car is a gas to drive. Its a high tech muscle car with great looks. The bose sounds great and the car handles and stops better than the lexus and cost less. Infinity really out did themselves this time. How do they do it? 
infiniti,g35,2007,zugisland, 03/12/2007,Wow,4,Unbelievable value and performance..just bought my g35x and all my friends and family thought i paid well over 50 k for this car...

infiniti,g35,2007,bobz G, 03/07/2007,G35 Sedan Loaded,4,"I bought a black G35 sedan from Infiniti of Chantilly.  Got the works.  Although the stereo isn't digital surround, it still was the best in class. great tech features, good bass, hard drive to store all your cd's.  The car gets fast, quick.  Feels like 40 when you're doing 70.  Bought the active steer, suspn.'s a little stiffer, but it handles great.  Nav is decent, back up cam had better features than others'.  Still haven't used the Intell. Cruise Control, but it's too much fun to drive.  Was initially leaning towards a Type-S, but the feel of RWD and the Studio on Wheels sealed the deal.  "
infiniti,g35,2007,Tom In VA, 03/08/2007,Great Car,4,"The car is a lot of fun to drive. Hit the gas and the car moves. I love the sound of the engine as the RMPs climb. The technology is integrated very well. I have all the packages and it is going to take awhile to get up to speed on all the car's capabilities. The road feel is excellent, much better than the comparable Lexus. The back seat area could use more room but my teenage boys love riding in the car so much they don't mind the lack of foot space. This car replaced by Audi A6 and is much more fun to drive. I liked the all wheel drive of the Audi so much I go it on the G35 as well. Need to wait for some snow to see how it does."
infiniti,g35,2007,Dave, 03/26/2007,Unbelievable!,4,"That says it all. I have owned this car a week.This car turns heads, more than my BMW528i, then snaps their necks as they watch it disappear. Unbelievably fast, it will challenge you to keep up with it. I bought mine loaded with Tech, Nav and Premium with Rosewood Trim. Love the stereo, Nav, Voice Rec. This car is a true pleasure to drive.  I am always looking for excuses to go for a drive. Test drove the Acura TL- S, the BMW330i. The Infinity hands down outperforms them and doesn't look like everyone else on the road. "
infiniti,g35,2007,Keith, 03/26/2007,Great Car,4,I really like this car. A lot comparisons to BMW but I see way too many 3 series.  I really enjoy driving the car.
infiniti,g35,2007,JR, 04/06/2007,Great Car,4,I just purchased this car. Its a rocket. Well laid out interior. I test drove everything in its class and for the money it is the best deal. Fell in love with it during the test drive and purchased it the same day.
infiniti,g35,2007,DAISY, 04/06/2007,Happy Owner,4,"I love my car. Test drove BMW 330i, VW Passat, Acura TL, Subaru Outback, Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima. I made my mind up after only one visit and one test drive.  Love the looks car inside and out. Drives great and many fun features. I have over 1500 miles and I can find a few suggested improvements, but even with those I would not trade it for another car."
infiniti,g35,2007,efeezy, 04/08/2007,Be$t Bang for the Buck,4,"Straight up performance w/luxury and technology! Some may not be ready for the new G35 sedan. Only the few owners of this car can relate. A heavy foot can get you in trouble if you're not careful. It will unleash a plethora of power and unlike the rest of the class. Infiniti comes standard w/306 hp. The G35 Sport is specifically designed w/a limited-slip differential for improved traction under acceleration and larger disc brakes & redesigned calipers for better stopping power. Additional cost for luxury & convenience is very reasonable and with all the toys, it is still a lot cheaper than other cars in it's class. Also, you get the credible repuation of Infiniti's reliability & safety"
infiniti,g35,2007,008, 03/27/2007,Best Entry-Level Sedan For The Money,4,"Leased a '07 G35 Auto Journey w/sunroof & wheels/tires package. Great car for the $$. Fun, classy & just enough room for us & our 2 yr. old... Didn't want to pay for Premium package since I didn't care for fancy Bose, homelink, MP3 player, memory seats + steering & mirrors, auto-lumber support, dimming mirror or bluetooth. But wished it had heated seats, so I opted for the stand alone sunroof + wheels/tires since the G35 Sports rode a little harsh & Journey more suited for us w/the toddler. This car is very very fast (I came from a Subaru Forester XT which was a total sleeper) and wants to go all the time. Handles extremely well and interior is comfy. "
infiniti,g35,2007,Researcher, 03/23/2007,car of the year,4,"It is a no brainer. Research and test drive the Lexus, BMW, Mercedes etc.  Compare their options, price and driving experience with the Infiniti G35. BMW and Mercedes charge lots more for their cars and they have fewer features (unless you want to pay even more money to them). The BMW and Mercedes only have a single CD player and they have no hard drive record feature like the Infiniti.  Infiniti is the clear choice this year. I have driven mine for 5000 miles now and it is absolute perfection. I have driven it hard through corners and up to 145 mph.  The car handles perfectly under all conditions.  You cannot compare the other cars and the price without saying that Infiniti is the best of all"
infiniti,g35,2007,Thomas Windley, 04/01/2007,"Fantastic, But Not Perfect",4,"Overall the 07 G35 Sedan is a superb car.  Excellent power and handling and the best brakes in its class.  Technology and styling make this car practical and functional.  Sold a '03 Mercedes Benz CLK500 and the G35 outperforms it.  BMW 335i still holds the benchmark for this class but the G35 is a better value.  Cannot justify paying $10k more for a similar performing car with less room and options.  Disappointing gas mileage, no better than the V-8 Mercedes.  EPA of 19 & 26 is a laugh.  I haven't had mileage on averaage higher than 19 during the four months I've had the car.  Also had some issues with the voice controls for audio and phone.  Fantastic car but not perfect."
infiniti,g35,2007,Don, 04/11/2007,Thrill to Drive,4,"I have been researching new cars for over a year and the G35X was a last minute choice. I originally looked at Lincoln MKZ, Lexus IS250, Cadillac CTS & BMW 325. But I have to say I'm absolutely in love with this car. It moves like the wind and is a joy to drive. The only issue I have so far is getting the HomeLink system to work with my garage door opener but that's a minor problem when compared with the exceptional performance of this car!"
infiniti,g35,2007,Jason, 04/18/2007,Wants to be let loose,4,"Tons of research of the usual culprits, just couldn't justify the extra $15k for BMW cachet.  I got the Premium package. Excellent value.  Great torque and HP. Need to be light on the pedal because she really wants to run. Beautiful interior with loads of great features standard (bluetooth, sun roof, incredible sound system, etc.).  I have long airport commutes on a two lane highway - the ability to blow around slower moving vehicles is incredibly refreshing. Love the power and handling."
infiniti,g35,2007,The Doo, 04/26/2007,One of the best Japanese imports,5,"I've been driving this car for approx 3 months now and I still catch myself smiling each time I enter the car.  I was actually set on buying the 335i, but decided to test drive the '07 6mt before making a final decision.  Unlike the very industrial look of the Bimmer's interior, the G had that sense of warmness that I didn't really feel in the other cars I tested (IS 350, TL type S, A4, S4).  Besides the IS 350 and 335i, the G simply trumps its competition when it comes to delivering raw power.  I didn't think I could love the car anymore.  That is until I started modding the car.  So far... exhaust, upgraded springs/shocks, 20"" wheels... and much more to come."
infiniti,g35,2007,Roger Mussa, 04/30/2007,Too early but... WOW!!,4,"Searching for a car for over a month. Coming out of an 05 BMW 3. Considered Lexus IS, BMW 3, almost got a Volvo S60. Had a last minute change of heart and drove the G35, fell in love immediately. Best bang for your buck bar none. Standard stuff much more than you need and pay for elsewhere. Beautiful in and out. AWD nice, finish, smooth ride, comfortable."
infiniti,g35,2007,TCS, 04/04/2007,Picture Perfect!,4,"Traded in an 06 BMW 325i for the G35 Sedan Sport w/Premium, Nav, & Tech pkg. Test drove Lexus IS 250 and BMW 5 series before. My wife loved the G35 coupe for quite a while so our last stop was Infiniti. Got sold on the sedan right away. More bang and ammenities for the buck. Brawn and beauty in one tight package! Great value and truly picture perfect, ivory pearl w/black interior, with power to match! "
infiniti,g35,2007,Racer X, 04/24/2007,Infiniti revolutionized the sport sedan,4,"WOW, Someone please pinch me.  I test drove the Lexus GS 350, Acura TL, and BMW 328i and none compare to the Infiniti G35. The guys at Infiniti created an Isetoner glove with style, handling, luxury, around a powerplant that is like a cheetah on steroids. Needless to say, I bought it after I test drove it. Exhaust sound is a 10."
infiniti,g35,2007,SV, 04/21/2007,This car is a rocket,4,I have been a fan of of the VQ engine for a long time.  It is scary how fast it is.  My 97 Maxima turned out to be exceptionally reliable.
infiniti,g35,2007,Pinehill, 05/15/2007,New Infiniti G35x Sedan!,4,"This car is incredible, what an upgrade from a Toyota Camry - I have yet to hit the gas pedal and not be surprised by the responsiveness, everyone else on the highway is sitting still!  Great interior, easy to use everything (nav system, climate control, etc.)."
infiniti,g35,2007,S, 05/15/2007,7 month review,4,"Was an Acura man. Compared the G against Acura TL Type S. You get more car with the Infiniti. Got through a Maine winter with no difficulty. G35x model the way to go if you get any snow/ice. Step on the gas and you'll get thrown deep into the seat. Great cornering abilities too, I haven't been able to throw it loose from a turn. Phenomenal.  Couple issues though: audio system is not straightforward, MP3 cds can only be run in-dash player, voice navigation takes some practice (spend an hour actually programming it to recognize YOUR voice), cheap lining for sunroof breaks free too easily, drinks its 93 octane like a frat boy."
infiniti,g35,2007,Powers, 04/22/2007,Almost Perfect,4,"This car has it all - incredibly responsive, sexy interior, sexy exterior. In fact, I actually feel sexier driving this car.  I looked at Lexus, BMW, Saab and Acura and hands down decided this was the car for me. Mostly because of the tech packages and general sexiness of the car itself."
infiniti,g35,2007,M&M, 05/04/2007,G-tastic,5,"Have owned many European cars and if this does not scare them, I don't know what will.  Car rockets from a stop jerking you into the seat for what seems to be a roller coaster ride.  Rear seats are not really for a 6+ and if driver is 6+ only a small child can sit behind.  Handles like a dream."
infiniti,g35,2007,Nashvegas, 05/04/2007,Fast and furiously fun to drive!,4,"I've had this '07 G35S 6mt for just over a week and it's a just as much a  thrill looking at it parked as it is to drive.  I have all the available options (tech, premium, navigation packages, 4WAS, factory spoiler, splash guards, cargo net).  Shifting out of 1st is getting easier and the low-end gear power is awesome - I wouldn't consider the 5 speed automatic for this beast even with the paddle shifters.  My wife drives an automatic but enjoys this manual. It's very quiet on the interstate and the suspension is tight but not harsh - just what you need for a true sedan sports car. The quality is great from fit to finish - just hard to keep it under 4000 RPMs during break-in. "

My wife and I took it on a trip to Atlantic City, NJ and this car not only handles great, but has great pick up as well.  We got about 21 mpg highway.  I traded in my 2005 Lexus ES 330 for this.  I looked at the 2007 Lexus ES 350 as well as the IS and the BMW 330xi and the Acura TL.  This car blows them all away!  While the Lexus has a slightly smoother ride, the G's ride is sporty, but not rough.  The G also has more power that any of the others.  I got the premium, navigation, and technology packages.  The navigation is the best I've seen and the Bose stereo is outstanding.  "
infiniti,g35,2007,MMM3ike, 05/10/2007,The Perfect Japanese BMW,4,"I got my brand new G35 a few months ago and I love my new car. This car is so fast and stable that you will go 100 mph without knowing it. I ordered it in black on black straight from Japan, so I had to wait a month, but it was all worth it."
infiniti,g35,2007,John, 05/10/2007,Great car,4,"Traded in a Saab 9-5.  Test drove Audi A4 and Acura TL as well as Saab 9-5 but kept coming back to the G-35.  Technology /  electronics are amazing - back up camera, navigation system, etc.  Car rides well and is FUN to drive with outstanding handling and power. Great styling.  Mileage better than expected - getting 21 to 22 mpg on highway with cruise control."
infiniti,g35,2007,Andrew, 05/13/2007,Great Value,4,Very happy with the style and performance of the new G.  Best value in its class.  Handling is unbelievable as is the acceleration.  A great buy when considering the competition!!
infiniti,g35,2007,Howard, 05/17/2007,Easy decision,4,"I did my due diligence before buying my G. I have had a couple of 5 series 5 speeds and just felt that BMW was living of their name more than advancing their car. Test drove the TL 6 speed and did not like the handling or the stereo. Lexus has nothing to offer in the 6 speed (is250?). I test drove the G35 and it was an easy decision. This car has it all - luxury, power, handling, looks, reliability, power, GREAT sound from the premium package and did I say power. I have an I30 5 speed going on 150K miles that I have only put brakes on once. These cars are really made well. This is a no brainer."
infiniti,g35,2007,ghtrum, 05/14/2007,2007 Infiniti G35,4,"In 2004, I leased a G35.  I had 11 nagging reasons NOT to like this car, in spite of Motor Trend and everyone else.  These were poor sound, outside mirrors, gas mileage, seats, etc. In 2007, for financial reasons, I leased a new one.  There is NO comparison. The 2007 G35 is greatly improved over the previous ones and now is the car it was billed to be in 2003 and 2004."
infiniti,g35,2007,JC - Santa Claus, IN,"Past 300ZX Owner, All Grown Up Now.",4,"In my 20s and single, drove a 1994 300ZX manual, decked out leather. Now that it's been 10+ years and I am 32, my tastes and styles have hopefully improved. My thirst for flat out, eye watering performance has only grown.  My wife's toyota solara V6 was growing long in the tooth. As we looked for a new car, nothing made her really get excited, no matter the manufacturer or price range. I had shown her the Infiniti website and we were off to go find one. Once she saw the car and went for a spin. She loved it, I loved it. The car has intense performance and a refined style that seperates it from the cookie cutter Lexus and BMW set. If there is any question of safety and traction, go AWD."
infiniti,g35,2007,Dennis, 06/18/2007,What's there not to love??,5,"I started looking around and I narrowed my choices down to the Acura TL S-Type, Lexus IS 350, BMW 330i and the G35.  I am an avid lover of the BMW, the Acura would have been my second choice, however the G35 was what my heart told me to follow and I have not looked back since.  There is nothing bad I could find to say about the G35.  I ended up getting a black G with tan interior.  The 9.5 gig hard drive to download music to the car just blew me away.  I have owned about 10 cars in my life and driven several others and nothing in or near the G35's class can compare to the performance and handling of this vehicle.  Infiniti has upped the ante - can any other automobile step up to the challenge?"
infiniti,g35,2007,macbrew, 06/21/2007,Almost Perfect,4,"Turned in my '03 G35 for new Journey last week. Completely different car. This car feels bigger and heavier. It's quicker off the line but does not feel quite as sporty. Maybe because my last car had the sport package. I enjoyed the exhaust note on the '03 better. Got my '07 with all the options for under 37k. Test drove the Acura TL Type S, not bad but nowhere near the luxury or refinement of the G. The 330i was just too expensive with all the options. So far I'm really enjoying this car. If I could just learn how to use all the toys!!"
infiniti,g35,2007,Alan Fine, 06/22/2007,G35 Stands For Sport,4,"This is my second G35 Sedan Auto. I just sold my '03 recently and purchased this after comparing it to the BMW 335 and the Lexus IS 350. The G35 has all the electronic gadgets, awesome stereo, and is great fun to drive at a better bang for buck than any other car in its class. And it's reliable. Never one problem with my '03. Infiniti really improved every aspect of this car from the original."
infiniti,g35,2007,Pyrell, 06/25/2007,"Fast, fun and fiscally feasible",4,"After I tested the Audi A4 and BMW 3, the G35's agile handling, amazing acceleration and aggressive pricing sold me. This is my first Infiniti and I must say, it will not be my last."
infiniti,g35,2007,Richard Katz, 07/06/2007,Best Sport Sedan Value,4,"Intensively researched and compared the Infiniti G35 Sport to Acura TL-S, BMW 3 series, Audi A4, and Cadillac CTS. On paper the G was the best value. Test drives and now ownership confirm my research. The 6MT Sport Sedan provides ready power, a stable, sure and agile ride combined with a gently sloping, sexy upscale interior, large fuel capacity and best trunk size in its class.  Six speed manual transmission has a longish clutch that takes a bit of an adjustment - about two days in my case. The short throw shifter is crisp and decisive.  Exterior design is sleek and strong; people stop and stare."
infiniti,g35,2007,Glenn, 07/30/2007,2007 Infiniti G35X,4,I test drove the BMW 3 series and the Lexus IS 250 before buying my Infiniti. The Infiniti had the best ride and the most power out of the 3 cars I drove.  The BMW interior was plain and the Lexus had no power. So far my car has been a complete pleasure to own! I got mine in black and everywhere I go people compliment the cars looks.
infiniti,g35,2007,No, 08/03/2007,Not as fun as expected,3,"I bought this car because it was fast, agile and sleek. The exterior has aggressive styling that recieves many compliments, the interior is not very functional and hard to find a place to get comfortable. This car has so much plastic in it I am afraid it may melt if I leave it out too long. Even though I know the car is well built, I dont feel a sense of quality to it. The car has a rather potent engine but it does not grip the road well enough for having AWD."
infiniti,g35,2007,Bama, 08/18/2007,It's a G thing!!!!,5,"I was dead set on a BMW 3 series, but I thought the price was a bit much for a car without power tilt.  I looked around and finally came across the G35.  I drove from Reno, NV to Roseville, CA to test drive it.  After driving out of the parking lot I was sold.  I've had the car since 17 May 2007 and I absolutely love it!  The power is beyond what I wouldv'e imagined.  Handling is superb.  The sound system is great!  For $10k less than the BMW I wanted, I could not ask for a better car!"
infiniti,g35,2007,JR, 09/01/2007,Meets all expectations,4,I also own a G35 coupe and the sedan is every bit as pleasurable and performing.  The 4 wheel drive finally got my wife out of an SUV and in hard rains it's been extremely stable and predictable.  I'm getting 22.9 to 23.5 mpg on the road and about 19 to 19.5 around town. I'm glad I bought the tech package as the laser cruise control when there are 3 or more lanes is a very nice feature.  I don't and would not recommend using it on busy 2 lane  interstates.   Three things I don't like. When the wipers go on you have to manually turn the lights on. No automatic door locks once car is put in drive. The CD box in the trunk is a pain and makes loading luggage a chore and limits space. Get rid of it!
infiniti,g35,2007,cmansu, 09/01/2007,Wow,4,"This is an amazing ride.  It is fast, nimble and has every fun feature you could ask for in a car. I looked at the BMW 335 & Lexus I350, but this was a lot less money for the same car."
infiniti,g35,2007,Wayne , 09/09/2007,Gee Whiz!!,4,"Picked up my G35 AWD in August 07, loaded with nav, rosewood and premium package. The power this car delivers is absolutely amazing!!  You will get tempted to push it on the highway and other drivers seem to be tempting you to show them what you can do. You are getting a great product for the price. Very comfortable, responsive, and beautifully designed.  A definite chick magnet too!!  Just watch them stare as you zoom by."
infiniti,g35,2007,NYY Fan, 09/26/2007,GeeLoveULongTime!!!,4,"Hung on to my Honda Accord V6 Coupe for as long as possible (wife, 2 small kids and an SUV).  I was looking for a 4-dr sports sedan that offered sportiness, luxury, and room for 4. I set my sights on the G35x as well as the BMW3.  Once I had a look at the new lines and interior of the 2007 G and took it for a test drive a clear winner was declared.  The G35 offered nearly everything that the BMW 3s had with better reliability and for way less money - performance and value!!  After 10 months, and 15,000 mi. I just can't say enough good things about this car - I'm too busy driving it."
infiniti,g35,2007,Dave, 10/06/2007,Great car,4,"Love the car. Great performance and handling.  With the weather in OR I got the X model and am very happy with it. I drove all the rest and the G was the best car. This is my 3rd Infiniti and I have been spoiled by them. I had a problem a couple of weeks ago, the car overheated. Long story short, the dealer replaced the radiator and the air cond. pump in one day. No charge of course. "
infiniti,g35,2007,badgerfan6, 10/08/2007,Thrilling,4,"I just got my G35x about 2 weeks ago.  Wow!  I read the reviews so I felt confident with the purchase, thought I knew exactly what I was getting. I am happy to say that I received much more than I anticipated.  The styling is classy, the quality is impeccable and the power this car delivers is ""infinitely"" beyond my expectation.  The G has an impressive center of gravity that makes the car stick to the road in the corners.  I love all the techno gadgets as well including the nav and hard drive for storing my music on board.  The voice commands and the Bluetooth wireless for my cell is my favorite feature.  The fob key entry system rocks. This car delivers a flawless experience, end to end."

I commute 100 miles per day and comfort is first rate. Many compliments on it's style and appealing lines. Overall a very enjoyable car that makes the daily commute more like playtime. "
infiniti,g35,2007,Matt, 07/20/2007,Excellent Ride,4,"This is my 3rd car since college and definitely the best.  Granted the G35x is significantly more expensive than a Honda Accord or a Volvo S60, however, the power and comfort is amazing.  If you're a music fan, I recommend getting the navigation package since you can  burn your CDs on to a 9 gig hard drive for your convenience.  I'm not sure why the car really comes with a 6 disc changer since it's pretty obselete when factoring in the other feature."
infiniti,g35,2007,jt4404, 08/09/2007,Great Combination of Fun and Comfort,4,"I have just finished my first 1000 miles with the G35-S, and I have nothing but positive things to say about the car.  I was looking for something a little sportier than my Lexus E330, but, since I drive a lot, I also wanted a more comfortable ride than what a typical sports coupe had to offer.  This car delivers the best of both worlds, delivering a quiet, comfortable ride even with the ""sports"" suspension, while being responsive and powerful enough to provide the fun and excitement of a sports car.  And, by the way, very reasonably priced when compared to BMW, the Lexus G series, and other competitors in this class.  Highly recommended."
infiniti,g35,2007,Brian, 08/06/2007,Ammmaaaaaazing,4,"I have been researching this purchase for over a year now, ever since I found out they were redesigning the G35.  I was not impressed with the previous version's interior design or quality, but this redesign is incredible!!  I am a package kinda guy, meaning I like both interior and exterior refinement and the folks at Infiniti have got it right... and it blows the BMW 3 Series to the side of the road.  The get-up-and-go of this car is great.  The technology of the navigation system and audio systems is out of this world and the car just looks great!  I compared to the Lexus IS350, BMW 335, Acura TL, Audi A4. This car is number one!"

Unbeatable!,5,"I upgraded to the G35 Sport from a rather outdated Oldsmobile, so I was immediately impressed by the handling, power, and comfort. Not only is the car stylish, it can stand on its own when it comes to performance. The touchscreen GPS and bluetooth are great features that make driving much more convenient. Also, you have about 5 different methods to play music through the car, including the flash drive, in-dash hardrive, 6 cd changer, in-dash player, and the RCA jacks in the center armrest. Gas mileage ranges from 16 mpg in busy city streets, to about 27 mpg on open freeway at 75-80 mph."

Have the ""S"" pckge which makes car even better.
The ""S"" package is 18"" beautiful wheels, different front facia, side rocker panel, paddle shifters, sport seats.
Suspension stays same as stock which is nice blend for sport/comfort.
Bought used and have owned two years and put on over 50k miles.
ZERO problems with this car.
Reliability has been rock-solid.
Other than typical maintenance I have put nothing into this car.
Have always owned Audi/VW and even though the Infiniti interior isn't quite the fit and finish of the Audi it is close.
The AWD system in this car is flawless.
Drives like RWD until you need the traction in snow/rain."
infiniti,g35,2008,thew60, 07/28/2011,Dream car,5,"I had my eyes on this car since 2007 when it came out. I got my 008 G35x after getting rid of my 2006 Maxima which was great except for the pathetic turning circle. 
I purchased a pre owned car with 27K on it. Looks and rides like new. This is my dream car. Maybe I have low expectations of a dream car (Lamborghini maybe?) but I am realistic. The car is beautiful on the outside and inside. It is comfortable, quiet, has a killer Bose sound system, and handles fantastic. I had the same engine in my Maxima but you not know it here. The engine makes a sweet growl and has amazing power off the line and consistent through the RPM. Something Infiniti did with the drivetrain and they did it right !!"
infiniti,g35,2008,av125009, 02/11/2015,Exactly what I wanted and more,4,"Got this car to replace a totalled '02 bmw 325xi. Shopping for cars was a real disappointment, everything was either too underpowered or too expensive. Infiniti's value blew me away; I test drove a 2008 g35 and bought it later that day. Sure, the Germans make a smoother ride, but the g35 is quicker. The 306HP V6 is a blast to drive and its interior is feature rich and well designed. The nav system is very intuitive and well designed, especially the steering wheel controls. Rear wheel drive gives it a great sporty feel but is useless in the snow without proper tires. The gas mileage is terrible, I get about 13 mpg in the city. oh well, its worth it."
infiniti,g35,2008,nadia, 11/17/2015,I made the best investment,5,"I was sketchy about the price but i test drove this car once and bought it the same day. I love everything about the car! Feels like I am in a grand luxury car whenever I drive it. I have leather seats and a sunroof which is great for the hot and humid Florida weather. The exhaust sounds like a bad ass (: when turning on and driving off with the car. The power is strong. Gas mileage is horrible, but listen to the other posts, its WORTH it ! The tire to road frequency is great. Tires grip the road beautifully. Boast and sound system is not that loud hearing music from the outside, but the inside sounds good. I get about 20-30 mpg on the hwy and about 19-20 on the road. I'm a female so I don't drive harshly or roughly. My car has black stripes and is silver and I get so much compliments from it. I have 99665 miles on it and it drives like new. Maintenance is so expensive that is a con! If u cannot afford it, don't buy an Infiniti! Repair is not a big issue because I have not replaced much yet except for my hoses and battery  which is about 140 altogethor And that's it. After 100k drive belts and fluids are needed to be changed 8 years later and that's it.  Hopefully it will last another decade. Brakes don't last very long and they are very expensive when u go to the dealer !!! But other then that once u drive you'll feel very confident with the car because its so perfect.  I shoudlve gave the car interior three stars because the steering wheel chips and looks nasty so I put a cover on it and the doors are chipping and scratched on the drivers side so be gentle when it comes to cleaning products. Water works just fine.  The seats are so perfect. I wipe them with water and that's it. They are so climate controlled but I think because its leather and thseres a switch to warm up that seats when its cold . A/C works beautifully . another con is that my car is sooooo low !!!! When going over bumps, u must be cautious because I could hear the scratching noise under the car! Even when going slowly. Thank god under the car has a covering. After I'm done financing I'm going for a q45 or q50 which is an extension of g35/37

It's my 2nd G35 and as I ponder my next vehicle I won't be trading this in. I'll keep it for my daughter, but not my son.  The AWD and control of the car will bring me comfort when she goes off to college.  I've had no problems navigating through snow storms and blizzards and feel confident in my daughter's safety from Mother Nature. The Acceleration and Handling concerns me that my new driver son will not appreciate how far this vehicle allows you to push limits.  This is not your normal sedan. Understanding how most cars drive will make you appreciate this car's experience, even late in it's life.   Fuel economy is not great. Miles Per Gallon are traded for Smiles Per Mile.  I can't trade in this car when I get my next because there is so much more life in it than the market value reflects.  I have no regrets buying this car and driving it for close to 100,000 miles.  It's been a great experience.  My youngest daughter and her friend love when we travel in the ""vroom-vroom"" car.  Good times.

So far it has received 4 tires, battery, brakes and a radiator flush - that's it.  At over 11 years old, it is still going strong - peppy as ever and fun to drive.  I consider purchasing a newer model (not necessarily Infiniti) with newer safety, convenience and technology features but I don't mind saving the payments I might have for other things like travel.

infiniti,g35,2008,AtlNate, 04/10/2009,They should compare BMW to this car,4,"Everyone that is ""in the know"" about cars says this is the car to give the BMW 3 series ""a run for the money"".  Rubbish.  This car is quicker, sexier, and cheaper than its German counterpart.  Plus, I haven't even got to the interior.  Driving a BMW is like driving something an engineer built to a specification.  Driving the G35 is like something a engineer designed and then an interior designer architect and artist redesigned.  Its performance characteristics are superb, but more importantly, the car engages you.  Its beautiful curves and attention to design and detail creates an experience.  Remember, we (as humans) like things that look like us.  The car looks like a supermodel."
infiniti,g35,2008,Omahan, 01/02/2010,Had to Share,4,"I thought I needed to share just how good this car is.  From build quality, to reliability and performance, I can't really think of one thing I dislike about this car.  It is absolutely fantastic.  Since I own the X-model, I don't know how I lived though the midwest snow storms without it before this car.  Even after two storms of 10+ inches of snow this last month, I get around with absolutely zero problems!  Handling is crisp and performance from the 306 hp engine is great!  Just an all around fun car to drive that looks and rides great.  The back seat is actually big enough for two adults to comfortably get in and out of, unlike the 3-series BMW which I've also owned.  Great car!"
infiniti,g35,2008,DSK, 12/02/2010,AWESOME,5,"Just purchased and am blown away by the performance of this car. Need AWD and compared to Audi A4 Quattro.  This car is a beast and is unbelievably fun to drive.  I am ecstatic and can't wait to drive it.  You owe it to yourself to test drive one of these if you are in the market.  I had a hard time not tipping my hand in front of the dealer, it is that much fun to drive, ridiculous value.  Infiniti is very helpful as well."
infiniti,g35,2008,Babjak, 10/04/2017,Stalling issues,2,"This car is a death trap with the random stalling at slow speeds.  If you get one of the many lemons like I did, then this will be a problem you either chase or decide to take your losses and trade away.

Love the performance of this car.  Very fast and great styling.  Just coming from a Lexus ES330, this was a very sporty car that is fun to drive.  I bought the car used from a coworker and he showed me where the transmission had to be replaced by warranty from the dealer at 64k because it would not go in reverse one morning, so i felt like I got a new transmission.  I bought it at 66k and overall it's a fun car when it doesn't stall constantly.  They've cleaned the throttle body and this doesn't seem to fix it.  it is stalling pretty much daily.  There are no codes thrown so of course the dealer warranty cannot duplicate it.  The interior is so cheap too.  Coming from Lexus I thought Infiniti was similar but this is so not true.  Cheap leather looking seats that are about to crack, arm rest is cheap plastic that is already cracking, door trim and steering wheel trim has black paint the peels off.  Rubber trim on outside of window is cracking and flaking off.

I've always liked the looks of the G35 so I decided to test drive one. It was all over after that. WOW is all I had to say. I bought the 08 early this year because of the rebates, only paid 32K for it with the Sport and Premium packages. I still have my 03 Maxima which I like alot but I let my sister drive it for now because I just can't see letting it sit (and sit it would as long as I have a car like the G). The VLSD (vicious limited-slip differential) and paddle shifters add to the FUN factor for sure. I'm 29 and feel like a kid in a candy store every time I get in my car."

As a driver who spends almost all of his time in stop-and-go driving, the gas mileage is a little subpar (17-18 mpg in the city, but much better on the highway).  I expected this, however, when purchasing this car. Overall, I am thrilled with my car and would recommend it to anyone who wants a laundry list of features in a reasonably-priced, luxury car."

I LOVED the G35 from the time I sat down until the time I left the dealership last!  To get the MOST enjoyment from the car, I definitely recommend the Sport option for the added bonus of the seat upgrade!  Granted the different sized tires may be a problem for some, but I have had to buy sport tires on my last 2 vehicles so am used to the cost!  Regardless of some of the other ""complaints"" on the car, the gas mileage is a non-issue...unless you are coming from a Honda Civic or Mini- Cooper! 20 MPG city/25-28 MGH HWY is great for a PERFORMANCE SEDAN"

My G35S is fully loaded with aftermarket chrome detail work. Since my purchase I have been ecstatic and have woken up everyday with a smile on my face. The interior is exceptional in both design and comfort. With more standard luxury options and equipment than the 328, such as HID Xenon headlights, leather upholstery, and keyless entry with push-button start. Bottom line, if you can live without the prestigious German nameplate, the best value for your money is the Infiniti G35 Sport 6MT. "
infiniti,g35,2008,Mark, 07/28/2016,Doesn't drive as good as it looks,2,"After owning this car for two years and driving it 15,000 miles per year, I have to say that I am quite disappointed. It’s a very beautiful looking car and has stood the tests of time very well, and hasn’t needed anything yet. Granted that mine has very low mileage for its age, I can always count on it taking me where I need to be without fail. 

But the driving experience is lacking in so many areas. Compared to other cars on the market, it feels very “amateurish”. Kind of reminds me of Kia cars during that initial phase when they were trying to make the brand more appealing to consumers but still weren’t tuning the driving dynamics right. The 2010+ G37 coupes and sedans are better vehicles, but as for the 2007-2008 G35 sedan, there were numerous kinks that had to be worked out. 

The car just doesn’t feel confidence-inspiring. The whole thing is just too unpredictable and I never feel like I have proper control over the vehicle. It’s stubborn in the way it behaves on the road and the vehicle never listens to driver inputs. 

The thing that probably bugs me the most about the car is the transmission. The 5-speed automatic is counterintuitive, sloppy shifting, has a tendency to hunt for gears, and rarely puts you in the correct gear required for the situation. I guess I could have went for the manual but my options were limited at the time of purchase. 

The gears are all spaced very close together and it always shifts too early, cutting off power and denying me a large reserve of the advertised 306 horses. In stop-and-go traffic, the transmission shifts through its entire gearset during the 10 feet you’ve moved up in traffic and annoyingly holds the gears long after you’ve let off the accelerator, like you’re “stuck” in the gear. On the highway it revs at over 3,000 RPM because of the tight spacing between all the gears, making you think you were driving a 3-speed automatic. The shifting can also get pretty violent which makes driving this car a headache. 

Another thing that bugs me is the engine performance. Doesn’t have a linear or predictable torque curve. It’s very soft on low-end torque and needs to be revved out a great deal to keep up with other cars on the road. Engine is very loud and course sounding and because of the sloppy powerband it’s not really so much of a joy to ring out either. Most mainstream cars have more smooth, predictable acceleration and meaty grunt off the line. G35 does not have that and other cars on the road will be going faster from stop light to stop light than you. Often times I find myself missing that smooth, seamless, meaty, refined feel that my old Volkswagen had even though that car had a fraction of the horsepower. 

The steering feels artificially heavy, like they tried to go after BMW’s chunky/hefty steering feel but instead they put effort over feedback. Steering doesn’t feel predictable or communicative..just simply difficult to turn which hampers the maneuverability. Doesn’t have a good on-center feel and the steering doesn’t always give you a good idea of what the front tires are doing. Turning radius could definitely be better. 

The brakes are soft and don’t provide much confidence or linear stopping power. They feel like Sentra brakes...or maybe even a step below that. I’ve tested the brakes and the car the stopping distance is very long compared to other cars I’ve had in the past. You need to keep a big distance from other cars in front of you because the brakes probably won’t save you in a panic situation, which I find somewhat unacceptable in any modern day vehicle, especially a sport sedan. 

The cornering abilities are disappointing. It feels very heavy in the corners and makes you (along with your loose items in the vehicle) feel like you’re being sucked into a vortex around a slight bend in the road. After exiting the turn and getting back on the gas, literally 99% of the
 time the transmission won’t put you in the correct gear to propel the vehicle back up to speed.

The car just drives very amateurish. While everything operates as it should going down the road, the car behaves very stubbornly and leaves much to be desired. 

On top of everything, the gas mileage will empty your pockets. 

While the vehicle has made it to 60,000 miles, I could see it needing transmission/drivetrain and suspension repairs in the future. These components of the vehicle simply feel very low-rent feel to them and I don’t see them standing the tests of time. 

Material quality and ergonomics are also seriously lacking. I’ve seen car interiors from the ‘90s hold up better. Storage solutions are lacking and the armrests are practically useless. 

My advice if buying this car is don’t be fooled by the advertised 306 horses. The car certainly doesn’t feel like it was built properly for that kind of power, and you rarely ever get to use them. Maybe skip the “X” and go for the RWD “S” model with the manual and the active 4 wheel steering...

infiniti,g35,2008,GT69, 08/14/2009,Our first luxury car,4,"My wife and I bought the G35 as a ""retirement"" car in anticipation of taking long road trips. We have been extremely satisfied with the comfort and convenience of this car. We particularly like the navigation system and other technology features, such as the color back-up camera and CD changer. This is our first ""luxury"" vehicle and we enjoy the feeling when we hand the car over to the parking attendant at our favorite upscale restaurants in Atlanta."
infiniti,g35,2008,Mark, 06/16/2019,5 year owner review,3,"I've owned my G35 for 5 years now. My car has almost 100,000 miles, and it doesn’t necessarily hide its age. I am disappointed at the general wear and tear of the car. While it has been fairly reliable in the time that I’ve owned it, the leather seats are wrinkled (especially the driver’s seat), the dashboard is warped, the material around the window switches is practically all peeled off, part of my gauge cluster is lacking illumination, the interior has a good amount of rattles, the tires make tons of noise on the freeway even after a rotation and balance, the steering has some play in it, and I recently had to pay $400 to get my exhaust repaired due to rust. While it starts every day and drives just fine, I wouldn’t say that this car has been “dead reliable”. There are some things that pop up every now and then in the annual inspection, and it definitely drives like a car with 100k miles despite being well maintained throughout its life. 

One thing that might be a dealbreaker for some is the interior space. The G35 feels kind of cramped for a regular sized 4 door sedan. I’m 5’11 and my head occasionally touches the ceiling even with my seat in the lowest position. There’s not really much room to rest your arms and just relax…everything just feels a little too clustered from a space and ergonomics perspective. The seats themselves are pretty small and I don’t imagine them being comfortable for a larger individual. Rear seat legroom is not that pleasant either, although it is tolerable so I’ll give it that. The seats are plush to sit in. 

Road noise is definitely on the louder end. The engine is fast in the upper half of the tachometer, but you really need to wring it out sometimes to feel those 306 horses. If you’re someone who likes ample power down low, you probably won’t like the G35. Sometimes I wish the torque would come on earlier in the rev range, as the G35 can feel a little gutless around town, or generally in situations where you wouldn’t be thrashing the engine that hard. It gives you some nice brute force when you thrash it, but it’s definitely not the smoothest or the most refined engine. I borrowed a family member’s Honda Accord recently, and it was a nice change of pace driving a car with a smoother and more linear power band. The G35 is definitely rough around the edges, so I wouldn’t recommend this car if you aren’t into that sort of thing. 

Probably my least favorite aspect of the car is the 5-speed automatic. If I could make the purchase again, I would have spent more on the G37 with the 7-speed auto. The 5-speed is just really jerky, slow to shift, and it doesn’t pair that well with the engine. It always wants to upshift before the power band hits, and the revs sour past 3,000 rpm on the highway in top gear. It makes it easy to pass, but it’s not so good for the fuel economy, and I imagine excessive highway driving would cause wear to the engine due to the revs being so high. Overall, the 5-speed just doesn’t cooperate that well. It really bogs the car down and makes what should be a very good sport sedan feel kind of sluggish.

The G35 corners well. It’s definitely better than a FWD family sedan. This car does feel heavy and the suspension wallows a bit, so I don’t always feel encouraged to whip it around or fly around corners all the time. For example, when you’re on the freeway and making lane changes, the chassis feels like it wants to sway and wallow just a little too much. Many people with G35s tend to upgrade the sway bars for that reason. When you do take a regular corner hard, the G35 grips pretty well and the body lean is kept to a respectable level. The tires almost never squeal on me even when I’m going much faster than I would normally go in a regular sedan. I do wish the steering felt more direct and not quite as heavy in these situations, though. The steering is definitely missing the
 crispness and the refinement that you would find in a German sport sedan. It doesn’t always keep the vehicle on a steady course, and I find that the steering requires excessive correction on bumpy roads or when driving over lane indents. On normal pavement the steering feels fine; well weighted and a decent amount of communication. I do wish that the steering dynamic was a little more “premium”. It’s rough around the edges like most aspects of the car, and it has just a little too much play around center. 

I also find that the accelerator has a pretty significant amount of dead travel. The initial response is fine, but from about 1/8th throttle to half throttle, there’s just not much that happens. It makes it a little more dramatic trying to maintain a constant speed and keep up with the pace of traffic on the freeway. The brakes are also a little chattery and could feel more powerful. Overall, a good car but you do kind of get what you pay for. It's more reliable than the German competitors, but not quite as refined or premium.

infiniti,g35,2008,DannoK, 09/28/2010,Not a German car,4,"Seems obvious, right?  The car has been way more reliable than the German cars I've owned, but the build quality seems below their standards.  It's 2.5 years old now and the dash above the steering wheel is warping, the rubber gaskets around the doors are starting to crack and there are wear marks on the rubber coated parts of the steering wheel, and no, I don't wear any rings!  It's a great drive, though!  Always plenty of power, plenty of gadgets and very reliable."

This car captured my eye from the moment I spotted it during my search for the best car in my price range. At first what really got me into it was it's stock 306hp V-6! And good thing because if it were not for it having a more powerful engine than the Acura TL Type S, I would have never even considered this car as an option. Now moving onto the inside (where I really fell in love with the car) you see a gorgeous speed/tach gauge setup with a barrage of buttons all with the perfect touch of accent lighting.

infiniti,g35,2008,jennifer, 08/12/2010,ok car,4,I have had my car for about 2 months now and the performance is awesome.  I have always driven sports cars and this one definitely out performs most of them. It is a very fun car to drive but I have had issues with the poor gas mileage. I understand with over 306 HP you aren't going to get the best gas mileage but why have a  performance car if you can't drive it like you want.  I also am having issues with the brakes squeaking and my car only has 25k miles on it.  I guess the brake pads have to be changed frequently on the car. Wish I had known that before I bought it.

I recommend the premium and navigation package. I got the sport package because I liked the look better of the vehicle, but I don't like the sport seats they're a little stiff and  tight for me and I'm an average size guy. Over all this is a great vehicle. The handling and speed is what makes this car fun to drive. Make sure you test drive this vehicle before you decide on a new car."

We also own a 2008 BMW 328xi and I prefer the Infiniti in daily driving, and even enthusiastic driving. Better overall performance, more comfortable, better and easier to control. The bang for the buck factor is a no brainer. Got every single option on the car for 39,500, and this is sport and AWD, with every package. Handled a snow storm in the Rocky Mountains outside Salt Lake City in January better than my old Jeep GC would have. Also is electronically limited to 130 mph (salt lake flats). Cannot recommend this vehicle more strongly. "

The Passat and the Murano were nice but not in the same level, the Lexus was heavy and at times I almost had to shake the car to move, and the BMW though handled well, wasn't as much fun as driving this or even half as decently equipped. This car impressed me from the get go. It handled well on the curves and on the straight line. It is smooth to drive, and I can hit 75 effortlessly. The interior is extremely sleek, the Japanese finish is a nice touch and the seats are very comfy. The backup camera takes trust but it is easier than I thought to gain."

I did a lot of research and test driving (Lexus IS 350, BMW 335i), but I was always partial to the Infiniti G35. I love the exhaust note!! This was a no brainer. The Lexus and Bimmer were $7k and $10k more respectively with the same options. I got mine fully loaded.  The car has wicked acceleration! The quality of the materials inside the cabin are better than expected. The paddle shifters work great in manual shift mode.

I was initially in the market for the A4 and test drove it couple of times. Although the A4 drives well, the 08 model felt a little cramped even in the front. The Infiniti dealership was right next door, so decided to stop in to test drive the G35. Was sold on it instantly. Great handling and power, not to speak of luxurious and (relatively) roomy interior. Reminded me of my friend's 924 that I used to occasionally drive couple of decades ago. "
infiniti,g35,2008,Ben in LA, 09/08/2008,Best Bang for Buck!!!,4,"More comfy than Lexus IS and more sporty than ES 350.  Audi, BMW & MB can't compare in terms of value/performance."

I came from an Acura TSX, and find that the G35 has less trunk and interior space. The gas mileage is bad, but I knew that up front; I'm also concerned about the summer tires and their longevity. Otherwise, I can't extol enough the rocketship engine and handling of this vehicle! The ride is amazingly smooth on the highway, but nice and firm at slower speeds and on twisty roads. Fit and finish is outstanding, and get lots of compliments on the look. I searched far and wide for wood trim (surprisingly hard to find!), and think it makes the cabin seem much more open and inviting. I look forward to driving to work every single day."

While gas mileage is subpar, my feeling is that I did not buy this car with the gas mileage as the primary concern.  Love the Nav system, AWD, as we live in the Northeast and the looks I get when I pull into a parking space.  Highway driving is fun as the car has a tight feel to it and is very responsive.  By far the best car and value in its class."
infiniti,g35,2008,R J Childet, 09/20/2008,Impressive Value Under Radar,4,"  The car handles extremely well, and unlike the general Edmunds' Review, I do not sense an artificial feel with steering; more of a euro steer feel. It also has great response and superb quickness. F&F quality is very high and as good as any higher priced lux vehicle I have seen.   Cornering and sharp turns are spot on without any ""pitch back"", more like BMW.    Only have 9k miles and only one criticism so far: the ""studio on wheels"" needs better radio/tuner component than current Clarion unit. High end is only average and mid-range sound is terribly weak. Whats more is the radio has no adjustment for mid- range. Unbelievable in 2008 with car stereo and market long matured."

It was the only one I walked away from being ""blown away"" by. Also, for the money compared to the 3 series, it is a steal!! You are not going to find a sports sedan with all this offers for a better price. Period! I'm 6'4 and I'm very comfortable in the G35x."

I wanted an all-wheel drive car with good technological features, as well as something that I could DRIVE.  I looked at another Passat, but the V6 4-Motion was as much as this car.  Easy decision there. This has been a great car so far.  Love the acceleration and the handling.  The interior is first rate.  When compared to the BMW 3**xi, or the A4, it hands down the best value.  More horsepower, more features, less money."

It is a bit annoying that you cannot input directions on the nav while on the move, but we'll get over it.  If you are in the market to purchase a car, I recommend you take a look at this car.  There is not a vehicle out there that has the features that the G35 comes with at such an affordable price.  Awesome job Infiniti! "

Very tight turning radius for a car this size.  Road noise is a little more prevalent than in competitor's models, but not bad overall.  You can feel the transmission shifts a bit.  This car has a lot of power for a 5-speed.  Likely corrected with the 7-speed in the '09.  For me, the MPG has been trending at 17 over the first two months of ownership.  I'm a little on the aggressive side, but previous cars haven't penalized me as much as this one does."

Frustrated, dumped it in 08, too many trips to the shop!  Looked at the Maxima (never a fan, but liked the new look in 09) LOVED it, but couldn't pay $37K--more than the G. Drove the G, power kicks the 325.  Who needs this sort of power?  The brakes, lovely, the growl, exhilarating and no tranny lag when punched.  Smooth, sure footed (though not as much on mountain roads as the BMW) and quiet.  The drive train hump encroaches into the foot-well so front passenger's left leg/foot tilts at an odd angle.

infiniti,g35,2008,Me, 12/17/2008,Great First Car,4,"I am 16 years old and I received this as my first car. I got the black on black with navigation and all those nice amenities. This is for sure an amazing car. I only have around 2,500 miles on it. It's a quick and cool car. I have one of the nicest cars and campus and its definitely a head turner for other teenagers. In the 4 months I have had it, it has been good to me, besides a few unfortunate scratches. Not a single dent when I got hit in the parking lot. Quality."
infiniti,g35,2008,peter, 12/20/2008,Defective G35S,3,"This G35S with summer tires would not survive in a snow storm.  I'm battling with Nissan with a suspension, steering or tracking problem as this car is way too sensitive to road crown compared to every car I've driven, it drives straight in the right lane but would crash into the woods next to the left lane as soon as the hands are off the steering wheel, after alignment done on it 3 times, Nissan is refusing to acknowledge this quality defect while all 3 of their loaner cars I've driven drove without this problem, I would trade it in for an AWD especially living in the NE, a RWD just won't cut it in snow.  It's worse than a Maxima SE, don't waste your money"
infiniti,g35,2008,jg, 10/14/2007,2008 G35 Sedan 6MT Great Ride!!,5,"Before everything else, test drive this car right away.  It feels superior to drive and handles excellent.  Gas mileage is surprisingly efficient.  Driving with the 6 speed manual transmission is a little tricky as the car feels extra responsive to your every move so it can take a little getting used to even though I've driven a manual for years."

infiniti,g35,2008,Mark, 06/06/2008,08 G35xS,4,"Trading in my 2005 G35 6MT that I upgraded from 298HP to 350HP for a 2008 G35xS was a bit concerning because I wanted the same horse power feel and was concerned the sedan would lack the 'feeling one' with the car experience.  I also needed something for winter. I will say I'm really surprised by how responsive the automatic 306HP of the sedan deploys itself. Having said that, I HIGHLY recommend anyone getting this car to the G35xS, which adds the 18"" wheels and the paddle shifters. I will say the car comes to life when in manual mode, much differently then just driving in automatic.  With that I will say I'm quite happy and the car now provides the same confidence my previous G did."
infiniti,g35,2008,lgm, 06/07/2008,Blast with no Run flats!!,4,"Looked at the 3 series, the Lexus and the Audi.  It came down to a toss up between the BMW 335 and the G35.  BMW interior felt dated, and they had the Run flat tires.  Chose the Infiniti, and love it."
infiniti,g35,2008,Best BUY!, 06/20/2008,G35 vs CTS & 335i,5,"I comparison shopped for 2 months and compared equally-equipped vehicles.  I looked at many cars in this luxury sedan category and narrowed down to the G35, BMW 335i sedan, and the Cadillac CTS 3.6L.  To sum it up, the G35 was more bang for the buck, had a more luxurious feel when driving it, and looks absolutely incredible (mine is black).  I love this car and have no regret."
infiniti,g35,2008,Lou, 06/22/2008,Deceptively Fast,5,"After evaluating the Merecedes C350, BMW 335 and the Lexus IS350, I recently chose the Infinity G35XS. One of the compelling reasons was the value for the dollar compared to the others.  Infiniti offers the power, sport/luxury look with the latest hi- tech technology for under 54k tax-in.  Hard to say no to that."
infiniti,g35,2008,Sam, 07/01/2008,Best of the Rest,4,"I was not going to try this car even cause of it's offbeat styling. But, I test drove it. My bad! I had to buy it. A Japanese car with German performance. No brainer. At times, I think that I should've bought the BMW for the brand recognition, but then I remind myself of my past unreliable experiences with the Bimmer. All in all, this is a fabulous car to drive."
infiniti,g35,2008,cd_moreno, 07/04/2008,Best Nissan Product Yet!,4,"WOW! That is all I can say, this is my fourth Nissan product I've owned. When I was in the market for something new, I knew G35 was at the top of my list. I picked up a G35 X with the newly delivered Sport package. What an amazing vehicle. Tight suspension, steering, incredible features, fun to drive. Gas mileage is really bad but I don't care because every time I drive this car the smile on my face is priceless, acceleration is amazing and even though this car is extremely heavy, it hides it's pounds. Incredible styling, beautiful to look at.  The best purchase I have ever made."
infiniti,g35,2008,Nick, 08/22/2008,Best in Class,4,"I recently leased an '08 G35x, to replace my outgoing '06 G35x.  I love both vehicles.  The new G is slicker and more ""refined""--the automotive press had complained that the previous version was lacking in this department.  Acceleration is effortless at any speed, in any gear.  Handling is tight and predictable.  Some luxury buyers may find that the ride is a bit stiffer than they like.  However, the G does not pretend to be a Lexus - this is a sports sedan.  I've driven everything else out there, including various offerings from BMW, Audi, Lexus, Acura, Mercedes, etc.  Hands down, the G is the best sports sedan for the money which is why I'm on my second one. "
infiniti,g35,2008,Dan M, 08/24/2008,New G35,4,"Test drove many before I narrowed it down to the Acura TL and the G35.  G35 was a much tighter drive and the exterior lines are much better and more unique.  Only had for two weeks, but to date, I am very happy with the car. Was going to purchase the Blue slate but when I saw this in the sunlight it was too close to black. I thought Lakeshore was too light but it is perfect in person.  Not too many running around town either. "
infiniti,g35,2008,tennisgal, 09/13/2008,Still happy....,4,"I have LOVED driving this car for almost 1 full year.  I was treated to many snows over the past winter and was very grateful for the AWD handling that this car offered.  I continue to watch the competition and offerings and am still happy with my decision.  Can't tell you enough how I do not miss the FWD ""pull"" from the steering in my 2004 TL!"
infiniti,g35,2008,J. Gonzalez, 09/15/2008,Lakeshore Slate G35 Journey,5,"My wife and I purchased the car the last week of Aug. The G35 was an excellent choice over the Lexus E350 and BMW i528. The car handles well and is fun to drive, also like all the features which are easy to reach. My 9 year old son loves it the most and prefers to sit in the front seat. Worth every penny!"

Easy decision, the G35xs is fun to drive and comes at a great price. Car handles great - not as responsive as the BMW but not a big difference. The graphical user interface is the best in the industry - the iPod interface is amazing and the Nav graphics are great and I love the rear back up camera.  If you are considering the BMW 3 series you must look at this car, it will change your mind. I got the G35x with the sports package - which came in auto and not stick, but the paddle shifters can be fun.  "
infiniti,g35,2008,LeAnnStar, 10/08/2008,Best car yet!,4,"I had been wanting a G35 for a while and read many reviews. I was very apprehensive to buy one because everyone complained about the gas mileage. I get at least 23-25 mpg. This car is great!! I had a 2006 Mercedes C230 previously. I love this car so much more. It is beautiful inside and out. It is sporty, yet classy car. "
infiniti,g35,2008,Boston Infiniti, 10/09/2008,My New G,4,"Traded in a Nissan Murano (wanted something a little more sporty) and have been extremely impressed with the performance of this car.  Ride is sporty without being too firm and the fit and finish is fantastic throughout.  If you're looking at this car, I highly recommend the navigation package as the Music Box hard drive (stores music to the car) is a great feature.  The only downside to this package is the trunk-mounted cd changer that takes up valuable trunk space.  Overall this is a great alternative to the BMW 3 series and the value factor can not be beat."
infiniti,g35,2008,JRC, 11/27/2008,G35X,5,"I wanted a vehicle with reasonable performance, all wheel drive, navigation and adaptive or intelligent cruise control. After factoring in reasonable price, (Edmunds Incentives and Rebates section saved me thousands) the list became a toss up between the EX35 or the G35X. I chose the G35X as it has been on Car and Drivers 10 best list. Great car. Infiniti offers more technology and performance for the price than any other make. My dealer experience has been very pleasant also. "
infiniti,g35,2008,2nd Car, 12/03/2008,Plenty of Bang for the Buck,4,"If you get this car I highly recommend the Premium Package.  It includes the completely integrated iPod hookup (Lexus does not), a sunroof, upgraded stereo, and more comfortable seats with the seat assist feature.  My first car was a Camry so the 306 hp performance is a definite upgrade.  I love being able to pass and merge at will.  MPG  has been 20 mpg so far vs 30+ with my 4 cyl Camry.  This is not a full size car so if you are going to have frequent backseat guests you might consider something larger.  A few of my friends have BMWs but they were very impressed with the look and performance of this car.  For the money I don't think it can be beat. "
infiniti,g35,2008,BSmith, 12/15/2008,Family Sport Sedan,4,"This is an excellent choice for anyone wanting a performance sedan that's usable in daily life.  The performance is stunning, but it seats four comfortably and has a reasonable trunk.  The suspension is more sporty than luxury.  Selectable comfort/sport suspension settings would be nice. Overall, this is one of the best cars you can get on a ""normal"" budget. "
infiniti,g35,2008,smitty1515, 12/25/2008,08 G35x,4,"I am writing this review after ~6 months of driving. I love the car and did a bunch of shopping prior to my purchase. I live in MN so an AWD or FWD vehicle was a must. I test drove the following vehicles prior to my choice of the g35x. Honda Accord Coupe, Nissan Maxima, Lexus IS250 awd, Lexus ES350, and Nissan Altima. The G35 was a combination of all the vehicles and really offers the power and luxury which could not be surpassed by any of the aforementioned vehicles.  I drive in Minneapolis rush hour daily and the snow mode comes in quite handy when the weather takes a turn for the worst. I constantly try to lose control in this vehicle on secluded country roads and it's almost impossible."
infiniti,g35,2008,MSP G35X-S, 01/11/2009,Fun - Great Value - Nav Needs Work,4,"I looked hard at BMW, Audi and Infiniti when I was looking for a new car. Each had similar driving characteristics, but I ended up with the G35 because of the value of the content for the price. Living in Minnesota, the AWD feature was important, and the addition of the Premium, Navigation and Sport packages the price just couldn't be beat.  Great linear acceleration with the right sounds. Sticky in the corners with the granny system on, but easy hang the rear out when you turn it off. Beautiful looks outside, nice inside. AWD is great in the winter with the all-seasons.  The nav system is restricted from most functions when the car is in motion thanks to the lawyers - really annoying."
infiniti,g35,2008,lovemyG, 01/13/2009,Couldn't be happier,4,"I admit I'm biased, I wanted the G since I saw the first photos of the 2007 model.  I waited out the lease on my previous vehicle, then searched for more than a month to find a 6spd Sport.  I live in upstate NY and took delivery in late November at the start of snow season; after nearly 2 months, I have no regrets about buying RWD.  A set of Blizzaks all around, plus VDC and a light touch on the throttle and clutch, and I haven't had a problem at all.  The G is everything I wanted; stylish, sophisticated, RWD, 6MT, with all the tech gadgets I could ask for.  A friend rode in it and commented ""Nice, but not a BMW or Audi.""  Which is exactly why I bought it."
infiniti,g35,2008,paulo6, 01/26/2009,Seems to be better with age,4,"Just hit 4K miles and got the 1st oil change. I got the Sport package. The car seems to now loosen up a bit, giving it a higher FUN-TO-DRIVE. My 2006 6MT was more fun to drive, but this 09 xS edition is slowly catching up "
infiniti,g35,2008,Sam, 03/09/2009,A great car,4,"I have been eyeing the G series ever since the first one came out. My 1998 Accord finally gave me fits, so it was a chance to hop into a G35. I had a great deal on the 2008 vs. a 2009 so I decided to pull the trigger. I love the interior, and the color scheme. The Premium package is a must. I like the G35S but at $2200 more, I decided to go without. I love the way it looks, and the manu-shifting is great. Not as instantaneous as a 6MT, but I rarely race, if ever. All in all, would definitely do it again. Didn't care much for the navigation (already have an awesome $200 Garmin) and the CF slot. With an iPod and an MP3 CD player, who needs CF?"
infiniti,g35,2008,Scott, 01/02/2008,Best Value in Entry-Lux Segment,4,"G35 value beat A4, TL, Accord, BMW 3.  Exterior design very seductive, except black patches in front air dam.  Keyless locks/start button are amazing.  Excellent interior design; quality and ergonomics.  Driver memory system is awesome.  Excellent fit & finish.  Accelerator a bit touchy, but wow - love the torque.  Handling is amazing.  Ipod interface is just OK.  Lighting scheme very cool.  Tranny lacks refinement, with ""thump!"" from 2nd to 3rd under hard driving.  Add a 6th gear: 70mph runs at 3200 rpms.  Getting about 18mpg in mixed driving, 23 hwy at 75mph.  This is a performance vehicle.  Has room for improvements, but for $10k+/- less than Lexus IS350 or BMW 3, it can't be beat.  "

Came down between TL-S or G35x, finally decided on a G35X w/sport package, premium pack, and nav. We didn't want to go through the rattling problem with Honda cars. Love the sporty look of the G35X with the 18"" rim and the safty of all-wheel drive living here in jersey. So far no complain, we had three honda automobiles and this car feels much tighter build. No more rattle from my previous two cars (tsx and accord). Looking forward to drive it everyday. Can't wait pass the 500 break-in miles and let the throttle open on the highway.  "

Driving it off the lot I felt great I thought it was a reliable car for my wife. In the Arkansas rain my wife hydroplaned and ended up in on coming traffic. The so called traction that this car has is supposed to help it stay on the road but it doesn't and when the slip light comes on you are already all over the road I thought it was just my wife driving bought some $1000 tires to go on there to make sure she was safe and then it happened to me but I was able to keep control of the car. AC runs very loud."

This was it. I had an Infiniti QX56, but with gas prices, I just could not afford to let the tags, insurance, and now gas eat away at my pocketbook. This car is fun to drive. This car is awesome. My G35 Sport has the automatic/manual/paddle shifters on the steering wheel which makes this car more fun to drive. The only thing is that since I drive this car fast, I wish it had a bigger gas tank."
infiniti,g35,2008,David, 03/25/2010,Sedan & Sports Car in One!,4,"I was looking for a replacement to my 05 Audi 3.0 Quattro. I have driven Audi's for years and thought I would be purchasing another. Then I test drove a used G35xS for the first time. Never looked back. I have owned many cars over the years and this is by far my favorite. Great all-around vehicle with all of the technology and toys for less money than an Audi, BMW or Lexus. I avg. 20 mpg in mixed driving. This car is a screamer.  The ""S"" package takes it to another level with the sport seats, paddles shifters and beautiful 18"" rims.  Make sure you test drive one of these if considering a sports sedan w/ AWD."
infiniti,g35,2008,dmac, 03/29/2010,Really great car,4,"I bought this car used at 2 years old with 17,500 miles on it and saved $10K off new. Very fun to drive and stable. It eats gas though, which should be expected. Not as silky smooth to drive as a Lexus, but much more beautiful to look at. RWD fishtails badly in snow, even with stability control. If you live in a snowy area, get the 4WD for sure. Steering pulls strangely at stops on uneven pavement which the dealer told me was normal, but it is a bit unsettling. Acceleration is great (esp. from 50 to 80) and the controls are easy to use. I love to drive it."
infiniti,g35,2008,Aubrey179, 04/25/2010,Perfect car so far...,4,"I have had absolutely no problems with this vehicle.  I purchased it about 70 miles from my home, because I did have an extremely rude experience at my local dealership (Auto Place Infiniti, Buffalo, NY).  I am sure the Infiniti company would not stand by that behavior, and I presume it was an isolated event, however, inexcusable. Rochester's Dorschel Infiniti, its email/purchasing communications, were flawless! It has been extremely reliable, with nothing but maintenance costs, thus far.  I do wish the fuel economy was a bit better.  And the only technical quality gripes I have with it are that the side view mirrors are not heated, and the trunk lid quality and closure feels a bit cheap."
infiniti,g35,2008,AZ Driver, 05/28/2010,Enjoying the ride,4,"Hit the 2 year/30K mile mark and thought a review was in order. Journey model with sport, premium, Nav, and technology package. Fun to drive, handles well, accelerates without difficulty, beautiful to look at especially the interior. Negatives are the tires wear quickly (not unexpected), small blind spot on driver side, the front exterior dings easily from rock chips (as does the grill), and the 6 disc changer decreases the opening in the trunk to get things in/out. No problems with the dealership but haven't had any issues to deal with. "

I don't have any cons to report except for the snug interior and narrow seats, but that's why they call it a sports sedan.  This car ROCKS!  It is very fast and a very attractive vehicle.  I traded in a 2007 Maxima SE and haven't looked back since.  My G35 turns heads and at takeoff will pin your head back. I wish I could find a raceway so that I can really stretch it out. I would highly recommend this vehicle for anyone who's in the market for a car well worth the money.  It's cheaper than a Lexus and the BMW. Neither one of them compares as far as price and performance are concerned."

So far I really do like the car, and coming from an M3, the performance is right up there.  Other cars I looked at were the BMW 335ix and Lexus IS350.  Both were OVER $10k more expensive and the Infiniti had more features.  I really like the interior of this car too, far more than the $10k more expensive BMW.  Seats are very comfortable and it has a nice high-end look to it without the price.  I think you cannot go wrong with this car for $38k, 300+ HP, great interior, nav, stereo, keyless start, etc."

I am coming from driving a powerful Mustang GT with a V8 and a lot of horsepower.  And I must say this car is hands down my favorite car that I have ever driven.  This was my dream car and I found a way to get it.  This car packs more features then any car I have ever seen, and for the price completely knocks out BMW, Lexus, and Audi.  I had test driven every single car in the class from the 325xi, Lexus IS350, Caddy CTS, and Audi S4.  I have to say without a doubt the G35 is hands down the best car.  Infiniti rocks!"
infiniti,g35,2008,Gary, 02/21/2008,So much fun,4,"I traded in my BMW 323i for this car and about the only regret that I have is that this car is a bit longer, other than that, what a car!  It's also great that I got a great deal on it.  You get so much for your money with this car.  I got the Premium Package and the Nav. Package and think they're both great.  I had debated buying the car without the Nav. package and then buying a portable device but I'm happy I went with the built-in as they tie in so many other things to it.  Since I listen to music a lot I'm really happy with the music choices (iPod, Compact Disk, radio, or CDs).  And this car has the power when you put your foot on the gas."
infiniti,g35,2008,t ham, 02/23/2008,Muy Excellente,4,"AMAZING engine with immediately ready torque and speed. With this comes less than average fuel economy and that is ok, you can't have both.  I think it's doing around 18 overall, and for those of you who ride about 5-8 mph over the speed limit, you'll be at 3200rpm at 75 mph. Like I said, it's the trade off you get for such a hungry engine. I'm not sure if a 6th gear would fix this, but I think that may make this car perfect. The tan leather with real wood trim is very rich looking. Easy to use nav & controls. Simply put, it's the most fun car I've ever driven and it's not even close - add Japanese reliability for icing on the cake. Bravo Infiniti."
infiniti,g35,2008,Carter, 02/24/2008,2008 Infiniti G35 is a perfect combo,4,"I bought the 2008 Infiniti G35 with the Premium/Nav/Sport packages. This is by far the most fun car I've ever had the pleasure to drive. From the excellently designed body to the excellently detailed interior, this car has it all.  It has a wonderful balance of luxury and sport mixed together. The interior is fantastic with the sport package if you like the more modern feel. If you like the luxury feel more, I would not get the sport package because the seats are firm but very solid.  If you want a better performance, you need to get the sport package. Either way, this car is such a wonderful balance of both worlds. Excellent car!  "
infiniti,g35,2008,Shpyntik, 02/25/2008,"Not so great as expected, but still...",4,"I'm a little disappointed by my G35S. It's a great car with an excellent engine, nice interior, great exterior, all the gadgets and a posh sound system. But it has several HUGE flaws - horrible transmission and clutch!  First of all it is VERY hard to launch it smoothly and quetly, too much throttle and it surges like a bull, too little and it shakes like its got an overdose. Let go throttle at 1st gear and instead of slow smooth engine braking you get uneven and abrupt deceleration, horrible feeling (and you look like a fool too). Second - very LOUD drivetrain noise. Third - under hard acceleration the car starts to shake violently, as the tires gain and loose the grip, very disappointing."

infiniti,g35,2008,KM, 03/04/2008,What a ride!!!,4,"I love this car! Drove BMW, Lexus, Cadillac this beat them all hands down. A great value. This car handles so great I never thought I would enjoy my daily commute. I have never had so many people tell me they love my car. Have to drive one to truly apperciate how great this car is."
infiniti,g35,2008,hatteras56, 03/04/2008,A1A Daily Driver,4,"Having owned 2 BMWs (3 & 5 series) along with an Audi allroad, I have a frame of reference to compare the German ownership experience with that of the 2008 G35 (sport, premium and navigation packages). Nothing can touch a Bimmer coursing through the S curves but my new G 35S is a powerful sedan that hopefully will provide years of satisfaction.  This car is simply gorgeous and packs more technological features that cars costing many thousands more. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
infiniti,g35,2008,piredon, 11/02/2007,Better overall than 335xi,4,"Test drove the 335xi as a benchmark. It's a great driving car, but the inputs are all touchy and the interior made me feel claustrophobic, and it's pretty barren.  G35 wasn't on the top of my list, simply because I've never cared for Nissan products in the past.  But I told myself to give it a try, and boy am I glad I did.   This car has a far nicer interior than the Bimmer, more features for less money, and achieves 95% of the performance without a turbo.  Handling is spot on, although steering could use some work.  Ride is firm, but body motions are well controlled and bumps are noticeable rather than jarring. This thing wants to be driven hard.  I just wish we had no speed limit."
infiniti,g35,2008,RbM, 11/06/2007,Loving my 08 G35 Journey,4,"I was all set to buy a 2008 Caddy CTS until a friend took me into the Infiniti dealership to look at the G35. Long story short, I bought the G35. The Infiniti is a superior product with excellent pricepoint, quality, reliability and longevity ratings.  Mine is the Journey with Tech package, Premium luxury package, sport wheels and Rosewood interior.  The combo of the Journey suspension with the 18 inch sport wheels/tire are the perfect balance for comfort and performance in my opinion.  The satin finish on the Rosewood interior is very similar to the wood finish used in the BMW 7-series."
infiniti,g35,2008,DrewI, 11/06/2007,Wow!! What a Ride,4,"Finally pulled the plug on buying a new 2008 Journey with the Sport package, nav, premium. What a blast to drive and what a beauty to look at. Better yet, this probably is the most intuitively designed driver's cockpit that I've seen.  My friends who have BMWs are still trying to learn how to work their nav while I'm burning CDs onto my in-car jukebox without a user's manual. Amazing! The best steering wheel you can imagine. If you're thinking about buying this car, do it.  "
infiniti,g35,2008,diomecius, 11/07/2007,Awesome Car!,5,"In looking for a new sport sedan to purchase, I knew in the back of my mind that I would probably get the new G35. After I test drove it, it was a no-brainer. Everything that I was looking for in a car, and less expensive than other cars I was looking at. It looks good from any angle on the outside, with a roomy and quiet cabin on the inside. The center console is logically arranged, plus it looks awesome at night. The clutch is smooth and quiet, the shifter is short and sweet, and an excellent driving position is easily found with 12-way power seat. Back seat is roomy enough. Has plenty of technology if you opt for the NAV, PREM and TECH packages."
infiniti,g35,2008,RLN, 11/04/2007,I'm sold on Infiniti,4,"It is really hard to find fault with my 2008 G35.  I love the car, the way it drives, it's fit and finish and comfort.  I would like to see better MPG than the 17.4 it averages around town.  The engine has power, pleanty of power.  The auto transmission is unbelievably smooth.  The ride is solid.  I'm very satisfied with the car."
infiniti,g35,2008,August Ong, 11/30/2007,Tossable 6MT!,4,"Break-in miles finally past, now I'm able to use the full RPM range and push handling limits! So far, flawless. The G35S feels light and nimble. Steering is very direct and engine flexibility (low rev pull) is great. Interior noise level is low, what I expect for a luxury sports sedan. Only quibble is a noisier than normal clutch, or just needs a bit more insulation. Stock RE050A tires grip very well, although won't last with that 140 treadwear. Interior materials seem durable and well designed. Comprehensive options nav, prem, tech, esp liked the superb driver's seat bolster adjustments. Fuel economy could improve though."
infiniti,g35,2008,Arnold, 11/18/2007,"Technology, Speed, Handling & Value!!!",4,"Premium, nav. I test drove both this car and the FX.  Wasn't thrilled at the idea of 15mpg or the bigger price tag. This car accelerates wonderfully and I'm not worried about sway as I was with my SUV. "
infiniti,g35,2008,rn79870, 11/24/2007,Almost perfect!,4,"Absolutely great to drive.  I love the transmission and the rev match downshift.  Driving down a longer hill, tap the brakes and the trans moves down a gear and the assists in braking.  Love it.   It is the smoothest transmission Ive ever driven (includes MB, Cad and Lexus).  Seats are very comfortable.  Interior is very quiet, and wind noise is close to non-existent. "
infiniti,g35,2008,PBenjung, 03/09/2008,Fun to Drive - Just a Little Cramped,4,Superb acceleration and holds the road well.  A good looking car with features you can't find at the price.  I chose this over the Acura TL.  The TL is a quieter driving experience but it doesn't have the raw power and machismo of the G35.   
infiniti,g35,2008,LRV, 03/09/2008,Wow! Drive it before you buy an Audi/BMW,4,"Absolutely fabulous, and a huge step forward from the 2003 G35 my wife drives. The interior is just below Lexus level, but not by much. The premium navigation/commmunications package is truly wonderful. The engine has rocketship thrust, even if it's a little unrefined compared to BMW, Lexus and Audi. I have been averaging 20 mpg on the highway, and am driving like a regular guy-- nothing too crazy, and not like Grandpa. If you can, get the sports package just for the seats if nothing else. Bar raised!"
infiniti,g35,2008,Lance, 03/11/2008,2008 Infiniti G35 is the perfect combo,5,"I am so excited about this car. It offers a perfect combination of modern luxury with a perfect sport feel to it. The power is excellent and handles the road with ease. I can't say I test drove any of the other comparable cars but I didn't get that far because the G35 was the first car I drove and I was sold instantly. I went all out and got the Sport/Navigation/Premium package with the spoiler. I love the spoiler. It adds a perfect but not tacky touch. The technology is awesome and I feel like I'm in a space rocket. To me, this car looks best with a black exterior but that's just my opinion."
infiniti,g35,2008,infinitilover1, 03/14/2008,I love this car!!,4,"Just traded in my 05 G for a new loaded 08.  Loved the 05 but the 08 is even better!! Feels more solid behind the wheel, nice more muscular look, and the 306 hp really gives you a buzz.  This is the best mid-size sedan on the market, and for the money one of the best sedans period.  This is my 5th Infiniti and never anything other than routine maintenance on the others. Expect the same on this one.  Check this one out for sure!!!"
infiniti,g35,2008,jagguar, 03/14/2008,The Perfect (Luxurious) Sports Car,4,"I wasn't originally looking for a car in this class but when I saw all the features I just couldn't help myself.  I was looking for a fun sporty car and this is exactly that, but with a lot of luxury thrown in as well.  It's comparable to the BMW 335i (better IMHO) in performance, comfort, and luxury.  It has virtually all the luxury features of $50k+ luxury cars.  If you're looking for a car that's fun to drive, the G35 is unrivaled.  And it fits 5 people comfortably too!  The clutch is stiff but easy to get used to.  And I strongly suggest spending the extra 5k to get the nav.  All the features that comes with it are awesome! I wish I got the tech package."
infiniti,g35,2008,dave, 12/05/2007,G35x,4,"I bought the Infiniti in November of 2007.  After a month of ownership I love the car.  The features and their accessibility are exemplary.  The iPod connectivity allows me to access all the directories of the iPod via the touch screen (and steering wheel controls). The options I bought were the Premium Package, and Navigation."
infiniti,g35,2008,Chris, 12/06/2007,Infiniti 4 Life,5,"I honestly wanted to purchase a BMW 325i; however, in the end I ended up with an Infiniti G35. Why? In a nutshell, the G35 is ""The Ultimate Driving Machine."" The driving experience is unmatched and the exterior as well as the interior are beyond belief. The exterior is well sculpted and the interior design is spectacular. The car handles like a charm. Monitor the speedometer at all times as it is easy to hit 100+ mph and not notice it."
infiniti,g35,2008,docmartin2, 03/22/2008,Not one regret,4,"Bought the G35x last month and absolutely love it.  Smooth ride, all the bells and whistles, and the power under the hood still surprises me.  Not the greatest gas mileage, but comparable to most competitors.  Looked at the BMW 335i and the Lexus IS 350 and I have no regrets about choosing the Infiniti."
infiniti,g35,2008,Maniac, 03/24/2008,What a car!,4,"I have owned quite a few sedans over the years and this one is my favorite by far.    I just traded in my Dodge Charger R/T for this 2008 G35X (w/ Premium & Nav), and I have to say this sedan absolutley kills my dodge in every way (including performance).  Being a computer consultant, I love all of the technology packed into the car. Voice commands actually work like you expect them to, the backup camera is awesome, iPod integration rocks.  I could go on and on.  Performance is great for a sedan like this.  Faster than my hemi dodge for sure.  The AWD is amazing and seamless.  I feel like I'm driving a RWD with LOADS of grip.  Much safer for my wife to drive in the wet and snow!"
infiniti,g35,2008,Martin, 03/27/2008,Performance AND Luxury! WOW,4,"First I drove the Lexus IS 250, Saab 9-3 Aero, Acura TL and S-Type, Honda Accord (v6), and Audi A4 (v6). ONE test drive in the G35x and it was a done deal! The dealer let me keep one over a weekend and I didn't want to give it back! Purchased the S option with paddle shifters. Talk about fun!!  This weekend drove 70 miles to and from my father's house for the holiday: and if my wife had told me she left something (anything) back at my father's house I would have repeated the trip instantly just for fun!  BMWho?"
infiniti,g35,2008,loudog2, 03/31/2008,Fun to drive car,4,"Since I have a work truck, I wanted something fun to drive on the weekends. I always liked the G and even the I35s before it.  The ride is smooth and responsive.  I don't notice the wind noise people are talking about.  The nav and controls are easy to firgure out."

I had Infinitis before and they were all great, never any problems and great dealer service. This g35x is the best one yet. I love driving it and it has so many great tech items on the car."
infiniti,g35,2008,John, 04/08/2008,Best deal in its segment,4,"I test-drove TL, BMW 328/30, A4, IS 2/350 and decided that G35 fit our needs with the best price. I really wanted the RWD version but wife wanted the AWD (I also wanted the 6MT but wife cannot drive stick).  Steering is slightly heavy at low speed.  Fun to corner at the exit ramp and interior feels very luxurious with the luxury option and nav.  Nav however tells you weird, roundabout directions. Bluetooth, nav, voice command work together nicely."
infiniti,g35,2008,david, 04/16/2008,Best ever,4,"I have owned 30 cars since my first in 1966 and this is by far the best. The performance and technology are awesome. Intelligent cruise-control is the best feature ever. Burns gas like hell, but burns up the road like hell, so I'll except the tradeoff."
infiniti,g35,2008,Turner, 04/17/2008,This car is very smooth,4,"From the first time I saw this car at the dealership, it caught my eye. This sedan is well built and provides a classy but yet sporty look while delivering performance with a modern interior. The performance is awesome and so much fun to drive but what makes this car is the interior in my mind. It's not as luxury as the Lexus but it's 10K less too. It makes the BMW interior look childish. I would definitely suggest going with the Navigation and Premium Package. If you want a smoother/softer ride, don't get the sport package. But the sport package is nice and delivers in a great way. I guess it's all about what you want. All I can say is, go test drive one. Infiniti is here and with a great car."
infiniti,g35,2008,AZDBACKS, 04/20/2008,Terrific for the price,5,"2008, Premium/nav/sport package. Owned for 2 weeks.

infiniti,g35,2008,Wanda, 04/27/2008,2008 Infiniti G35,5,"After test driving the C class Benz, my husband and I stopped at the Infiniti dealership. I was impressed by all the extras and once I drove it, it was a sale. Awesome vehicle for the family and I have pre teenagers. My oldest son is very tall and it's a tad bit head bumping when you go across a hump, but it is fun, sporty, luxurious, simply perfection. I've owned a civic, accord, prelude, saturn, expedition, suburban, mustang, quest... no comparison. I'm in love with my vehicle. I'm averaging 20-no compliants from me! Not one single complaint."
infiniti,g35,2008,CoryR, 04/27/2008,A great decision,4,"I have always thought the G35 was stunning when one pulled up behind or beside me, but I never realized that the beautiful craftsmanship carried over into the interior as well. Beyond the looks of the car, the performance of the sedan is unbelievable. Choosing between the 3 Series and the G35 was a no brainer once I got behind the wheel of the Infiniti!"
infiniti,g35,2008,UofMG35, 05/03/2008,Best Sports Sedan under $35K,5,"Unmatched performance for the price. Acceleration, handling, braking are all at the top of the class. Fuel economy is decent considering the performance (I get 20 mpg, with 75% city driving). Packed with luxury features like touch screen nav, back up camera, iPod interface, bi-Xenon headlights, Bluetooth, voice recognition, etc. Interior is roomy with great seat comfort (driver seat has 16-way adjustment on Sport model). Can't go wrong with a G."
infiniti,g35,2008,crushut07, 05/01/2008,Best Decision Ever,5,"I went through an exhausting research process to decide on a car. I read every review, and drove more cars than I can count. Eventually, I narrowed it down between the '08 Accord Coupe w/ Nav, Audi A4 3.2 Quattro, BMW 3 Series, and only had the G35 left to drive. After I drove the Infiniti, I realized there was no comparison. The power, handling, and comfort are incomparable, and the price is incredibly reasonable for such an awesome car. I have people compliment my car everywhere I go!"

But this car is fantastic! The Premium and Navigation Packages are a must when getting this car. The performace of this car is awesome. It's very fast and smooth at accelerating. I can get in and out of traffic when I need to.  My favorite part of this car is the interior. It's very Modern but also has a luxury feel to it as well. The controls are very well laid out and look fantastic. I get so many looks in this car. I think it's much more sporty looking than the Lexus and also the BMW. All I can sy is make sure you test drive one when comparing to BMW? Lexus and you will see what I mean."

I am past the days of status statements with automobiles and started my search from behind the wheel test driving cars with a budget of 55K.

infiniti,g35,2008,dori, 05/24/2008,2008 G35x is the car to beat,4,"Of all the many cars I owned, this is the most fun and best thought-through car.  Handling, power, road feel, road-noise level are all first class.  The navigation and the rest of the electronics are wonderfully integrated and easy to learn and use.  The screen is very bright and is useable even in sunny days.  The 3 ways to control most functions (voice, knobs and touch- screen) make it fun abd easy to use under all conditions.  The trunk access is too narrow, with a high barrier so that placing groceries and baggage is a hassle.  Driver seat can not be pushed back enough for my frame (5'11"")."
infiniti,g35,2008,Fergus, 05/25/2008,Over Rated,4,"Held off on commenting until I hit the 5000 mile marker. First interior is well done and attractive.  However, I find the engine with the automatic is poorly done.  The sport shift is comical with down shifts that don't make sense especially at lower speeds. Handling is ok, but not great, the review in edmunds is bang on - artificial. Brakes are spongy and translate road feel through the wheel which I find disconcerting.  Fuel economy is brutal.  I drive mostly highway and I haven't broken 18 MPG even with heavy use of cruise control.  There is a reason why everything is compared to the BMW... it is far superior. Finish is suspect. Already have rubber coming off my driver side door. "

Very unlike some of the others that I have visited.  It has all the power that I could use while still remainign civilized.

The stock exhaust is just amazing when you turn it on and the interior design is really nice as well.

infiniti,g37,2008,Matt, 11/22/2010,I'm a car guy again!,4,"Bought this car 2 days ago and traded in my Lexus ES 350. The Lexus is truly a fantastic car for comfort and fuel economy, but it requires you to lose your man card. My past cars have been Mustang V8's, Saab 9.5, BMW 525 and Acura TL. I've only driven the G37 about 4 times so far, but I love it and can't wait to drive it again. It's quiet and comfy when you want it to be, but can certainly growl and perform with the push of a pedal. Some say the brakes are touchy, I say precise. Some don't like the ""off the line"" acceleration, buy a true sports car. Some don't like the trunk space, IT'S A COUPE! Head space? I'm 6' 190, no problem. I'm a car guy again!"

I'm 5'3"" and find the G very comfortable. Like another reviewer said, it's a little light on response, need to anticipate acceleration or use the paddles or tap over into DS mode for more immediate shifts.

infiniti,g37,2008,Dean, 04/17/2019,"2008 G37s 6MT , 37K miles, stock, rare model.",5,"Among the last of a dying breed.  I was sick and tired of waiting for the next gen 2020 WRX (now definitely 2021) so I had to buy a used but reliable manual transmission sports coupe.  Manuals are going the way of the dodo w/few exceptions so I bought this cream puff from Carmax in Sterling, VA last month. Previous owner cared for this car like no other - garage queen - and even put a clear bra on the front end!  I’ll drive it a bit more than he did, but will try to keep it in near mint shape. Reliability, handling, braking, acceleration are all still great despite being 12 years old.  Seats are a bit narrow (need to lose more lbs) but still comfortable for long drives.  The tech is old, but a $20 Bluetooth FM transmitter allows me to stream content from my phone. Navigation is useless as WAZE is far superior in every way (just charge your phone while using Waze as it eats power).  Funny how all the reviews from 2008/9 lauded the tech when it was new. Mediocre mpg? It’s not a Prius.

I wish owners would stop modding these things within an inch of their lives. It’s like finding a unicorn when a low-mileage unmolested 6spd MT becomes available. I was just lucky (3 years of patience helped) to have found this one.  If you find one, JUMP on it - just be sure to have it inspected as there’s a known issue with the “galley gasket” on 2008-2011 (maybe some 12’s too) which can be a $3500-$4000 repair. Mine doesn’t have it as of yet, but I bought a 6yr/100k mike warranty from Carmax just to be sure.

One year update:  Everything is great overall.  It took about a month to get used to the abrupt clutch take-up/engagement (only drive once per weekend).  I’m used to the crappy clutch on this car but after a year, it still requires concentration to start the car smoothly from a stop.  As such, I avoid driving in traffic and areas where I’ll have to stop and go While driving uphill. I even go out of my way to take the highway despite the added miles.  MPG is 21 overall but would be 22 or 23 if I lived a little closer to the highway.  Only other snafu is after an automatic carwash, a drop or two of water leaks in and drips down on the top of the door trim next to the side view mirrors on each door.  I know, how dare I not wash the car by hand.  I will starting next week.  The A/C works great, but I wish I could figure out how to turn the fan on with recirculated air without the A/C compressor turning on (if its even possible in this car). After reading the G37 forums I learned that there’s no way around the referenced A/C flaw.  If you want fresh air and the fan on, the A/C automatically turns on.

Eight month update:
Unable to pump gas into the car yielded an expensive repair inside of the gas tank which was once covered by a TSB, but not anymore.  Carmax warranty paid only $240 of the $700 bill.  Despite this, I still love the car. Everything about it is good except a much-too-abrupt clutch.  I bought an aftermarket pedal set which will resolve the abrupt clutch issue (not yet installed).

Now that the weather is getting cold and the snow will eventually herald the first road salting here in Maryland, I won’t be driving the car much longer. I have a trickle charger to keep the battery topped off and will start the car periodically to keep the internals well lubricated.

June 2020: no snow and salt on the road only 1-2 times which was washed away by all-too-frequent rain so I was able to drive the car a lot during the winter. I kept the summer high performance tires on and luckily it was mostly above 40 degrees the entire season so there were no tire grip issues.

A few months back the driver’s side shoulder seatbelt adjuster fell of and I luckily keep a leather man tool in the car so I was able to reattach it to the pillar using pliers.

I replaced the plastic engine splash guard tray under the front of the car myself (torn off).  Bought the
 part for $30 online and Spent $60 on ramps to raise the car to do the work.  Infiniti wanted over $200 to do it so it was $$$ we’ll spent.

For $20K there’s nothing better than this car, but if I were spending $30-$40K on a used car I’d opt for a mint Corvette Z06 from early to mid 2000’s. I’m not having buyer’s remorse though.  The next gen Nissan Z is due in 6-12 months and will have Infiniti’s 400hp V6 and a manual transmission.  That may be next😜

12/4/20, 19 month update.  Still loving this car!  Yesterday I installed an HKS Hi Power cat-back exhaust.  Sounds amazing at all revs with no drone.  At the same time, I added front and rear Eibach sway bars. A great handling car now handles even better in the twisties. Battery is starting to go. Will upgrade with an Interstate AGM battery from Costco.

One of my fav features are the seats. The music box is all I listen to now and is awesome. Tires are starting to feather a bit on front already, will most likely give me the dreaded tire growl at only 4K. yuk Nissan. MPG 20, who cares, this is a sports car and yes I run premium. Absolutely love pushing that start button every morning and hearing that feral sounding music in back. "
infiniti,g37,2008,erik McComber, 10/30/2018,My Fourth Infiniti Coupe,4,"The title says it all.  I wouldn't be on my 4th one if I didn't love them.  They have the reliability of the manufacturer (Nissan). I frequently see them listed in the classifieds with between 150000 and 250000 miles.  I've had three G35s and now I'm on a G37.  The only car that I've owned I liked better was a Porsche 911, but at $250 an oil change and what I would consider a minor repair costing $3,000 I quickly soured on that. The only thing that I wish they came equipped with or offered as an option was interior wooden trim.  They hold their value extremely well. You rarely see them for sale in my area.

infiniti,g37,2008,jbro, 07/27/2009,Much improved coupe!,4,"I traded in a 2007 G coupe 6MT for a 2008 also 6 MT.  The shifter and especially the clutch in the 07 was awful.  The 08 is improved although not perfect.  Otherwise this car is amazing in every way.  It's really a little surprising that Nissan can make this car for this price point.  It really looks, feels and drives like a much more expensive car.  Really unbelievable!!!!  Great job Nissan and your Infiniti cohorts.  In my first 1000 miles MPG, hiway is 24-25 and expect to improve a bit with break-in.  Only change would be to give just a little more off the line, although I imagine that would stress the components more with 330 horses on tap.  Also would be nice to see the rev match shift!!"
infiniti,g37,2008,Lance Charles, 02/11/2016,The Batmobile,5,"Only by this car if you want to be noticed. I have owned my G37 for 8 years and over 134,000 miles. Only had one problem that requirex non-warrenty repair. I dont get into my car, I put it on. This car was made fot the highway. It out accelerates just about anything else on the road is highly manuverable, and is rather nice to be in for long drives ( I had a 1 hr commute). I would buy it again...

infiniti,g37,2008,Randy, 07/25/2008,G37 S - Not your daddy's sports car,5,"The G37S is the epitome of luxury sports cars.  VQ engine is Nissan's BEST and it shows.  Power is great, tuning is great, 330 Hp and 270 ft-lb of torque is what keeps you behind the wheel. Looks great and turns heads. 20 MPG city is reasonable (it's not a hybrid) and reflects actual mileage.  Definitely a winner over 350Z, 330i, Audi, and altima coupe.  This may be your last chance to own a high-powered sports car with a REAL manual transmission as CVT and slushboxes are getting more acceptance with their ""fake"" shift controls."
infiniti,g37,2008,Jgoldz, 08/02/2008,Can't Beat it For The Money,4,"As an owner of Acura, Lexus and Mercedes I have to say this trumps all of them in what you get for the money. The car is fast, affordable and fun. Can't beat the two year lease Infiniti usually offers on the car. Other favorite features include attention grabbing looks,and intuitive navi system. However, the build quality could be better on the car, where I've had a problem with the muffler in the first few thousand miles, although that was only on early models from what I've heard. Also, I wouldn't label the car a true sports car since in the corners it could be a little more nimble. 3 series beats it in that. Overall, an amazing car and still my realistic dream car that I'm so proud to own"

Have a big dent in the cool looking aluminum inside door handle where seatbelt flung back and tagged it. Goes fast enough for me. Happy with it. Got a speeding ticket my first month and I wasn't even speeding. Cop had new Dodge Charger interceptor. My first sports car. Wheels get caught in ruts in interstate, and have to constantly readjust when driving. Moving GPS map is very helpful. Cell phone to car interface is way cool, so easy to use.  My teenager kids love it too. Don't like speedometer, missing many in between numbers. "
infiniti,g37,2008,Jeff, 02/06/2009,Great car!,4,"This is simply the best car I have ever owned, sporty tuned ride with luxury interior, beautiful leather!  My z4 was too stiff!!  The G37 was not only the best value but the best car under 35k period!  The A4 is under powered as is the 328i which comes with fake leather in the base...  Its only comp is the 335i and the A5 but they cost so much more! and the 335i just isn't that comfortable to drive!"
infiniti,g37,2008,Dave, 04/24/2009,Great Midlife Crisis Fix,4,"I bought the G37 for myself as a 40th birthday splurge.  This is the best sports coupe your money can buy without completely splurging and buying a Corvette.  Plus, it seats 4 halfway comfortably!  I've owned this car for over one year, and it still feels like a new toy every time I drive it, or even look at it.  I'm a very thorough researcher, and I couldn't find another car with the performance, looks, and features of this one in the price range.  Once I test drove it, the decision was a complete no brainer."
infiniti,g37,2008,rgaz, 06/12/2009,Drive one if you can!,5,"I can reiterate all the good reviews.  This car is fun to drive in all conditions and can smoke the tires with ease.  I recommend driving with the VDC off so you can really have fun.  The VDC can be a bit too overbearing for my tastes. First let me say that the G37S is hands above most cars to compare, so my very minor complaints are just because when you stare at almost perfection, you are bound to find something.  The 5-speed shifter throw is too long for my tastes.  For a sports car the 1-2 shift should be the shortest possible, and it is not.  Again, minor.  The tires are great combination, but in the larger rims, they are very expensive to replace. Really, a great car.  Drive it and see."
infiniti,g37,2008,drw128, 12/10/2009,Infiniti got it right,4,"I've owned an ivory pearl manual for 6 months. This car, for this price point, is unmatched (if you are looking at BOTH performance and luxury). The design is simply breathtaking. With ivory pearl paint, it's such a head turner. Ironically, G37 has a high exclusivity for a bargain price at its class. Interior is very nice, although could do with a little more insulation. The 3rd gear is what I call the auto gear because it is perfectly tuned for city driving, although 2nd gear is the real deal. 6th gear is the gran touring aka cruising mode. Overall, funnily, G37S somehow feels and looks more expensive than it really is. Count it: design, performance, exhaust, Nav, feel, price. All in one."
infiniti,g37,2008,speakerman, 02/26/2010,Amazing Automobile!,4,"I researched for several months before purchasing the Infiniti G37 coupe.  The reviews which praised its performance were right on.  It not only features awesome acceleration, but has the best brakes I have ever experienced.  Interior fit and finish are excellent.  I purchased the ivory pearl exterior, and I'm regularly getting comments on its beauty."
infiniti,g37,2008,TrueTaiChi, 08/24/2007,G37 captures the German auto gestalt,5,"I just test-drove the G37 Sport automatic. My first impression: this is the first Japanese car I've driven (I own the G35 6MT with the Brembos) that feels exactly like a German sports car. Seriously. The Sport G37 is tight and solid, with a really surprising balance of sport verve and comfort. The car really feels likes a BMW or Mercedes, but with more edge. Yet it is still distinctly Japanese in its design, if not feel. The exterior is probably the most sumptous, sophisticated sport car design out now for a production sports car. The interior is slick, with cool details, such as the outstanding brushed alum ""washi"" trim."
infiniti,g37,2008,Javier, 09/06/2007,Great Coupe,4,"I love this car! It reacts immediately when you hit the gas. The shifting is smooth. The interior looks great. All the accessories make it perfect. It corners really well at high speeds. It looks great. Before I bought the 6 speed manual, I test drove the automatic. The automatic was a complete letdown for me. The shifting was not smooth at all and the acceleration was not there. It's night and day between manual and automatic. I can't say enough about the G37. It's simply awesome."
infiniti,g37,2008,Kappa88af, 11/30/2007,All I thought it was,4,"I test drove the Porsche 911, BMW 335 & M Roadster, S2000, Corvette and decided on the G.  I have the Blue Slate w/every option except 4wheel steering.  I've had the car for four weeks and I don't regret a thing.  The power is on point, the electronic gismos are easy to operation, handling is responsive.  I haven't opened her up because of the required break in period of 1200 miles.  I'm at 800 now.  Pound for pound, you can't go wrong.  This is my first Infiniti product and I'm loving every minute.  A word of caution.  On model produced after July 07, you lose some of the voice features such as telling the car what temp to change to and what radio station.  Other that than you will be pleased"
infiniti,g37,2008,skim, 05/05/2008,"Best sport coupe under $40K, bar none!",5,This is the best car I have own in my life so far.  I test drove BMW 335i prior to this vehicle.  Both cars felt very fun to drive.  Is BMW worth extra $5K?  Definitely NOT.  G37's styling looks much sportier than 335i coupe.  Redlining at 7500 rpm feels like a true sports car!  The sound of the exhaust is truly awesome!  I look forward to drive my car after a long hard day's work.  19 in rims look great!

Not only does it have a 330 HP engine that is fun to drive but all the features and options this car has is unbelievable. The Bose system in the premium package is one of my favorite things about this car. It is so clear and if you like loud stereo's, you can crank it up to really feel the 2 10"" subs. Everything from the design, performance, luxury and affordability makes this car a must have for any sort of car enthusiast.  "
infiniti,g37,2008,Mehdi Arani, 05/11/2008,Unbeatable,4,"I had MB-C320 and I was thinking between Audi A5, BMW 335 and G37S.  I test drove all three several times and at the end, the G37S was the winner for several reasons and number one was the deal that I got.  My G37S is fully, fully loaded, I get the performance, look, options, responsiveness, speed and power that I wanted for half price of A5 and I am very happy with my decision. My friends come over to my house just to go drive around with the car.  I get good compliments all the time in the streets.  The only thing is gas mileage when I push the gas otherwise I do get 17/27 but when I push the gas it would go down to 12/18."
infiniti,g37,2008,Dublinguy, 05/20/2008,A Blast to Drive,4,"I love this vehicle! It performs as well as a 3 Series BMW, without the extra increase in price that the BMW has. It looks much better than the BMW too! I got the 6MT and the engine feels like it just can keep going with no problem. Beautiful finish and top-notch quality of materials round out an awesome package. My only little quibbles are the lack of more storage space in the center console, and the somewhat thirsty engine coupled with the price of Supreme Unleaded. I was prepared for the fuel economy, so that was not a major problem for me. I add it here as a caution to gas concerned folks. Again for me the major problem is the center console. Otherwise A+++ rating for performance/luxury."
infiniti,g37,2008,G, 05/30/2008,A Thrill of a Ride..WOW,4,"2 weeks and 500 miles later I still have a huge smile on my face each time I drive it. Got the premium pkg with 19"" sport wheels. I now look foward in the mornings to start her up and head to work just for the chance to drive this car. Acceleration is FUN-nominal and this car turns heads ever where I go and each compliment are very positive. There is nothing I would change on this car, its a pleasure to drive everytime. Each time I get out of the car I find myself looking back with a smile wishing I could just keep driving. Test drove the BMW 335i, Acura TL & Lexus IS350 and none had it all wrapped in one beautiful pkg as the G37 did."
infiniti,g37,2008,Beth S, 09/06/2018,Sexy and Peppy,5,"This is not a good car if you need to put anyone in the backseat. Unless they are small, you might have to pry them out with a crowbar. Since it is a 2008, it doesn't have all the safety features the new cars have, but what it does have works great. It's a lot of fun to drive, it hugs the road even in rain, and the front seats are sooooooo comfortable. This is the second one I have owned. I'm going to go for a small SUV next time because I do need more space to haul people and stuff.

Steering not as tight as on previous cars, at 28k miles there was a lot of NOT normal wear on plastics and leather. The built quality inside is on par with Honda Civic. I am sorry, I wanted to like this car, but 335i (thats usually compared to G37S) is just a better car all around."
infiniti,g37,2008,RC, 10/12/2008,Most Handsome Sports Coupe on the Road,4,"The G37s is drop dead gorgeous and a blast to drive. Handling and acceleration are excellent.  I compare the acceleration and handling of the G37 (manual trans) favorably to other cars I've owned in the past (a Mustang GT 06 and BMW 528i 01, both with manual trans).  The G37 comes with all the comfort features and amenities you could possibly want in a luxury coupe, for a third of the price of comparable cars. This car is a keeper for years to come and is destined to become a classic.  "

Got the auto, disappointed infiniti does not have a 6 spd auto  or DSG type transmission.  I would say this is the only issue with the car. The car is responsive, steering is a little light at high speeds.  Controls are easy to use- voice commands in the car are easy.  The interior is good (not as good as an audi).  I would recommend black interior which has white stitching.  The tan or gray interiors look cheaper.  Gas is atrocious but there is cost for the pleasure you get when driving this car.  I am happy overall.  Consider a 335I coupe and M3.  Got the car below invoice. "

I'm a big fan of manual shift gears on cars but the Paddle Shifter is so much fun to use. Especially, I get busy making my calls while I drive most of the time. I just experimented recording with the digital flash card to play music and it sounded awesome. I can't believe we're living the day and age of advanced technoloy today.

You cannot beat the combination of performance, quality,  style and value in a coupe in this price range. I was a little reluctant to buy the ""same"" car again but the new one is an upgrade in almost every aspect. Much nicer interior, controls and features. Nicer to drive on everyday basis. Navi system much better than in my Acura TL. Have not had chance to put car to a test yet but seems to have a little better handling than '04 but acceleration about the same. With more torque, this would be a really great performer. Styling classy but understated."

Since, I love my Z so much, it only made sense to look at an Infiniti G- 37.  I went with the G-37S with the Premium and Sports packages.  I love the Bluetooth connection and stereo system.  I opted not to get the back up camera and Navigation as I've lived just fine for years without them.  I also looked at Lexus, Mercedes and BMW, but I liked the G-37 the most.  After the 350-Z, good handling was a must as was peppiness.  I expect a car to go when I step on it and this car does not disappoint!  It is a fun, responsive car to drive and I love it.

The bimmers seem quicker since the G is such a heavy car. However, the G seems more refined than the M3 which suffered from a loose and clunky differential. The G's differential is much tighter giving an overall smoother & solid feeling. However, the clutch uptake is abrupt (similar to bmw). The navigation of the G is more user friendly, even compared to the iDrive in the newer bmws. It is touch screen and voiced activated. The G37 is a better value since you get more included options rather than having to add them separately like German cars."

It is a real head turner on the road-- I've been stopped by strangers in parking lots and at stoplights who tell me how great looking my car is. Drive is much smoother than my G35 coupe-- quieter too. A real pleasure to drive. I agree with other posters-- don't buy this car and complain about gas mileage.

Excellent build quality and design. I've owned a BMW and a Lexus before. This is the best!  Not a huge fan of the analog clock in place of digital clock. Tilt/push operation for the passenger seat for backseat ingress/egress is overly complicated; every new passenger gets confused about how to tilt the front seat to get in/out of the back seats. "

The looks are great esp. with the 19 inch rims. Ride is comfortable even with sport package. My major concern was seating comfort as I'm 6'5"" and 250lbs.  And let me say this car has more seating room then the Lincoln LS I traded in.  With the wide range of seat adjustments I fit in this car with no issues either from leg room or headroom (with sunroof).  The only minor issue is the seat width is a little narrow for me but not a major inconvenience.  Back seat room is fine for occasional passengers.  My 6'3 brother fit in the back with no problem.  "

This car rides sooo much better, the old car had the sport suspension and all of the bells and whistles as does the G37, I ordered a fully optioned G37 Journey with all of the packages.  I checked the Beemers and was not impressed at all, their dealer experience leaves much desired. Also considered the Subaru WRX Sti, too much $$ for a souped up econobox. I've only put about 3600 miles on her, but every time I take it out I love the car more and more. The remark about the rear seat being cramped is wrong except for maybe head room. Overall fantastic car that looks more exotic and expensive than it really is!"
infiniti,g37,2008,Open Class, 01/08/2008,From 330i to the G37,4,"I have owned a 2001 330i for 4 years and have loved the car.  During my research for a replacement I felt I should look at Infiniti as well as BMW (335 vs. G37).  Both are great cars and if you go by just the professional drivers reviews from the magazines you might lean toward the more expensive BMW (I was).  I drove them both and at the end of the day I felt the ride quality, interior layout, technology, unique exterior, and ""grin factor"" of the G37 to be superior to the 335.  These are the things that matter to me.  In addition, in the real world you will never notice or take advantage of any perceived performance advantages either vehicle might have. So, more vehicle for for 8k less..YES!"
infiniti,g37,2008,tklmn, 01/15/2008,Just Shy of Perfect,4,"Just replaced my 2005 G35 coupe with a 2008 G37S.  Overall, I'm very impressed with the G37 - it's better than the G35 in almost every way including better ride quality, improved sound dampening, tech features (long list of them), interior design... the list goes on and on!   The only changes I could suggest would include eliminating the shifter vibration, like the BMW 3-series.  In my opinion, the vibration goes 180 degrees in the opposite direction of this more refined revision.  Also, the torque seems to be in the mid to high rpms, and I would prefer low end torque.  Unless I punch the gas off the line, it feels like I'm crawling.  The G37 is a great car... just shy of perfect."

It is fast and fun, but still has that ""executive"" feel of a luxury car.  I love that by getting just the Premium Pkg, you essentially get all of the goodies that I wanted and can keep the price of this car around $37K.   There really are only a couple of RWD luxury sport coupes available with a stick under $50K, and this is by far the best deal.  As good as a Bimmer (I drove each several times) for about $10K less."
infiniti,g37,2008,rparamount, 12/30/2009,One of the best in the GT coupe class,5,"The Infiniti G37 is an amazing vehicle. Ever since I saw the original G35 I always wanted one. After the G37 came out I went and bought a 2 door G37 S with all the fixings including the 6 speed manual and navigation. This car is not only fast, but reliable and sexy all at the same time. A car with all of it's features normally sells for thousands of dollars more. Infiniti also made the interior of the car a lot better now and it is up to par with some of the nicer luxury cars out there. Give this car a test drive, you won't be disappointed!"
infiniti,g37,2008,Brian J, 09/14/2010,Fantastic Car,4,I've driven all sorts of sports cars.  I was looking for an all around sports car that would get me through a winter as well.  This car delivers.  It's not going to beat many other sports cars off the line but that mid powerband in the car is wonderful.  Steady constant power all the way through the large band.  One thing I don't particularly like is the clutch seems a bit mushy.  Overall though this is a much sexier car than a 335 by BMW.  With the blend of luxury and performance there really isn't anything out there in this price point that competes with it well.

I test drove the BMW 3, Audi S5, Porsche Cayman and the Vette (go fast, go straight)  they all seem to have one thing in common 46K or better. But the Infiniti with all the bells and whistles to give the car a civilized feel still came in 5K less then the rest.

For me, it came down to the Lexus IS350, BMW 335i & Acura TL-S.  I simply could not justify the extra $$ for the Bimmer considering what the Infiniti offered (great quality, comparable sportiness, for less money).

I don't agree that this car is fast, it's quick, but not fast. If this car can drop 200 lbs and add 35 pounds of torque, it would be in the BMW 335ci class as far as being quicker. Without the torque, I would say this car is a touch behind BMW in the performance area, but it makes up for it by being less expensive and I would say more reliable than the BMW. Infiniti has come a long way since my 2003 G35 coupe. If you are looking for a good looking coupe for around $40k, this car is hard to beat.  "

The sound system and nav are excellent.  High speed (100MPH) on the highway is very well controlled and surprisingly quiet in both road and wind noise.  The power band on this engine does not come alive until you get above 3000 RPM.  Im used to lots of V8 torque, and this otherwise excellent engine just does not have that torque.

The power and sound of the 330 horsepower engine is awsome.  The interior is luxurious and sporty and all of the controls are easy to use and well placed.  Any person looking for a new coupe needs to consider the G37 because I believe you will be pleasently surprised that you will get so much car in this market segment for the price.

Secondly, I still think the seats are too narrow in the front but they are bolstered very well for aggressive corners.

These countless hours led me to the 2009 Infiniti G37, which I bought new in 2009 for $30k (list price of around $35k). I put 155,000 miles on it, with zero problems except for changing the brakes twice, the battery once, and power locks that sometimes didn't want to cooperate. Never got the locks fixed because it wasn't a big deal. I put new tires on twice, and I highly recommend the Michelin Primacy - great in the rain, and last for 60k miles. 

I spent a lot of time looking at various replacement options, but none had the combination of power, handling, interior space, quality, and reliability. So I traded it in last month on a 2013 G37. Just yesterday I had a $40,0000 BMW as a rental, and I was very happy to get back into my car. The used G37 is without question the best value out there.

I was skeptical of the mileage but after a friend of mine had a good experience with a 2003 G35 that reached 182,000 miles and only sold it because he needed an SUV, I decided to purchase it. After all it was a great deal. The dealer I work at took the car in as a trade in and was asking $11,600 for it. Since I work there I got a deal for $10,000! This the best purchase I have ever made! The car is in great condition with nothing damaged or worn. The VQ37VHR is a very powerful motor. In fact it is the same engine from the Nissan 370z. Along with the AWD this sedan hooks up even in the rain with the traction control off. This is a very quick car not to mention a good looking one. I have had no problems with the car at all. The Bose sound system is great and has a nice balance in sound quality. The Bluetooth works flawlessly every time. I am six feet tall and the seating position is great.

Which led me to three options, the bmw 328i x drive, audi a4 and the infiniti g37x. I'm a speed and drive enthusiast, so of course i was leaning towards the bmw. After doing further research and test drives, i was easily able to make a decision. Went with the g37x for its power, luxurious feeling interior and low maintenance cost. The bmw had the smoothest feeling engine and most responsive steering. The audi had the most comfortable drive. But the one that felt just right is the g37. It's the fastest of the three while still feeling well balanced. It's never been in the shop once yet. Completely satisfied with this vehicle. I think my next car will also be an infiniti.

Make sure the light on the clock works if you are purchasing it used... As night fell I noticed the light was out, thought it would be a simple fix... its not... $335.00 to replace the clock.

Had to make a buying decision and wanted a four door, minimum 325 HP and stopped by a dealer a mile from my house and noticed the G37. The first thing I noticed were the subtle muscular lines and posture of the car. When the sales rep started it and the exhaust note perked up my ears.  As I sat in the vehicle and did a quick lookup on the Vehicle specs noted that the car had 328 HP, just 22 less than the Audi, yet 1000 lbs lighter.  I got familiar with the controls then took it and was shocked at the power pulling out of the lot.  Bolted on to the interstate and immediately started realizing that the car was extremely fast, handled extremely well, and hamadryads me smile. Yes, no Quattro drive and not the size of vehicle I truly wanted but I had a cash budget and given the local market didn't turn up an Audi, I went back to the dealer and dumped the cash on his desk and bought the car. Fast forward 8 months and I have ""thugged"" virtually every car who has given me a nod. Mustang GTs, Challengers, Camaros, 535s to name a few. I am now a complete G37 enthusiast and the dual everhead cam V6 is simply badass (and though rated at 330 HP, some legit publications that have tested it state it is closer to 365 HP!!!'   Absolutely love this car

infiniti,g37,2009,eddie100, 05/12/2012,Great so far,4,"Bought my 09 G37x coupe used with 31K mi, very sporty, engine is ferocious, the power doesn't drop off until you hit non-legal speeds. Doesn't have the razor sharp handling of my 06 G35 Coupe, but it's very close and has a smoother, more compliant ride that soaks up bumps very well. Interior with Bose, navigation, and rear view camera is great! I love this car!"
infiniti,g37,2009,HHall, 06/20/2010,Rated the best and is,4,"Set out to buy either a new MB C330, BMW 328, or Lexus IS250.  Did all the research, but the Infiniti was consistently rated highest and was the lowest price so I figured a test drive was warranted. I was sold on the first press of the accelerator.  A terrific car - clearly out performed the others. Excellent in snow and slush - couldn't make it spin out in an empty parking lot.  When priced out with similar options, just a tremendous value for the money compared to the other three.  (Acura was too ugly).  Got 21-22 mph until my speeding ticket, now gets 24-25 commuting."
infiniti,g37,2009,3andg, 02/02/2011,Fun in the Sun,4,"I purchased the G37 Convertible new in November, 2009, and now have ~14k miles on it.
Unlike most hard top convertibles, it looks great top up and top down.
The car is an absolute blast to drive when the weather is sunny and one can take the top down.
With the top up, it is a mediocre performer due to the weight of the retractable top and structural reinforcements.
Creature comforts are great - the ventilated seats, iPod Integration, Bluetooth and Bose Audio System - make the car very liveable on a daily basis.
Due to the styling, there is limited storage space in the trunk and car.
I highly recommend the air deflector for the car - it makes a big difference at highway speeds (70mph+)"

The acceleration is excellent and braking is great too. I drive 55 miles 1 way and seats are comfortable, Im 6 feet 225 pounds. Quality is great as with all infinitis. The rear seats fit my 2 car seats as I have 2 small kids. The AWD is good so far but I thought the g 35 a little better.

I think it's one of the most beautiful cars on the road.
However, there were some major issues that start with cheap materials.
The cheap plastics in the dash and door panels do not befit a car selling for 50 large.
The leather seat material was far less opulent than my Hyundai Genesis, when the doors close you cannot reach the seat adjuster without scratching the aluminum trim on the doors.
Build quality was poor.
Rubber weatherstripping squeezing out from trim, rattles when top up ands zero trunk space with top down.
This is a $30K car with the top chopped off and $23K added to the price.

Great interior (really comfy seats)...has all the bells and whistles you would expect from a $40k car. I am really surprised by the great navi and music hard drive.  Car corners very flat, especially for a sedan and the power is instantaneous. I have noticed an on again/off again rattle in the passenger door after only 3K miles. I have owned every luxury German and Japanese make there is and I must say Infiniti is becoming my favorite due to its blend of near BMW agility, near Lexus comfort, and near Mercedes luxury for typically a lot less than those makes. Good mileage so far too, 22mpg combined."

It looks great with the top up or down.  Considered and drove a BMW 335 Convertible and a Lexus IS 350 Convertible.  Did not like the looks of the Lexus and the BMW was $8000 more WITHOUT a Nav system and other features on the Infiniti.  PLUS the dealership was FRIENDLY and took GREAT care of me.

Had a BMW 328 prior to going to Infiniti the first time and obviously decided to stick with Infiniti.  Maintenance and dealer experiences have been great for the 5 years I've owned my cars.

infiniti,g37,2009,Steve LePard, 03/31/2017,Favorite car ever!,5,"I bought this car off a lot as a stolen recovery with 52k miles and a salvage title, so I got it for a GREAT price.  Never wrecked, nothing whatsoever wrong with it but for a door seal I had to replace.  I love this car, more power than you'll ever need, to the point of breaking the rear tires loose at 75mph on damp pavement when I stepped on it hard to change lanes and the VVT kicked in, YIKES!  You can pass anything at any time, and still get 26-28mpg hwy and 22 around town.  Handling is precise and crisp without being twitchy, and it handles curves on rails, very nice seat bolsters help too.  It rides great, firm, but not uncomfortable at all to my taste.  It's helped by smooth TN roads, up in the pothole, frost freeze northern states I may have another opinion.  Seats and interior are very comfortable for the long haul, with all the usual luxury.  Interior is also very quiet, which I love, not much road noise at all.  Now for a couple minor niggles, the cruise control is not all that accurate going up and down hills, picks up speed going down, then takes 3-5mph drop below set speed to kick back in.  Also the transmission has a pretty big lag between off throttle to back on engagement.  It will scare you the first time you time you slow down and jump back on it to turn in front of someone and it doesn't go!  I've gotten used to it and know how avoid it, so it's no big deal to me now.  The only other small thing missing is a headphone jack interface to play Pandora off my phone.  Bluetooth is only available on the navigation model, and there is a usb connection in the console which works with my IPOD, but I've never been able to figure out how to play Pandora through it.  There's also a hard drive you can copy your CD's onto, so there's really no shortage of music options.  Overall, I've owned a lot of cars in my many years, but this one really suits my style, aggressive when you want to be, comfortable when you don't, but always ready to rip, and just a joy to drive anytime!

infiniti,g37,2009,New Infiniti Fan, 12/03/2008,Move over 3 Series!,4,"I was in the market for an entry level luxury sport sedan for 6 months. All I kept hearing was how great the BMW 3 series was. So I test drove it. While a great performer, the interior felt ""boring"", and the run flat tires were very loud. So I waited a few more months for the G37 to come out. I'm very glad I waited. Infiniti was always trying to catch up to the 3 series in terms of performance and styling, and it seems that they finally caught up. To me, it out performs the BMW, with a much more luxurious interior. Plus it's got more ponies (330 vs 300). Let's not even mention the $10k I saved by going with the G. This is the car for the driving enthusiast that wants the performance and luxury"
infiniti,g37,2009,Robert, 09/03/2009,Best Bang for Buck Sport Sedan,4,"The more I drive my G37S Sedan, the more I love it.  In my opinion, it blows the Mercedes C-Class away, destroys the Audi A4, and is $10,000 less than the BMW 335i comparably equipped.   That said, it is a great combination of utility and performance.  The G37 is fast in a straight line and also a great handling car.  Impressively, it feels much lighter than it actually is.   While the G37 is very capable of good gas mileage, it is incredibly difficult to fight the temptation to hammer the throttle.  Hence, gas mileage can be an issue if you have a lead foot.  In short, bravo Infiniti.  You have created a great mix of performance and luxury for a reasonable cost."
infiniti,g37,2009,Justin, 07/08/2010,Love my 09 37x Coupe!,4,"I've owned my 2009 37x coupe for nine months now so I have a really good feel for what this car can do.  The performance is outstanding and can compete with plenty of other sport coupes on the road in this price bracket.  The transmission complaints are valid in some instances (downshifting in lower gears does jerk the car but I've only ever noticed it going down very steep grades.)  The design speaks for itself and I get a lot of compliments from friends, family and random strangers about the look of it.  Techies will not be disappointed with the electronics in the G as there is plenty to go around.  The bluetooth functionality is excellent.  I think it's roomy and I'm 6'2""."
infiniti,g37,2009,PSA, 06/06/2017,Addendum: Loving my car!,5,"Beautiful 2009 Infiniti G37 convertible, so much fun to drive with top down but had I known that it would require me to fork out over $6400 to have working airbags I would have passed on this car.  Infiniti/Nissan knows that the SRS/OCS are not manufactured to function properly in some vehicles, that is why they have a recall on over 900,000 vehicles yet excluded the 2009 models including mine.  The sensor in the passenger seat is defective on some 2009 G37s and works opposite to how it was intended, it cuts off airbags when a passenger sits on the seat.  I now own a vehicle I do not feel safe in and would never put the lives of my friends and family in danger.  I purchased used less than a year ago after surviving a mva where my 1999 vehicle's airbags helped save my life.  How can I in good conscience sell it to anyone?  This should be a recall from Nissan/Infiniti as they are aware of the seriousness of severe injury or death as a result of manufacturers defect but refuse to fix on 2009.  Also has problem with melting dashboard.  Get a different year Infiniti or pass to a car manufacturer that values human life.  Just wish I had known....

Addendum:  Modern Infiniti of Lake Norman talked to Infiniti USA who came through and replaced defective seat.  I did pay to get car up to date on service first but did not have to pay for seat.   Infiniti definitely cares about the safety of their customers!  Totally changed my mind about owning an Infiniti!

Other cars I considered were the Hyundai Genesis 3.8 Coupe manual transmission but they're rare and too costly. Also considered the MazdaSpeed 3 but eventually narrowed my search to the G37S and wanted a black one. I finally found a 2009 Black on Black and at an Infiniti dealership. It had 68500 miles on it and was just a gem. We had a great experience and were glad we bought from a dealership rather than from a private seller or used car lot. They pampered us and we left with big smiles on our faces. Although we bought the car ""As Is"" they resurfaced the 4 discs and installed new pads all around. I notified them when we got home after buying the car and they took care of us. They also did some engine work for free and we got loaners while she was in the shop. We would never have gotten that level of service from a private seller or used car lot.  No regrets here. Car drives great and we just love it!

That night, I put the top down and up, and noticed that the trunk was opened afterward, so I closed it manually.  The next morning, I approached my car in the garage to find the trunk opened again.  2 days later, the engine refused to go past 10 mph and the Engine Light was on so I was forced to bring it into the dealership.  It's since been over 30 days and Infiniti has tried to solve the problem twice to no avail.  I still don't have my car.  Most of all, I'm wondering where the other bad reviews are? Can anyone say Infiniti Hush Money?  "
infiniti,g37,2009,Mel, 11/15/2018,Avoid This Car,1,"I hate this car. Every day is misery because I made the mistake of buying this car. You'll love it on the test drive. It's fast. It corners like the road is flypaper. You can smoke a Corvette C5 every time. I love a fast car, so why do I hate this one so much? Lets start with the electronics. The traction control is a menace. You have to turn it off or it will rob you of horsepower just when you need it. Not because you're about to lose it, I haven't figured out why it kicks in. The A/C is horrific. I cannot tell you how much I hate the A/C system in this car. It will not blow hot air out of the upper vents. There's nothing wrong with it, it just won't do it. Even on manual control, I can get luke warm air at best. My hands are cold you evil Infiniti engineers, not my feet. My feet have socks. I don't drive in gloves. You pick a temp and it is supposed to keep the car at the temp. It doesn't. It is always blowing super cold A/C at you, it just turns the fan down. This angers me greatly. I'm always freezing in this car.  And good luck getting just fresh air. You have to turn the automatic system off and fool with the darn thing every 2 minutes. And it still tries to blow cold A/C at you. The front seat is a torture device. The seat won't go low to the floor like a seat in a sports car should. It's more like a truck or SUV driving position. I can only drive it for about an hour before my legs are in agony. The finish on the interior is junk. Just junk. The dash cracked. The faux metal accents are junk. They don't clean well and scratch far too easily (as compared to a Lexus).  The power port in the dash went bad. Too scared to try and fix it. Last time I tried to fix something electrical in this car the A/C system decided to not work, at all. (Which was actually preferable.) Mechanically it has been good except for the front hubs went bad at just 100k. If I could undo just one decision I've made in my life, it would be to go back in time and NOT BUY THIS CAR!

The car was awesome for the first 10k miles. However, lately it's just been one issue after another.   I went out to my car this morning and saw rust on the trunk right below the rear spoiler. Yes rust after < 1 year on a car that costs $45k. I couldn't believe it. We'll see how the dealer handles it.  In additions to the rust, the car has developed multiple squeaks from the center console and right dash area. The ipod connector has begun to randomly show my iphone as disconnected even though it's plugged in. The driver's seat is also starting to bubble (common issue)  "
infiniti,g37,2009,Mike P, 12/25/2008,One of the best cars I have driven!,5,"I looked for quite a while before I ordered my G37xS. I was a big 3 letter fan (BMW) but after I drove the 2008 G35, I was sold. I began to read about the improvements that were coming for 2009 and ordered one as early as I could. The AWD Sport is fantastic.  I love the paddle shifters. The car handles very well and it accelerates so smoothly that you barely feel the shifts. The fit and finish are great. I am a big guy and I fit quite comfortably. Everyone talks about the value and I agree, this car is better than every car priced below $65K. The more other cars I drove, the more it made my decision clearer. I have 3,000 miles on it and loved driving every one of them. Fantastic vehicle!"

I also have a 08 911TT Cab so I know cars and power etc. The fit and finish is excellent and the interior is great. Some people criticize the 7speed auto, but honestly, I don't know why and the same goes for the interior. One feature that is cool is the music box with the 9+ GB harddisk. At first I thought it was worthless, but once you have loaded in all your CDs, no more carrying around CDs. If you have to have more status, want to pay thousands more and get less, then by all means buy a Lexus or BMW. The dealer treats you like a king, no begging for loaner."

infiniti,g37,2009,Steve, 01/18/2010,2 many shortcomings?,3,"Got this G37 as a less expensive but highly touted alternative to BMW. Driven it 300 miles. Very strong engine & handling and road feel the equal of any BMW 3 or 5.  Nav system controls are way too busy & confusing.  The show stopper for me is the drivers seat.  Good adjustable lumbar support, but very hard bottom to the point of being painful after 30 mins.  Driver seat adjustments are also difficult to access & didn't help my 6'2"" frame even though the leg room is very adequate.  Good news is that Inifiniti is customer focused & letting me swap the G for the larger M with better seating without penalty.  Thanks Infiniti."
infiniti,g37,2009,jong98, 01/25/2010,Turning Heads,4,"Bought the car just over six months ago and continue to be extremely happy i didn't go with the BMW 335 conv. or the Lexus 3C. The car drives really well, wind feels great with the optional wind deflector, and the sound system is awesome. The Sat Nav is almost perfect and the cooled seats put my friends at awe. The only problem is the body rigidity (average), and the damn seat belts. Its enough of a pet peeve that the retractors don't fully retract the belts when I take them off. Next time Infiniti, make sure the seat belts don't get caught by the door when I get out."
infiniti,g37,2009,RLB, 02/16/2010,Love This Car,4,"What a fun car.  Sexy lines, smooth and powerful. Got Pacific Sky with Stone.  Base, prem, navi, chrome sport package wheels, rear deflector.  Researched for a year, waiting on latest models.  For us the Infiniti beat out the BMW's, Lexus was no comparison, 370Z, and MB.  Also, really wanted a hard top for all weather and noise reduction.  Have had trouble with the seat belts getting caught by the door but unbuckled them from the leather strap on the seat to let them retrac all the way.  Pain reaching back for it but better.  Planning a 2k mile trip first of Spring, can't wait to pop the top and go."
infiniti,g37,2009,Bobby, 05/15/2010,Great Car - Poor Transmission,4,"Replaced my G35 with a 37, but I wish I had my 35 back.  Pretty much the same car inside the cab, but obviously faster and with a terrible 7 speed transmission.  The jerks at low speeds during shifts and jumps into higher gears is frustrating.  Takes the fun out of driving an otherwise awesome car."

infiniti,g37,2009,Antonio246, 09/23/2010,Germans do it better,2,"I am at 5800 miles on my G and can't wait to get rid of it. Worst transmission I've ever driven.  The car lurches forward on downshifts, sometimes it hesitates rendering manual and DS positions useless. Even passengers notice the sloppy shift pattern in automatic. When I took it back to the dealer to repair the tranny he told me ""it's the way it's supposed to shift. You're not driving a Lexus"". Hmm. Do yourself a favor and get a German car or hey, how about a Lexus?"
infiniti,g37,2009,iwasgointo, 10/11/2009,Not For City Slickers,4,"Great car overall, but the clutch pedal is a bit too heavy for regular city stop and go driving. I live in Philly and all Infiniti dealers are located in the suburbs. The suburban test drive and the back roads that showed off the handling really didn't reveal how tiring the clutch pedal would become in the city environment where I reside. I have a 2006 Honda Element with manual trans that is a pleasure to drive in the city with its light clutch and precise shift action. It's very, very similar to the BMW 3 Series that I recently test drove. If I could have driven the Infiniti in the city for a day or two I probably would not have purchased it despite its other wonderful virtues."
infiniti,g37,2009,Triathlongator, 12/30/2009,Smooth Ride,4,"Smooth, powerful ride. Definitely a lot of car for a great price.  With other comparisons such as the Audi S4 with a very similar engine, it's a great choice and handles great in the snow with AWD."
infiniti,g37,2009,Don, 04/30/2010,"Great car, Poor dealership",4,"Purchased the preowned G37 from Infiniti of Gwinnett (Atlanta).  The car is amazing, the dealership stinks. Very deceitful!"
infiniti,g37,2009,Me, 02/26/2010,Fuel Consumption Terrible,3,"I have had the car for 1 Week. Fuel consumption is not good at all. I am looking at around 12 miles to the Gallon, have driven 120 miles and used 10 Gallons, this includes a majority of hwy 90 % and 10 % city, my Chevy Tahoe gave me 400+ to a full 20 gallon Gas Tank. I was told that it would give me 17 city and 24 Hwy. It is such an expensive car and I will definitely not buy an infinity again. Very displeased. The car is definitely not worth the money, not much to celebrate for the price payed"
infiniti,g37,2009,bpc4me, 10/21/2009,G37 sedan with premium package,4,"Overall a great car. This is my second Infiniti, first being the g35. This is a big step forward. The car is beautiful both in and out. Very comfortable and fun to drive. I looked at this as well as the BMW 335i and walked away with this car mostly based on price. Being nit picky, I will say that the car needs just a little more refinement in the brakes and engine department. The brakes are very touchy. not too smooth. The engine is great but you feel the shifts too much. There is also a good 2 to 2.5 second delay between pedal mash and power to the wheels at highway speed."
infiniti,g37,2009,Colonel35, 07/15/2009,Best in class,4,"I cross-shopped the 328i (xDrive), TL-SHAWD, A4 2.0, and IS-250AWD.  None of them came close to offering the same blend of performance, handling, features, technology, and usability as the G37xS.  The engine is extremely powerful (pulling away with four passengers up a hill is still easy to elicit a ""Whoa"" from everyone on board), the chassis handling BMW-like (read: near-perfect), the technologies (voice control, music box, swiveling headlights, laser cruise, traffic gps, etc. etc.) both cool and easy-to-use, the seats bolster you in like some high-luxe sport cars, and the overall experience is extremely satisfying and fun."
infiniti,g37,2009,Antonio246, 04/24/2010,Nice cruiser but terrible transmission,5,"I traded an '06 Passat for my G three months ago. So far really like the car except for a couple of complaints. The transmission jolts the car when shifting gears most of the time and the quick shift is useless.  Hesitates when changing gears and then it's like it can't decide which gear to settle into when downshifting.  Very annoying and disappointing.  Also, cruise control revs the engine suddenly when using the accelerate feature. Personally don't care about the poor gas mileage.  It's not that bad and I wasn't expecting too much with this much power."
infiniti,g37,2009,Jordan Griffin, 12/15/2018,The X coupe rocks!,4,"I’ve owned this car for a little over 6 months, and so far it’s been an amazing car. The power is phenomenal, it is above its weight class considering it’s closest competitor is the BMW 335i, which it does a great job of keeping up with and it’s 10x more reliable (believe me, BMWs aren’t reliable. That’s the reason i needed a new car). You have to remember that these are Nissan engines, they’re basically bulletproof. The style, some people don’t like the design of the grill and the entire front end. I actually really like it, i think that it exudes performance and professionalism. Yes it will whoop up on most cars that try to race it at a stop light, but your boss won’t be pissed off when he has to ride with you to lunch one day. The interior is comfortable, really snug in the back but that’s to be expected with a sports coupe. The big bulky seats in the front are really comfortable and the drivers side has a great driving position. Storage is kinda few and far between, not many nooks and crannies. While the rear seats do fold down, the tunnel is still pretty small. The trunk is really shallow, and not great for storing many groceries. Some things I would change about the car are; Bluetooth (I have an ‘09, I believe they added it shortly after), with 7 gears (I have an auto :(...) it revs really high and is very hard to “carefull”. It is very peppy and it will let you know it.... it’s also quiet heavy, so it’s not quite as nimble as a small bmw.- furthermore, I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a lower priced, fast, reliable coupe.

infiniti,g37,2009,My First Infiniti, 12/26/2008,G37xS Missing Buttons,4,I had been looking for cars for quite a while and was really looking forward to the new A4 after test driving almost everything.  This new G37 may not look like it but it is a great evolution of the G35  Last spring I rented a G35 while on vacation but felt that my B5 S4 was superior after the rental.  The gas pedal was very touchy and the transmission had a mind of it's own. This G37xS feels so solid that it's hard to believe it's based on the same car that I drove 8 months ago.  Anyone considering a BMW should take a G37 for a test drive and try to deny the primal thrill that this V6 delivers at redline.  You should buy this car because it sounds so much better than it's competition.
infiniti,g37,2009,Brian H., 03/11/2009,The King is buried and gone!!,5,"I have owned many vehicles including the KING of performance, the ULTIMATE DRIVING MACHINE and yes the Bimmers are a blast to drive they just lack all of the other stuff you would expect when you are purchasing a luxury vehicle. Simply the Infiniti G37 gives you the performance of the Bimmer but for a whole lot less and ten times more technology and features you cannot even get on the BMW. I know, I know, people always say if you can afford a BMW then money really is not an issue but in this day and age $10k is still $10k. Unless you must have those three letters in your driveway, get the Infiniti G37xS and if you want to blow $10k buy some GM stock."
infiniti,g37,2009,sysadb420, 03/27/2009,One of a Kind,4,"This car surprised me. I stopped in to test the G and the M35 as well, but was shocked by the superior handling of the G. I drove the 328, A4 and CTS, but this was superior, especially considering it's the stock setup. Only 500 miles so I haven't tested everything in the NAV pkg yet. Quality construction, handling, steering, quietness, styling and power come for a competition-beating price and make this car a winner. Fuel mileage looks grim, but we'll see after more tanks."

This car is much sportier, has 48 more horses than the M, and is a blast to drive.  The steering is much tighter and with the all-wheel drive it sticks to the road in dry, rainy, or snowy weather.  The sport model comes with the paddle shifters and 18"" alloy wheels.  Very nice look in the new Moonlight White color.    "
infiniti,g37,2009,newinfinitiowner, 04/11/2009,Love this car,4,"Test drove an Audi A4, Acura TL, BMW 328 and Lexus ES 350.  I found the G37x the best combination of performance, comfort and value.  This car is fun to drive.  I've owned it for a couple of months now, and I still look forward to driving it.  I couldn't decide if I should upgrade to the high tech package, but I am very happy I did.  The high tech package adds to the overall enjoyment of driving this car.  After reading about how poor the fuel efficiency is, I was not expecting much.  While it's certainly not great, its not that bad.  Unless your expectations are for something that would cost tens of thousands more, you will not be disappointed with this car."

I actually thought the Ininiti G and the Lexus IS were too small. One day while waiting to test drive a pre-owned M the sales rep suggested I test drive a new G. I did and it was love at first drive. It is one of the most solid cars I have ever driven, has plenty of power and all of the controls for the Nav, sound system, phone, etc are extremely easy to use. Once you get to use the controls a short time you can figure out how to use all of the functions without referring to an instruction booklet. This car is more than a 3 series and much cheaper!"
infiniti,g37,2009,AJ, 04/17/2009,2009 G37xS Top Choice,4,"This is my first all-wheel drive car.  In the past I was a rear-drive enthusiast - I've owned 3 BMW's and most recently a 2003 Infiniti G35S.  The ride is top quality and the car is one of the best I have driven.  I was initially concerned that the weight of the AWD would hurt the handling and acceleration.  The impact is really minimal vs. the S version, but I live in the snow belt.  Even on an icy road, it's very hard to spin the wheels - great traction! I was also concerned that the sport seats would be a bit tight, but after driving for a few days, I was convinced that they are an excellent choice (unless you are over 210 lbs.).  Overall, I am very pleased."
infiniti,g37,2009,GMan, 04/27/2009,Everything and more..,4,"Have had this car about a month with 1800 miles on it and I love it. It's the best of both worlds, you can just cruise or drive it hard and it responds flawlessly no matter what! The 7AT helps with the gas mileage and is fun to drive in the manual mode! Coming from a Maxima I expect the same reliability as well."

The controls for bluetooth, nav, climate and audio features are intuitive and easy to use. The backup camera is fantastic. Gas mileage is not great, but it's a heavy car with 328 hp so that's to be expected. Very solid construction and well executed interior. "

I just traded up from a 323i, and although that's an older/lower end car, I do have to say the performance:luxury ratio is far more skewed towards power in the case of the G37. That said, I find it to be a very comfortable, stylish ride, FUN to drive (strong emphasis there), and (especially living in CA), a beautiful, unique, stand-out car. ""Bang for the buck"" doesn't begin to describe it. Given the choice between a G37 and 335i, I'd still take the G. Implied note: Audi/Mercedes/Lexus -- no comparison. "
infiniti,g37,2009,TommyC3, 05/03/2009,G37X Sedan,4,"The car has a real nice ride to it and so far I'm very happy with my purchase.  I haven't had it that long to really comment on the mpg but so far it's about as advertised.  I only have 2 complaints about the car, 1) when you take your foot off the gas and the car begins to slow down it has a rough downshift from 3rd to 2nd.  Not something you'd expect from an auto.  2) the brake pads give off way too much brake dust."
infiniti,g37,2009,RodsterinFL, 05/20/2009,Final Decision - '09 G37 Journey Sedan,5,I shopped for some time comparing cars-planned on a BMW but the $9000 diff was too much to contend with. The character of the car is amazing. It's a rocket when you want it or a quiet cruiser. Went to the dealer for a coupe came out with a sedan with no regrets. The engine is the MOST responsive I have owned- quick revving. The transmission is great. I have noticed that it does well in just about every situation except for quick stops - can't shift down fast enough I guess. Otherwise it has aggressive shifting pattern that I prefer - smooth and determined. Personally I think the car is under rated always compared to BMW when $ and reliability really make it the better choice. Biased reviews?
infiniti,g37,2009,dave, 06/05/2009,2009 G37 X Review,4,"I test drove TL S-AWD, BMW 335 X drive, and G37 X.  BMW 335 gave me the best driving experience in terms of acceleration, handling, brakes, and comfort.  G37 was good too but not as good as BMW.  I bought the G37 because I got 6 grand off MSRP and it's roomier inside.  I'm sure it's a lot more reliable than BMW."

I had a hard time choosing between the 3 series and the G37 but my wife made the decision easy because she preferred the G37 interior.  The navigation and premium package was a must and because we hadn't bought a new car recently, the blue tooth and backup camera were nice features.  What got us to the dealership though was predicted RELIABILITY and we chose Infiniti based on my wife's positive experience with Nissan."

I forgot to mention I saved at least 100 in lease price compared to 4 cylinder audi, and also way more than 100 for a 335 bmw. The interior is amazing, the drive is comfortable and the power is insane. The AWD is incredible you can do 70 mph off the highway without hearing a thing.It's just an incredible machine.G37 4ever."

The G37x gives me best value and comfort and I can always count on the Infiniti quality. I based my final decision on a combination of these factors - performance, comfort/toys, fun to drive, value and reliability."
infiniti,g37,2009,DL, 07/02/2009,Excellent value,4,"I initially wanted a CTS.  The G37x for me was the best value, has excellent expected reliability (3rd year in production also tends to work out some early-production bugs), and leaves the other cars in the dust when it comes to acceleration.  My numerical ratings may have been overly harsh, but when you look at its competitors (not considering price), the G37x is a bit rough around the edges."

When I went back to the Infiniti dealership to check out an '09 FX, the new version just didn't whet my appetite. Too exotic maybe. I test drove a G37X and wow! Now that's a sports sedan! I gave up some storage and SUV driving height, but came away with a rocket ship on wheels, that is as tight as a drum. I had test driven a BMW 328X also and this car is as tight as that but with ample more power. The 328 is not even in the same class power wise."

Although I bought the car this May, I test drove it during a Michigan snow storm, and have a strong impression of its road grip-handling during both good and very poor road conditions. This car is superb by all measures. It's exterior lines are eye catching and interior refinements are topnotch. Fuel economy is better than I had anticipated, as I'm averaging 21 MPG of mostly city driving. Not too shabby! This car is awesome. "

Recently got 31.2 mpg with cruise set at 58 mpg on eastern shore of MD!  Handling is great without S trim - no need to upgrade unless you really want a bit more performance for the extra $.

I decided on the g37x coupe based on the reliability and performance factor of my previously owned Infiniti FX 35.  My FX never, and I mean never, went back to the dealership.  I had the oil changed every 3,000 miles at my local service station.  I test drove the BMW 335x and could not justify spending the difference in price for a comparable car.  The g37 coupe is comfortable, handles well and has insane acceleration.  The standard feature list far surpasses any of its competitors from Germany.  I would definitely buy it again."

Eventually I went for G37. After driving 1500 miles, I'm glad I made a right decision. This is an incredible driving machine with tons of power under hood. The curb turning is really great and better than 328i. I feel so thrilled whenever I do 0-60mile acceleration. This is the best entry luxury sports sedan by far. "

This engine is more powerful and more refined.  The power band is excellent, and power is always ready.  I love being in 7th gear, and doing 2600 rpm at 80mph - averaging over 29MPG.  The cabin is quieter over the G35, and feels roomier.  My sun shade from the G35 fits on the G37, BONUS!! I was looking at the ISF, C63, G8 GXP, and 330.  I wanted a sporty sedan that wasn't too big. The e55 would have been too big.  The G37 gave me everything I wanted, at a wonderful price."

I have nothing against the BMW's but I personally felt that this Infiniti responded better than the 3 series.  I honestly have no complaints at all.  I heard someone say that the display was hard to see but I don't get that at all.  I think the cabin is well designed.

I got the Premium and Navi which are a must have for a lux car.  Way better than BMW 3 series and more stylish than the TL.  Old G series was boring, but I love the new design, 7 speed AT, and 328 HP!  Interior is great and comfortable (BMW interior is boring -- leatherette for a lux car?  Are you kidding me?) TL is bigger but not as fast and not as pretty on the outside.  I thought about getting a Maxima, but heck, it's almost the same price, so why not get the G37?  With the confidence of Inifinti reliability, I am one happy camper."

This car has got the most powerful standard engine in its class and it makes it such an amazing machine to drive. 0-60 in a little over 5 seconds. Gotta love it!  At the same time, the brakes make stopping feel effortless so that you're confident driving such a strong car.  Lastly, the interior is beautiful and classy.

infiniti,g37,2009,imissmyG35, 08/24/2009,What happened Infiniti??,2,"Having driven a 2006 G35 coupe for the past 3+ years, I thought the new G37 coupe was an obvious choice when looking for a new car.  I would get the driving experience I LOVED from the old car and more gadgets and features than an electronics show in Vegas.  I was sorely mistaken.  The transmission in this car searches for gears like Indiana looking for the Holy Grail.  The steering is so loose that any imperfection in the pavement sends it all over the road.  Driving it is a maddening endeavor; I feel like I am always trying not to break it or push it over the edge!!!  I have called the dealer and while they assure me this is normal operation, I have an appointment for Friday.  "
infiniti,g37,2009,mdkatie23, 08/22/2009,On Cloud 9! LOVE THIS CAR!!!,4,"Like other posters, I researched/test drove so many vehicles before finally taking the plunge on the G. None could compare to Infiniti's styling, comfort, power, technology, and VALUE! I had to have the premium package and navi. The navigation system in this car is awesome---one of the best on the market. The toys on the inside--- bluetooth, ipod connector, back up camera really appeal to my techie side. The jump from 0-60 will make your heart flutter. The interior leather is supple and the car is simply striking on the road. Be prepared---people will stare! I just cannot say enough about this car. Infiniti---keep doing what you're doing. Customer for life!"
infiniti,g37,2009,msshahied, 08/27/2009,Ultimate Driving Experience,4,"Doesn't get any better than this.  Coming from a Ford Explorer to an Infiniti is like eating spam for 4 years and then moving up to caviar!  I checked out the Mercedes C Class, the Acura TL, Lexus IS and BMW 3 Series and none of them comparable to what my Infiniti is.  The handling is great, it's F-A-S-T for a sedan and has everything I need.  Other people complained that the doors not locking automatically but mine do so maybe it's just the Journey model that does so.  If I could change anything, I would have gotten the model with all the bells and whistles (Nav, Bluetooth, etc.) but again, I was coming from an Explorer lol."
infiniti,g37,2009,Hermitt, 08/28/2009,Best car in its class,5,"I was in the market for a sport sedan for 6 month. I compared the A4, IS350,335XI. For my preference none of these cars compared to the G overall package. Is rough edgy but with class, great all wheel drive system. I love it."
infiniti,g37,2009,ViliV, 09/04/2009,G37S Journey coupe,4,"The handling and performance is superb, acceleration is great under any circumstance. The technology loaded in this vehicle really makes the difference with comparable 335 or A5, a fully loaded G37 coupe would cost around 8-10K less than any other European brand. "
infiniti,g37,2009,Ann, 09/09/2009,Love the Car--Hate the Cupholders,4,"I have had my convertible for over a month.  I have been waiting for it since Feb.  I LOVE everything about it, except the cuphold situation-- or more accurately, the lack of good cupholders.  I ordered the manual version and test drove the automatic.  Different cupholders!  Also, my average gas mileage is about 17.1 mpg.  I would love to get the advertised 19-21mpg. I'm still learning all the features to the car, but I am totally enjoying the navigation system and phone/iPod connection.  Also, the speakers in the headrest is the best. I will say that the Lexus has more trunk space with the top down than the Infiniti.  I only have room for an umbrella and a baseball hat in the trunk."
infiniti,g37,2009,Joe H, 09/10/2009,G 37x Coupe A Perfect 10,5,"I bought a BMW 328XI coupe a few months ago in error and now made the change to the G37X.  Though the mistake cost me, it was well worth it. The difference between the two cars and the value you get with the G37 made the change something that I had to do. Though the 328XI is a fine car, it does not have the road manners of the G37X.  I have always wanted the G37X and I waited for the AWD to become available in the coupe. This car is a monster on the road,  the ride is perfectly smooth, the quality of the ride is perfect and the performance is impeccable. Infiniti is number one with me."
infiniti,g37,2009,Rowdy Yates, 09/17/2009,What a tremendous vehicle!,4,"Moonlight White G37S with Premium/Navigation/Sport/Technology/4- wheel Active Steering packages  Just brought this home. I had been shopping around since February. Looked at the BMW 335, Audi A4, Mercedes C300, Lexus IS350/ES350, Volkswagen Passat and CC. After all was said and done, the bang for the buck was clearly with the 09 G37.  The most impressive part of the car's performance isn't necessarily the 0-60 time (although it is nice). I find that its ability to get up and go when already at highway speeds to get around slower traffic and put safe distance between you and others has to be experienced to be fully appreciated."
infiniti,g37,2009,Kenny M, 09/24/2009,I'm Picky & I'm Impressed,4,"Turned in my FX45 on this new G37xS.  It is stunning.  The driving experience is pretty incredible.  The comfort is quite good, the features are very complete, the size and packaging are good, and the electronics are excellent.  As you would expect, the performance envelope is outstanding.  Excellent power throughout the rev range.  Brakes are strong and easy to modulate.  Handling is responsive and sporting without being at all punishing.  After 2 months and about 4000 miles I love this car.  My G is fully optioned and very comfortable.  Not a single item on the punchlist for the dealer.  Everything works as it should and fits properly.  My MPG to date is about 19, but my foot is heavy."
infiniti,g37,2009,mince, 09/21/2009,Great driving experience,4,"I am the proud owner of this 2009 G37 and so far I love it.  I try to find excuses to go somewhere just so I can drive it.  This car is FAST.  I have to be careful so I don't get a ticket.  I usually keep it in ""D"" mode to tame the horses and for better fuel economy.  I average about 22mpg in city driving. The navigation and premium packages were well worth the upgrade.  This car is just a dream to drive."

The 09 has a bit more acceleration, better hwy MPG and the deals they're offering it's the best bang for the buck in performance sedans right now. The 7 spd Auto in the 09 (compared to the 5 spd in the 07-08) really helps w/ fuel economy. I've already noticed a 2mpg increase on the hwy and the motor isn't really broken in yet. The 7 spd tends to hunt a bit more for gears in speeds under 30 mph but I know there's a Tech service bulletin to have a trans reflash to smooth the shifts, so that'll be taken care of. "
infiniti,g37,2009,Irondog168, 10/06/2009,What a car,4,"Just got this car yesterday for 4k under invoice price, what a steal! It's a nice car and well balanced with sport and luxury. Dream car and only 20 dollars more for insurance from accord coupe to G37. Buy it and you won't regret!! I love it and I would just sit in there for like hours and smile like stupid."
infiniti,g37,2009,Abujamil, 10/12/2009,Good but not the Best,3,"My first time I have Inifiniti G37 Coupe, it was fun to drive... a good horse power, but it's for sure not a gas friendly car, I have seen avg 14Mpg to max 20 Mpg, and the sport model type have a noisy tires until you get used to it. Small seats, it's made for big people. It has a good features. I'm enjoying it but I won't buy it again if I was asked to buy it."
infiniti,g37,2009,Paull12, 10/11/2009,What a great car!,5,"Just got my G37 w/Premium, Nav packages and love it! Fun to drive, looks great, fit and finish are outstanding. Couldn't ask for a better value. I am looking forward to many years of driving fun with this great car."

Under $50 there is no better car... the TCS and AWD make for a great combo. The ride is stiff but comfortable. The interior is warm and inviting but has a ""fighter jet cockpit"". I hate Bose (Clarion) technology, however this OEM system is not bad."
infiniti,g37,2009,Eric, 11/02/2009,They continue to impress and amaze me,5,"I've driven Infiniti's since 1993.  16 years of nothing but good things to say.  The G37X is as good as it gets.  Splurge for the Navigation - the other goodies that come with it make it a bargain.  If the economy was better, these would be selling like hotcakes - there would be a waiting list.  Check out the reviews, Car and Driver, Consumer Reports, etc.  It is a no brainer and nothing touches it bang for the buck - the perfect car if you want performance and technology with a side of practicality.  "
infiniti,g37,2009,j graham, 11/05/2009,My second sport model G,4,"Just took delivery today of an '09 white G37S to replace my 07 G35s. These are the first automatics I've ever owned, and I was so impressed I skipped the 6MT option.   I had the Tech/Nav/Sport options on the 07, and insisted on them for the new car, which made it very difficult to locate, but the adaptive lighting and dynamic cruise are so helpful I could not imagine having a car without them.  I test-drove Audi, BMW, Acuras and even used Boxsters to try finding anything better than the old G, but was unable to fall in love with anything  else.  The white is much better looking than the old Lakeshore slate G35S, plus the improved performance - what is not to like?  "
infiniti,g37,2009,VRod, 11/22/2009,My 1st G,4,"This car overall is a great car for its class and price. It's fun to drive. great acceleration, Braking is very good, can be touchy at first but one gets used to it. I had the car for 9 months and put on 30,000 miles my gas mileage averages at 23 mph combo city/highway and I have gotten 26 mph straight highway. I have gotten as low as 10 mph, but then again this is a 330 hp car with AWD and that's what happens when you go full throttle of the line. Gas mileage for this car considering the weight, power, and the AWD, is very good and as expected. If buying this car for fuel economy then you are looking at the wrong car. If you're looking for some driving fun, then this is the car."
infiniti,g37,2009,InfinityzeN, 12/03/2009,"G37 Coupe with Premium, Sport, Nav, Tech",4,"I test drove 11 different vehicles from 9 different manufactures, finally selecting the G37 for its overall combination of price, performance, looks, and overall sexiness.  Reaction to the car is a mixed bag from men.  However every woman who has come into contact with mine has loved it, some enough to walk up to me in the store and rave about it.  When you decide to get on it hard, the rear end breaks free a little sooner then you would expect, but in a very controllable and forgiving manner.  This makes it very easy to drive fast, pushing it until the back end starts to drift out and hold the line.  From someone who normally despises automatics, the seven- speed in the G37 is phenomenal."
infiniti,g37,2009,James C Guess, 11/30/2009,Excellent workmanship. Poor engineering.,3,"Excellent workmanship. Poor engineering. Loud engine and road noises. Bad reflection of dash to windshield from sun and dash lights. Must take vehicle to dealer to check transmission fluid. Vehicle does not track well on straightaway road and requires constant steering. At 70 mph, tach rpm is 2300 whereas, it should be less than 2000 for better mileage. Previous owned Acura TL, type S, a superior vehicle to this one.       "
infiniti,g37,2009,happyG37Sowner, 12/08/2009,Having some fun!,5,"Have been driving my G37S for 2 months - still putting a smile on my face!  Acceleration with the manual transmission is a hoot, and sport suspension / handling is fabulous.  Looked at the BMW 335, and besides the fact that there wasn't a single non- black manual transmission to be found ANYWHERE, and the fact that the same features would be $10k more, and the fact that it doesn't have that awesome Bose sound system, the G37 Sport 6 speed was still my favorite.  Even fit the kids in the back, so it's practical, too (ok, I'm a roadster convert, so it's all relative). I LOVE this car!"
infiniti,g37,2009,mflo, 12/07/2009,G37 x sedan premium and nav package,5,"This car is amazing. I test drove the mercedes benz c300, bmw 3 series, lexus is250 and of course infiniti g37.

infiniti,g37,2009,maynard_marc, 12/16/2009,G37X Will Not Disappoint,4,"Just took delivery on an 09 blue slate off the lot and drove it home last week. What a machine. I traded in an 04 Honda Accord V6 for this and could not be happier. Still waiting to see how the mileage shakes out, but I really do not anticipate a car like this getting 25 MPG, more like 20-22. I was worried about the back seat being too small for my family.  I have two young boys, only one in a booster seat and there is room for both of them and an adult if need be. This would not be practical for the main family car, but it is a great second car and one that will turn heads."
infiniti,g37,2009,SAM, 12/29/2009,Awesome,5,"I'm a hardcore sports car driver/fan. I take the G37 to the back canyons every weekend, and this car never disappoints. This car comes to life to its famed character beyond 50MPH, where its 330 horsepower shines. Not blazingly fast off the line, due to relatively low torque figures and rather substantial weight; off-the-line is fast but not heroic (i.e. will be beaten by the 335 off-the-line but can catch up as speed picks up. Stock/non-sports-package brake setup's rotor is prone to warping, but braking performance is excellent.  Overall GREAT car. Not a single day I regret my purchase. "
infiniti,g37,2009,G37ster, 12/30/2009,Great Sports Sedan,4,"A great blend of sporty and luxury, with an emphasis on sporty.  It is such a pleasure to drive, I'm always anxious to drive it.  The ride is firm but it handles and accelerates with the best of them.  It's a monster car in civilized clothing, very understated, which I like. I used to want a 3 series but now, not as much.  The reliability and value makes it favorable. The brakes are a little touchy but I got used to it.  The exterior style is nice, clean.  If Infiniti maintains its performance, quality and reliability while keeping prices reasonable (MSRP is high) with this car, then they probably have long time customer."
infiniti,g37,2009,Spike1, 01/28/2010,Not overly impressed for the $$$$,4,"Plenty enough power which probably accounts for the less than average advertised fuel economy. I'm averaging just about 20mph city&highway without really pushing it. If you're planning on driving it (mine is the x version),in the snow I wouldn't recommend doing it with the factory Dunlop so-called all season tires. They are useless in the snow, and defeat the purpose of the new all wheel drive system. I replaced mine with the new Continental Extreme DWS's, and WOW...what a difference. Unless my car is an exception, be aware that there seems to be a noticeable lag when shifting from the auto to manual mode. Otherwise, for the most part, relatively satisfied so far after 3,000 miles. "
infiniti,g37,2009,rt-texas, 02/05/2010,The wife loves it,4,Replaced the spouses Audi TT with a G37 because so many friends recommended Infiniti. If it's as reliable as I hope I will be ecstatic.  Wife is now thrilled with the car. I love the combination of sport performance with a touch of luxury. 
infiniti,g37,2009,Amy, 02/24/2010,Want my '04 G35 Coupe back!,3,"Replaced my '04 G35 coupe w/Sport suspension with '09 same pkgs. Just wanted updated electronics. What I loved best about the '04: tight steering, throaty feel and great brakes. Infiniti ruined all three. The steering is loose, the 7 spd transmission spends all its time at high rpm's shifting all over the place - like an old 4 cylinder piece of junk and the brakes grind. After 2 weeks and 900 miles, I guess I only have a few more years to hate it. Maybe I can still buy back my '04."
infiniti,g37,2009,Super car, 03/04/2010,Excellent Coupe,4,Super power comes with AWD. Interior design is excellent. Electronic gadgets are nice to have. This car has a strong engine with all the luxury comfort. It is an excellent coupe that combines both. It is not harsh on the road as BMW. The torque is not there as the 3.35i but still has plenty of power to make you smile.
infiniti,g37,2009,BVan, 03/15/2010,G37X If you commute and want a fun ride,4,If you commute more than 40-miles a day you will love this car.  The all wheel drive is great in the winter and because 60% of the power is provided to the real wheels the car still handles very well like a performance car.  The 7 speed transmission with the ability kick into sport mode is exhilarating.  The 330-hp really performs with this well synchronized power train. The only down side is that I got a speeding ticket my first month because the car runs so smooth and has exceptional power that you need to watch the acceleration or get ready to shell out some green stamps to the police.  The sound system and the instrumentation feel natural.  Small middle armrest compartment is a drag.
infiniti,g37,2009,Agb, 03/05/2010,Bye bye BMW,4,"I've owned BMW 5 series for 17 years. This year I decided to downsize so I looked at a 335. Great car. Then I drove a G37. To be honest I would have preferred to buy the BMW, but it would have cost about $10,000 more than a comparably equipped G37. BMW nickle and dimes you to death on options, and there's no way it's $10,000 better than a G37. I perfectly satisfied with the G37, and $10,000 wealthier."
infiniti,g37,2009,yc, 03/20/2010,A super smooth ride,5,"I bought this car after having a Honda Accord for a year. What a difference. Aside from the styling, which is beautiful, this car IS power. And at 75 mph, the ride is as smooth as it is at 25. I love the car! Cup holders could be bigger - larger cups don't fit -  especially alongside a breakfast sandwich. A minor concession."
infiniti,g37,2009,fastaslast, 03/23/2010,Almost the totalpackage,4,"The car while stiffly sprung rides nice, tight, and sticks to the road. Accelerates hard w/ trans in SM mode. Full auto is slow to downshift and 2 door coupe x model HAS NO PADDLE SHIFTERS - why? Voice system is poor - 40 commands - my wife's Honda understands 600!! Sound system above average. Controls feel expensive, great interior, a drivers car. Great sounding when you hit the gas and I like the downshift matching in Sport mode. I have the adaptive cruise control which means you have to adapt to it. It slows down - sometimes hard in traffic so it takes getting used to if you are a cruise control person. Trunk/back seats are for looks not for use beyond soft luggage and 2 walker golf bags."

infiniti,g37,2009,GK, 04/13/2010,"Fun to drive, but needs improvements",4,"Great sports sedan, powerful & responsive. AWD performed amicably during the latest snowstorm. All electronic features are very intuitive, and well designed.  However, there are some drawbacks: 1) poor mileage when driven mostly in the city. I get 14 mpg on average. 2) small trunk with narrow opening 3) rear seats don't fold down. In overall, I'm happy with the car, but really miss my FX35."

The creature comforts are great. It also looks stunning.  If you look at other hard top convertibles, no other make comes close to making the hard top look like the coupe the way Infiniti does.  All around awesome car."
infiniti,g37,2009,MontereyST3, 11/18/2010,It had to grow on me,4,"I spend a lot of time in the car and after driving a Matrix it was quite an adjustment.  It's not as nimble as the Matrix but excels on the highway which was what I needed. Road noise could be less over poor roads but good roads its very quiet.  I'll try softer tires next and that may help.  The car is really much more of a sports car than a sedan.  Cabin is tight but once adjusted it seems normal.  I like the simplicity of the interior. Everything else I looked at was very busy inside with buttons everywhere. I don't need a decoder manual to operate the climate controls. The ride is smooth and at 5 pm when I have four more hours of driving to go before I get home, its worth the money."

I feel like I can do most anything I desire driving wise.  2010 pricing was great.  Compared it to BMW 3 series. Like the ride and drive of both, but the Bimmer's plain interior and circa-1980 orange dash lighting was bland and uninspiring.  The G37 on the other hand is simply cool. Head turns from all who see it. Dash lighting is beautiful.  Many options to play with on all accessories.  Drive is smooth and compliant. Steering, sensational. The Edmunds model review is right on the mark.    "

There are a lot of rattle noises when you drive with the top up. 2. They have a ""special filter"" on the a/c that doesn't manage to filter out bad air just create a nice moldy smell in the interior. 3. Their service and warranty department is the pits.  Even when there's an issue, like with the a/c filter, they won't fix it properly and they make you think you're crazy.  I took this up to the regional level and they simply don't care.  Overall, its a nice car but I'd never buy another Infiniti because of their service and warranty department."

Looked at the Audi A5 but it did not have a hard top so it was out. The BMW was a nice handling car but lacked the Audio System that the G37 had and I could not see the BMW as a car worth $9500 more then the G37 convertible. The Lexus IS350 to me looked more like a standard boxy convertible but it did have some nice luxury features but with the price same as the G37 the G37 won me over on the styling, looks great with the top up or down, the comfort features (stereo system, navigation, 325 hp)It's one great looking car and pictures don't do this car justice need to see in person.

infiniti,g37-convertible,2010,Ron in PC, 11/03/2010,Awesome Ride,5,"I pondered Lexus, MB, Audi, BMW convertibles.  The G37 won my heart.  Power, comfort, power, styling, power, technology, price, and yes, power.  I have owned it now for 3 months.  I am as pleased as the day I bought it.  No problems and running like a top.   Coast Infiniti was great too.  Simple bottom line price and its closest competition, in my mind, was $6K more with less technology.  If you decide on one, you won't be disappointed.   The only criticism I would note is that the top is a little slow at 28 sec."

In the end I couldn't get over the quality issues on the 335, and the G37 grew on me especially as I compared apples to apples price.

Have had the car for 8 months now -- lots of fun.
A couple of minor grips (have to pay attention to seat belt to keep from closing door on the buckle, top creaks and groans when shut, music juke box isn't as user friendly as it could be), but overall I'm still in love with the car.
Two kids love it too -- it's a bit tight in the back seat, but they manage.

Advice for buyers -- navigation definitely worth the money, tech package not so much."

Not worth buying because of service. I have had Much better service at other manufacturers dealership.

Convertible has a defect. If you inadvertantly leave something in the trunk when trying to open the roof it dents the panels.
A $100 garage door opener reverses itself if it senses something blocking it. You would think a $50,000 car would do the same.
Infiniti says its your fault, so your new car will have two dents in it for using a standard feature of the car. (it my case it was the dealership who did something while servicing the roof top for a squeak.
the rook squeaks. There is a service bulleting for it."

It handles sharp turns quite smoothly just like my 350Z.  I feel as if I'm floating whenever I drive this car.  Definitely smooth!  The Anniversary Edition is absolutely gorgeous inside out.  The red interior is amazing with the rosewood trim which adds a touch of class.  I test drove the BMW 335i which is fun as well, but, the body style was not as intriguing as the G37.  Plus, with a price sticker of 10K more with the features just shy of the G37 made it a no brainer decision for me.  The overall drive of this vehicle is outstanding plus it's fun with the top up or down!"
infiniti,g37-convertible,2010,G P, 07/03/2010,Awesome!,5,"I live in the NYC area and have 10-20 people comment on how beautiful this car is every day. Once I was driving in Manhattan and a professional photographer stopped me to take pics of the car.  The number of people that have asked to take pictures with the car is astounding.  It's like the Holy Grail.  Even without the positive comments, I love this car!  White/white, prem, nav, tech and $8k off sticker price ('09 purchased in 2010).  I also own a Porsche Cayenne S.  In the past 2 months, I've driven the G37 5500 miles and the Porsche 500 miles. Styling and performance were key to me and short of spending $150k+ this is the best convertible out."
infiniti,g37-convertible,2010,tkogrady, 03/01/2011,Ok - not overly impressed,3,"I had hoped to be blown away by this car.
Infiniti has such a great reputation and I loved the car when I test drove it.
But after having had it 9 months, I'm not overly impressed.
The convertible has a lot of creeks and rattles. The Bose sound system has more limited sound and voice controls than I would have thought, and annoyingly inadequate navigation (If you load up the 30 megabyte hard drive on the car with music, you pretty much have to scroll through the music - no voice controls, you can't even skip to letters of the alphabet.
Handles great.
Paint scratches really easily."
infiniti,g37-convertible,2010,Infinity owner, 09/08/2015,The nightmare of the stuck top,4,"This car is beautiful, nice ride, handles well, looks good.  However, there is a huge problem with the top, it will stick between open and close and refuse to do either.  We don't have a local Infinity service in our area, so we took it to the local Nissan, they tried to force it up causing a huge amount of damage.  Had to have the vehicle towed over 2 hours away to the nearest Infinity service center by the time it got there they couldn't do anything with it without body work.

infiniti,g37-convertible,2010,NewInfinitiOwner, 06/01/2010,Everything Great BUT Blutooth Audio Qual,4,"Bought the new 2010 G37 Convertible 3 months ago, overall love it and satisfied except for one major and 2 minor things. Bluetooth cell phone outgoing audio quality is non-usable (noisy) but incoming great. Also seat belt snaps annoying/pop off and driver floor mats slip off hooks daily.  Overall driving, quality of car is excellent except for this items, but for the money the blue tooth should work (dealer saying SW issue, not mic and trying to fix). I went from Lexus 2 dr to this, and this is more fun to drive, handles better/quicker but not as luxurious as Lexus feel. Am getting 20+ mpg on convertible which is good."
infiniti,g37-convertible,2010,Beemer Lover, 05/09/2010,Wish I would have bought the Z4 instead,3,"Let me preface this review by saying that although I am having serious buyers remorse when I chose the G37 Convertible over the BMW Z4, I am not saying that the G37 is not a good choice, it is just not a good choice for me.  I currently own a 2009  BMW M3 Coupe and a 2009 BMW X3, I was looking for a fun to drive convertible that was affordable as well as an eye turner.  I leased the fully loaded model except sport and got a decent lease deal. The good is the interior fit and finish, sound system is great, cooled seats. rosewood trim is a must! The bad is the clunky hardtop that takes forever to open and close and is very wobbly, the seat belts are constantly stuck in the door, NO TRUNK!"
infiniti,g37-convertible,2010,James Dodge, 05/04/2017,"Great, fun car",5,"Just a blast to drive. The fun quotient gives you small trunk space and stiff, rattling ride over pot holes and rough roads. Weigh that against absolutely no repair bills other than regular maintenance, and the most comfortable, agile car I've ever owned. The sport seats adjust every way you could think of and you feel like you are wearing a custom made vehicle. Great car!

infiniti,g37-convertible,2010,Steve O, 10/26/2019,Buy one if you get the chance!,5,"Previously owned a Honda S2000 which I loved!  I needed more room, but wanted a ""spirited +"" driving machine like the S2000. I also wanted another convertible.  My choices were limited, but once I drove the 2010 G37S, my mind was made up!  This car has all the driving dynamics that the S2000 has; cornering, acceleration, overall handling. You feel like you're planted to the road. This car is much heavier than the S2000, but you wouldn't know it by it's handling and comfort. The 325HP is more than what this car needs, but I'm not complaining. 0-60 in around 5.5 which is a little quicker than the S2000. My G37S had 125K on it when I bought it, and now has 137K a year and a half later. No real problems with it. Once in a while the hardtop convert gets stuck coming up, but it's only temporary. Not sure what the problem is, but it always rectifies itself. Other than that, just routine maintenance. Just took it on a road trip and got 26 mpg. I was pleasantly surprised. I routinely get 16 mpg city. I frequently get compliments on the car. It really has a classic low/wide stance. Color is Midnight Garnet, which is really a gorgeous color. The exhaust note is also pretty cool. Bottom line, I'm glad I bought it, and would definitely do it all over again!

infiniti,g37-convertible,2010,SC Gamecox, 04/08/2010,A Fun Driving Experience,4,"I have had my 2010 Infiniti G37 Convertible for about three weeks now. It has the premium and navigation package.  I plan to add another review once I have had the car longer, but since there aren't any as of yet.  The car is a blast to drive and has a very smooth transmission. It is amazing how well it shifts through its gears. The handling is pretty good on it, not Audi A5 strong, but not bad at all.  The technology in the car is fantastic, and the ventilated seats work very well!!  There is a lot to the top going down and up, and it just looks like something that is going to break at some point.  All in all, I don't regret this car and am loving driving it in great weather!"
infiniti,g37-convertible,2010,new used G37, 09/16/2016,new used 2010 g37,4,"there seems to be a little hesitation bw 2nd &  3 rd or 3rd  & 4th gear which leads to a delay when you step on the gas.
The motor in the drivers side ventilated seat has stopped working and the roof leaks.  Otherwise the care seems to be mechanically sound after putting on 12,000 mi in 7 months.  In addition I wish I could stream android.  Although everything appeared perfect when purchased  it wasn't.  Within year of ownership by me (6 yr. old) paint severely faded front brakes and rotors needed to be changed, vinyl on seat side bolsters cracked in 3 places (I thought they were leather on side).  Otherwise runs great.

infiniti,g37-coupe,2010,ulsandy, 07/15/2012,Loud brakes and Horrible Interior,2,"Third time Infiniti buyer and third time was NOT the charm. My car has been in the shop 5 times in the first 14 months of ownership for brake noise. Noise loud enough to be heard inside the house when I enter/exit the driveway. Excuse after excuse from the dealer with no real resolution. First it was a pin, then a hose and now a spring. I have to fight to get them to reproduce every single time. I've been told ""they squeak when they're cold"" then ""they squeak when they're hot"" and finally ""it's not a safety issue"". Opened a case with customer service. What a joke. Called 4 times now, twice spoke to the rep and twice left messages. Not a single thing done as a result of case opened."
infiniti,g37-coupe,2010,Herc95, 07/23/2010,GREAT RIDE!,5,"I previously owned a 2007 G37X Sedan.  It was an awesome car, but I wanted something sportier that I could drive year round.  The G37X Coupe provides that and more.  This is one great ride.  It exudes class yet is a little hot rod.  Top notch quality just like all Infiniti vehicles.  I would highly recommend this car to those considering any other Luxury Sports car."

infiniti,g37-coupe,2010,Kat, 10/22/2010,2nd G37 coupe in 2 years,4,"I traded in my 2009 G37X coupe as I was displeased with its performance (no sport package).  The S coupe has improved performance but I'm puzzled over the persistent surge in rpm during braking.  My guess is that it is the rev matching (failure in system level testing to evaluate this situation or code for it), but it has led to some unsettling moments while stopping or while slowing down on steep mountain roads with curves.   Overall I'm pleased - walked away from purchasing a 335is that I loved due to the value for the dollar of the G.  Nothing else in the price range appealed to me."
infiniti,g37-coupe,2010,Eric, 06/16/2010,Good value,4,"I recently purchased a black 2010 G37S Coupe 6MT.  My previous car was a 2007 BMW 530i (a terrific car, FYI).  I wanted a driver's car and looked at comparable (and more expensive) coupe offerings from BMW and Audi.  The Mercedes was too soft and didn't offer the driving experience I sought. Audi S5 and BMW M3 were high on my initial list, but I kept coming back to the Infiniti as a more practical solution as a daily driver.  The A5's engine kept it out of the running.  335i coupe was a compelling choice but I decided to keep the extra $7-10K in my pocket.  This segment is competitive and I would urge any potential buyer to drive each of these cars.  "

infiniti,g37-coupe,2010,westlake_atx, 04/30/2011,12 month review,3,"I've owned the G37S for 12 months.
It is a great looking vehicle and I think the interior is well laid out and high quality for the price.

I have several complaints about this car (see below), but probably the biggest is that the handling is not really what I expected from a sporty coupe.
I'm guessing I would be happier in the 370Z, but I need the backseat.

Really not a bad car, however, it is not the real luxury value that I expected for $39K.
I guess you get what you pay for.
That said, I would warn anyone coming from Lexus, BMW or Mercedes to understand that this vehicle is not in the same league as far as luxury.
Nor, does it drive nearly as sporty as it appears. "

infiniti,g37-coupe,2010,Chris, 01/15/2017,Engine blows up at 90000 miles,1,"The timing chain broke at 90000 miles and before I could pull over the engine was ruined.  There was no signal on the dashboard that there was a problem but I could hear the valves pinging.  The dealer said the only option was a new engine and offered no compensation or explanation.  I changed the oil religiously with synthetic so there was no problem there. The Infiniti customer service was a joke.  They basically said the car was out of warranty and stuff happens.   My disappointment at buying a ""luxury"" car that didn't make it to 100000 miles can't be explained.  Then they sent me a survey to ask about my experience. I should have gone with the Hyundai, at least Korean companies stand by their products.

infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,captivemind, 01/01/2011,6 months later.....,4,"Excellent overall. It balances handling, comfort and exceptional value. I looked at all the usual suspects. 3 series, C-Class, Acura, Lexus and found the G37 to represent the best of all these brands. 3.7liter is a rocket on wheels, precision handling when pushed and comfortable in city driving. Exceptional navigation system, very easy use with both voice command and touchscreen. Great driving position. I have about 4k miles and its been very reliable compared to my 2008 Audi A6. Service costs are very reasonable. Good long distance cruiser.

Like BMW and Mercedes, G37s are built on independent rear wheel drive platform unlike Lexus ES and Acura TL."
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,emsmith175, 04/13/2015,Perfect balance and combination,4,"Coming from a 2002 Honda CR-V, I wanted something that had some giddy-up that also had the feel of a sports car, but the comfort of a luxury sedan. I was looking at Mustang's and Camaro's that had the driving aspect nailed, but lacked in comfort, gas mileage, and visibility. Luckily, I found this 2010 Infiniti G37X used online with 66k miles on it, and I was IMMEDIATELY in love. It is SO fast, purrs when you drive it, but has all the bells and whistles (and the comfort) of a BMW! Not to mention it's beautiful to look at and is definitely a head-turner on the streets! It's absolutely everything I love in a car. Could not be happier! "
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,ljb5966, 02/25/2011,2nd review,4,"This is my 2nd review of this car after owning it almost a year now.
I have had Zero issues.
It is a beautiful car and a pleasure to drive.

For those who complain that it is not a luxury ride - it will beat you up a little - it is a performance car, not meant for a perfectly cushy ride.
Buy a Caddy or Lexus if you want that!
Do your research before buying.
 Also, take the car for an extended test drive - most luxury brands will allow you to ""lease"" one overnight.
Acura, Infiniti and Volvo all allowed me to do that.
Acura missed a huge market by making the TL larger and longer and Volvo dealerships don't care if you buy a car or not."
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,gib2011, 01/19/2011,Heaven on wheels,4,"I looked at BMW 3 series, Audi A4 and VWcc in addition to the 2011 Infinti G37X.
Overall the 2011 G37x offered a lot more for a much lower cost.

My G37X is all wheel drive with rear view back up cam, blue tooth, navigation, leather heated seats, heated wind screens, bose sound system with cd, dvd player, ipod connections, cd burner, satellite radio,memory stick reader and 30GB storage music box hard drive.

This car is awsome, luxurious and fun to drive.
Its actually faster than the BMW.
 Total price with remote start was several thousands less than the BMW and Audi with similar options."
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,Matt, 10/16/2015,2010 g37x sedan,5,"Bought this car about a year ago with only 18,000 miles. Since then I've almost double the miles since I bought it and it has been the best car I've ever owned. The main reason why I bought this car was for the reliability and performance. (I also own a 350z).  The car is extremely fast for a 4dr sedan and with the awd it gets off the line extremely fast in any condition. With all this power it's hard not to get yourself into trouble. I drive it hard every day and have even tracked the car. Still runs like brand new.  Being in the northeast and having the worst winter on record it always got me where I had to go and never got stuck.

infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,seegee37, 08/13/2013,After almost 3 years,4,"It's almost 3 years since we bought our G, and we have no regrets.

Other than routine servicing, it's only been in for three TB's - one for transmission (it worked), navigation (another story), and the rear passenger window air leak (caused wind noise at speed - corrected).

The initial enthusiasm for the navigation system waned as we regularly were directed to non-existent destinations (such as restaurants in the middle of established residential areas). This is a poor data issue that Infiniti refused to address.

The fuel economy (mainly highway) has consistently amazed us - even at 75 mph we average 26-27."
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,waxahachiejoe, 09/10/2013,Great sport sedan,5,"This is my first ""luxury car"". I bought this car because I wanted a manual shift sport sedan with 300+ horsepower. Today, this means buying a luxury car.
No one makes a regular V6, well equipped sedan, with a stick anymore. I bought my car 3 years old, with 23K miles on it and I LOVE THIS CAR. It's the perfect car for someone that's too old for a mustang GT, needs 4 doors, but still wants a fun to drive stick shift.

I could nit pick this car, but for the money, I can't imagine a better car. Is a BMW 550, a better car?
Sure.
Can you buy one with low miles for under $30K? NOPE."
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,yojako, 11/17/2011,Great for the price,4,"I compare every car to my old E500 so keep that in mind. I also traded a 2009 Lexus E350 for this car so obviously I like the more sporty aspect. This car has 7 ways to access media (music, audio books, etc.), that alone is amazing. The car is tight, handles great on cheap tires, and has enough power to get you in trouble. The transmission is a bit rough, by that I mean it favors sport over comfort. Not all bad, especially on the occasion you're looking for that. My E500 was a superior car in many ways, but was not as reliable and carried a hefty price difference. I love the car, have gotten used to the somewhat choppy downshifting, and look forward to my commute. Can't ask for much more. "
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,ko1119, 06/22/2017,Still love it 4 years later,5,"I bought this car almost 4 years ago and I still love it as much as I did the first day.  It's very sporty and fun to drive, it has a lot of horsepower.  I love the added touch of the logo stitched into the headrests. It's also very smooth and quiet.  The sound system is excellent however a huge downside is it doesn't have Bluetooth! You have to connect a cord from the USB to your phone in order to play music or anything else over the sound system. Another thing I didn't look for when purchasing the car was to see if the back seat fold down, and they do NOT.  There is a small pull down behind the middle seat so you can still stick something through the hole if you need to (like a fishing rod) but the lack of having this capability has caused several inconveniences. I haven't had any costly repairs which is a huge plus, only routine maintenance and the car still runs great.  Overall, I love this car minus not having Bluetooth and the lack of usable space with the seats.  It may be awhile before I move away from Infiniti, and I know what to look for in my next one!

infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,robxc80, 10/26/2010,7 months later,4,"This is my second review and enough time has passed to allow me to share a more honest assessment.  Rear wheel drive with sport suspension paired with the 328 HP really makes this car fun to drive.  only other car in its class that can beat it is the 335 but you get all the fuel pump issues with the bimmer.  The looks are a matter of opinion but i still catch myself staring at my car; madly in love.  Paint quality needs work and having a black car only makes it worse, i hate the paint.  the interior is decent, relatively plain, but very functional and cool in a simplistic way.  Fuel economy for me is horrible at 16mpg city driving, shifter is rough (unlike acura), sound system is fair."
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,scottyb32, 05/24/2012,Just bought this car,4,"My early impressions of this car are mostly positive.
After driving a 325xi for 4 years and putting almost 80,000 miles in it (flipped 118k the day I traded it in), I was very accustomed to that car.
With the G37, I can tell it is definitely a bigger car, and it shows in the passenger space.
The power is addictive, and the handling is very sharp.
 The infotainment screen is very useful and I love the 2 GB hard drive.
The refreshed face for 2010 along with the bright red paint really makes it stand out. Overall, I have to say I miss my beloved 3 series less than I expected."
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,Lynnie, 06/22/2010,Fun to drive,4,"I had to bring in my Infiniti EX35 1 too many times because the last time they gave me a 2010 G37 as a loaner and I had to have it.  I bought it within 1 week of returning the loaner.  The only thing I miss is the hatchback.  I wish the G had fold down rear seats.  I love the way this car handles and drives.  With only 100 miles on it, I did a road trip and put 800 miles on it (highway) and got 27 MPG!  I was very surprised.  In town I am getting in the low 20's.  My EX got about 16 MPG in town.  I am not sure why.  My husband has an Acura TL and he said my car is faster, but that his car handles better."

Did have an issue several months ago where the car was shutting down completely, as in there was no power except to the power seats. No power to horn, windows...nothing. Would try jump staring and nothing, finally disconnected battery over night and charged the battery, next morning started right up, but shortly afterwards it would do the same thing. It puzzled me for several days until I broke down and tried a new battery ( I just knew IT WASNT THE BATTERY ) the car has been back to normal with NO issues !

infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,Jack C, 12/18/2015,Love it with a $$$ Warning,4,"After finally graduating the kids from school I decided to spend some money on myself. I found my dream car in a Garnet and Black G37 Sport Convertible. My love affair with this car was dampened by my most recent visit to the Infiniti dealership to repair the ICC cruise control that would not set. When the service department calls and asks are you sitting down then you know you are in trouble.   $4000 to fix the ICC cruise control.  I talked to the corporate rep and they refused to help at all even though the car has only 37000 miles on it. So I was extremely disappointed that they could care less about protecting the Infiniti brand. So my advice is to never purchase a new Infiniti with expensive bells and whistles.  Look for values on the used market.

Stunning beautiful Graphite Shadow exterior and black interior. And with its curvy body, it stands out, and gets lot of attention. Acceleration is smooth and thrilling.  Driving this car in DS (Drive Sport) mode is like driving a rocket; as soon as I hit the gas, it immediately thrusts forward and makes my back stick to the seat. Handling is excellent as well."

I leased the Infinity G37 on one of their end of the month specials, after test driving and comparing it to the BMW 3 series and Hyundai Genesis Coupe.  Neither of those cars blew me away, but from the minute I sat in this car, I knew I would buy it.  No other car combines the luxury with the performance so well for the price. For the caliber of the car and what it has to offer, the lease deal is amazing.  Every day that I sit in this car, I fall in love all over again, and when buying a new car, don't sacrifice what you love."
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,gnav, 02/28/2017,Great performance!,5,"This car has an incredible engine.  It is a blast to drive.  I have been thinking of trading the car in but everytime I test drive a newer car I realize this car handles better than the newer ones.  The back seats are a little tight so as the kids grow I might not have a choice but to buy something bigger.  This car accelerates like a dream and it has a lot of horsepower for the size car so you Have to be careful as it wants to go fast.  Handling and braking are excellent.  This is my 4th infiniti and all of them have been incredible cars to own.  Premium fuel is a drawback when prices go high, but this engine needs the octane so I am fine with it.  At 7 years old this car still looks great.  Paint has nice fleck and no rust whatsoever.

Trany is rough in auto or sport - dealer, after a few visits cannot identify the problem. Downshifts are unreliable and harsh. Interior noise is not what I would expect; wind, road, and tire noise is louder than it should. Paint quality is poor.

The car has amazing acceleration and handling.  The interior is great.  The version I purchased has the navigation system. This is not something I really wanted, but it is nice.  The navigation system is very good, but it is hard to find your destination sometimes.  My garmin hand held is easier to use.  I love the Ipod option and the XM radio.

Crystal clear image and 2010 also has the backup sonar on Journey.  It is a stiff ride with tight steering.  Drives very much like a sports car. The power is almost overwhelming from this engine.  Seats would be tiring on long trips but comfortable enough.  Sport has better seats with thigh extension. New front is vastly different from 09 and much more aggressive. Lower fog lights really add to the front. Would like some color on the steering wheel, but the new dash is very refined in appearance. New center console is far better than 09, similar now to the FX. VERY happy with my purchase."

The additional horsepower  of the G37 is not immediately noticeable, but the improved gas mileage is.  The car is overall a great package, with the real improvement coming in the improved entertainment/navigation system."
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,BUDMAN, 07/07/2010,My wife's car,4,My wife has been battling cancer; so I wanted to get her a special car. Based on previous reviews most everyone really enjoyed their G37. So we went out and got one. My wife totally loves this vibrant red G37X. Based on her comments and reactions I'm glad we did. Great car. 
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,DB from NC, 09/09/2010,"Very good, but not great",4,"This is a very good car with strong acceleration. The packages are well designed and standard equipment is good. My biggest gripe is with the 7-speed transmission which is jerky between gears 1-4 (apparently a known issue). At highway speeds it's a gem. The stock seats, while comfortable, are just not right for this car. I would seriously consider the sports package just for the unique seats and greater ""snug"" factor."

Made my comparisons and simply the competition doesn't come close to Value for Dollar this car offers. Handling, Balance and Performance are just great, fuel economy is good, it is quite comfortable especially when compared to bmw 335i and toyota IS350 and has a lot of standard features. However Interior quality is quite on par with a mainstream Nissan, although this vehicle is a Nissan, I expected better interior quality since it is badge and marketed as a luxo-brand upmarket product. Bose audio is good not great, I've heard better in similar priced cars like the Genesis"

I've also owned a BMW and would never go back to the brand!  The G's 330 hp is a great improvement. It's fun to drive & handles very well (even through the many East Coast snowstorms).  The AWD has performed flawlessly on all 3 vehicles.  Going back to a 3rd Infiniti was a no brainer.  I've had the car a month and am happy with the combined 22.5 mpg. The car is fully loaded with Premium, Nav and Sport packages.  The 19"" wheels make for a more sporty (i.e. harsher) ride, but that's why I got it!  The redesign for 2010 is a great improvement, both inside and out! "

I initially got this car because my wife and I both liked the design and the standard features were nice.
Overall the car has worked fine for us.
Cons: from day 1, pulling out of the dealer lot the transmission is jerks.
Only happens when the engine starts cold.
Wind noise-always sounds like it's coming from the rear passenger side.
I keep checking to see if my son left the window open.
Pros: the engine is nice, unfortunately it's mated to a terrible tranny.
Wear and tear on the interior trim and leather is nice.
Cleaned up, you could hardly tell there was 32K on this car."
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,Infiniti Owner, 08/19/2010,Not what i expected,3,"4 months have passed since i have owned this car and it is starting to show it's ugly traits. The car rattles whenever you take the slightest road imperfection (mediocre build quality), Paint is filled with many swirl marks (poor paint quality), Interior is starting to peel specially the aluminum trim, Leather is starting to wear badly, Audio speakers are starting to screech when playing certain songs, Transmission produces a loud thump when shifting from P to R or P to D and dealer won't recognize the problem. On the good side performance and handling are exceptional. Very little lean in corners, eager acceleration and precise steering. Somewhat unsettled ride however."
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,Ted, 10/07/2010,Getting used to the bells and whistles,4,"Thanks to all who posted reviews of the G37x. I've had mine 2 weeks. Took some getting used to after 12 years in a Buick Regal GS. I agree with a lot of the critical comments and the praise as well. Don't like the CVT transmission in low gears, esp. 1-3. Has a lot of punch after that when you need it. Handling is terrific and I do like the steering feel. Bose audio is good but not great. For the money i think this is an excellent value and I got a 2010 at a great price, plus 0% financing. It's going to take me a year to figure out all the high tech bells and whistles.We'll see how the AWD does this winter."
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,BigMac, 01/20/2010,"Great Car, But.....",4,"I expected more attention to detail and luxury appointments on the inside. Listen Up Infiniti! 1. The LCD information screen is low resolution and has washed out colors;  2. The cup holder cover is designed to be a push to open type of cover. However, Infiniti has made this cover with a lip on the front which naturally makes you want to lift the cover manually - just can't help it. This will eventually break the catch; 3.Windows are auto down but NOT auto up. The sunroof is auto close so why not the windows; 4. Cheap plastic fuzzy lining and ""coin holder"" in the center arm-rest storage is not up to Infiniti standards. "

This car handles very well, definitely better than the BMW 3 series and it is larger (closer to 5 series). With AWD and options, it is also 5-10K cheaper than a comparable 335, providing an excellent and in many ways a better option. However, interior build quality is not even close to the BM, Mercedes, or lexus (while exterior design is). Materials used is also not as good. It seems like the brand is a bit stuck between high-end luxury brands and upgraded Nissan. There is a need also for more ads on TV++ similar to BMW, Audi, Lexus to enforce the luxury brand image. Real fun to drive."

So far, ( have put 2000 miles on it) it's the best overall car I've owned.  It does everything well that you would expect it to.  The gas mileage is running around 21 mpg combined city and freeway. But I didn't buy it for the mpg I bought it for fun!  Haven't had to take it back to the dealer for even the slightest problem.  Got the vibrant red with the graphite/maple wood interior.  The most frequent comment is 'gorgeous'.  My previous car was a late model Accord V6 EX  which was a nice car.  Even taking into account the price differential the g37x is a better value."

I have friends with Mercedes, BMWs, etc. and they can't touch this. Luxurious interior, gorgeous exterior and all the tech toys you could want. The Premium and Navigation packages are essential, and the Premium Wheel and Tire package looks great as well. Handles extremely well and is a blast to drive. It's a comfortable car to cruise in, and as soon as you hit the gas it becomes a rocket on wheels. The perfect combo of luxury sedan and sports car, and highly recommended. Be aware that if you take it for a test drive you'll likely want to drive one home. "
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,Bravo1, 04/08/2010,New G Owner,4,"Purchased a G37 Journey with Premium, Navigation and Sports Package.  With the sports package the ride is firm but never harsh; but some people will probably want a slightly more compliant ride.  Cornering limits are very high, but the car is easily upset by uneven pavement so the car can feel a little nervous.  On smooth pavement this car performs flawlessly, with good grip, braking and acceleration.  The transmission with the rev matching feels a little awkward at first but you quickly get use to it. Car is definitely happier at speed than just taking it easy. Overall fit and finish appears to be high and the car is quite comfortable to ride around in.  Feature content is through the roof"

It is sporty yet comfortable and fun to drive.  I purchased my Sister a 2008 G35X and knew I would consider this car, her car has been the best car she has ever owned especially with the winter we just had on the East Coast, my nephew also bought an G37X 2010 in the fall of 2009, he tested a Lexus and BMW but the G blew the others away, I tested the same and agree.  BMW rides to hard with the run flat tires, Lexus rides to soft and does not handle as well. I know I will enjoy this car for years to come.  "

Purchased for my wife - It came down do the TL vs the G37.  No question best value for the money is the Genesis....one heck of a car for the money, but too ""mom & pop"" for my wife.  The beemer is best at putting power to the ground, but too much more $ and didn't have the interior appeal of the G37.  It is absolutely a rocket on wheels - passing on the highway you're doing 90 before you know it.  Just took it on a 150 mi trip. seats are a little too firm, ride is good.  This isn't a touring sedan but for running around, it's an absolute blast to drive"
infiniti,g37-sedan,2010,Bob, 08/13/2010,Impressed,4,I traded in a 2009 Acura TL tech for the G37 and so far it has been a great choice. The TL is a very good car but it did not get me emotionally involved but was a pleasant car to drive. The TL tech is too complicated and has too much stuff and too many buttons. The G37 is truly remarkable and very fun and engaging to drive. It is nimble and very fast. I like the lines better and the interior is much better and more intuitive. I have the polished wood accents and just love it. Great car for the price and really exciting to drive and own!

After trying the new BM, Lexus is, Mercedes. We bought an Infiniti G37X. It is a very good quality car with a fantastic engine and transmission. Overall workmanship of the interior is not as good as BM or Mercedes definitely, but still very good. One of the adjustments we had to make was the frequent service intervals. In BMW or Mercedes, intervals are 15,000 miles. In infiniti, it is 3750 miles. This means 2-3 more visits to the dealer/service. In addition, Infiniti is not as generous as BMW or Lexus, which provide loaner cars for all service vis"

No problems except for a bit of wind noise from right rear fixed glass - the dealer ordered a new seal.  Love the handling, acceleration, and extensive interior appointments.  Transmission is acceptable, but not extremely smooth.  Ride is well controlled and fairly comfortable.  Road and tire noise is higher than expected on concrete surfaces. "

The only other vehicle that could compare to this vehicle was the BMW 335Xi and the Acura TL with SHAWD in terms of performance. Next, I compared the price and BMW was automatically eliminated.

However, that is where my love of the car ends.  The transmission is very rough, particularly in the lower gears.  The car jerks as it passes through the first three gears - both up and coming back down.   Also, the car bounces a lot when traveling on highway.  Feels like I'm not a very inexpensive car.  Lots of road noise too.  Headlights don't light high enough on the sides of the road.  I travel daily on roads heavy with deer crossing and need high beams to see enough.

I have owned a M5 and have a 911 so I am not gonna drive this car often, but i must say it performs nicely.  But i think its more for a professional girl. If you are a guy thinking you are getting some kind of cool sports car, you obliviously purchased the wrong car.  A bmw 335 will smoke it, and its a 4 door sedan, you may want to get the coupe.

I've loved the brand but I was forced to look out for a new brand because Nissan stopped offering a standard tranny.  I'm glad this was the case.  I love my new Infiniti G37 6MT sport.  It's got more than enough power, the stiffer ride is perfect for my tastes and it handles like a dream. Although not offering as much head room as an 09 Max, it's comfortable enough for a 6'4"" guy like myself.  I would definitely recommend this vehicle for those who are looking to enter the luxury market."

All that adds up to a 48k G37, but it's still almost 11k less than a comparably equipped and less powerful 3 series or other European sedan. Don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic vehicle without these options, and people have to purchase within their respective budgets, but I often hear complaints that may have been remedied buy the selection of certain option packages. The bottom line is that it can't be beaten when you look beyond price and look to quality, refinement, power, fun and prestige. "

Still new to the area, so the Nav system helps and is the best one seen to date. I love the fact that I have all my music on a USB stick and can use it with the system (no Ipod yet).

Very good looking car. I purchased it new.
We noticed that the car does not handle well. When you go into a turn, it feels like the front tires are beginning to slide. I purposely drove it into a corner unusually fast ( plenty of recovery space) and the car does slide badly.
I took it back to the dealership and they said it was perfect. Well, if that's perfect, don't expect me to purchase another infiniti.
We have replaced the brakes including calipers and rotors numerous times. Calipers freeze up often. It will stop on a dime, but having to replace the brakes every 15,000 to 20,000 miles is beyond excessive.

The sunroof doesn't work properly, and one of the tweeters from the sound system, which is excellent by the way, is fading out. Nevertheless you'd expect something like that from a car with 110K on it. Other than that the car is awesome. I need to do some regular maintenance on it and it'll be perfect.

I t-boned someone and the car crushed in all of the right places.  Thank God it wasn't totalled.  I am still driving and I drive it like I hate it.  I plan to get over 300,000 mi. out of this car.

Saler said he just put new alternator or starter in. Can't remember. As soon as I drove home it was smoking!! Power steering leak. Mechanic put in one new power steering hole and it began to leak on the way home again. Replaced other part of power steering hose (longer hose) also my caliber on passenger side had froze up. Now that is replaced it rides so nice. Idk wat others are talking about with making turns because I be whipping my turns in this car. Feels nice when driving and I have faith that i will get my money worth or more. I lllooovvveeee my Infiniti.

The car is pretty rough mechanically, and needs a lot of work. The engine and transmission are still great, after 10 years and 200k miles.  I changed the spark plugs and the check engine light went off, only to come back on a day later. Has weird exhaust noise (prob not the cat conv.) and the struts were completely shot (got those replaced) and I think the mass airflow sensor is bad. A common problem on this car.

infiniti,i30,2000,BP, 07/26/2008,"Nice car, but bad reliability.",3,"I bought this car about a year ago with 45k miles on it and have had problems ever since.  Upon purchase I had to replace the belts (which is to be expected for a 7 year old car). What I didn't expect was the catalytic converter to fail (which Infiniti covers up to 80k miles), the A/C compressor to fail, all 6 coils needed to be replaced, the muffler was banging the bottom of the car and the CD player stopped working.  At this point, about $2500 has been spent on repairs. Luckily we bought an extended warranty.  My other car is a Nissan Altima and I really like it. But, I doubt I'll be buying another Infiniti."

At 70k the ignition coils went out and at 90k the starter had to be replaced. I looked on some blogs and found all of these to be common problems. I see that at 100K I should expect all my instrumentation lights to go out and the check engine light to keep coming on. I have spent over $3500 in repairs so I'm now looking to buy a new car that will be under a warranty. I can't afford to keep paying for costly repairs on a once great car.

However, the car now has 97K and has needed a new radiator and another catalytic converter (there are 4), has developed a transmission leak, needs a new starter and the AC has stopped working (all in 2 months!!!).

the Japanese luxury cars. I found a 
great deal used and I love it. It has a 
great ride, and I just have to step on

perfect climate control and not too 
soft or firm seats. Engine performance 
and economy is exceptional for a 3.0 
liter V6. Stereo performance is 
oustanding. I find the styling to be 
bland, but this is forgivable in a car

difference. The ride is compeletly 
different from the Pontiac. It's smooth 
quite, and luxurious. I just love the 
3.0-liter 227-hp. V6 engine. It's so 
POWERFUL for a front-drive V6 sedan. As 
much as the car is powerful and 
luxurious, it's also safe with dual 
front and side airbags and 4-wheel ABS. 
Other things that I love about this

standard features than I have ever 
seen in any other luxury brand, and 
its 200-Watt Bose 7 Speaker sound

with the best V6 in the world prove

I run premium gas and have talked with the dealership.  They indicated they could try cleaning the injectors but there weren't any guarantees  this would fix the problem.  I would not buy a 2000 model year again.  Go up to at least a 200X model that has the 3.5 liter motor and higher horsepower.

I didn't think cars failed at 50,000 miles anymore.Should the manufacturer take some responsibility for their product?  I think so.  "

a year, with this car.  I could not 
find a better value in this class, and 
I looked at the usual suspects - 
Lexus, Audi, Lincoln LS, Acura, etc. - 
before deciding on the I30.  Reading 
some professional reviews, it seems to 
me there is a bias against this car 
due to similarities w/ Maxima.  But it 
provides more refinement, nice luxury 
features and better styling.  I 
wholeheartedly recommend!"

at higher speeds, handles the road very
well, it has a lot of power and pick-up,
and it looks nice.
Extremely reliable.My infinity has 86000
miles so far and (knock on wood) I only 
had to replace windshield wipers, tires 
and a headlightbulb."

all the time, this car more than makes 
the ride pleasent.  When i was looking 
to buy a car, i look at BMW, Jaguar, 
Lexus, MB, and one ride in this car 
sold me.  The navigation system was so 
easy to use and so helpful in my 
transition to a new city.  Takeing

I love this deal! (So does she!) I value perf, handling, luxury & style, which I30 has plenty. High wind noise is no issue because I play loud metal on excellent Bose stereo. Wife treated it like baby, garaged it, so it's immaculate. After recent extensive prev maint, fixing silly trash can lid dash compartment, & installing hi-perf tires, it's LIKE NEW. Other than bad alt & occaisional coil misfire (we replaced all coils), it has been very reliable. Interior is spacious and luxurious. My car status is now excellent! I plan to drive it many more years."

It may look Japanese generic on the outside, but I'm grateful for the restraint: I'm not anxious to be noticed, especially in a car where sudden bursts to 90-plus mph are so effortless.  It's not quite as tossable as, say, the current Infiniti G, but it's a good way to get into the Infiniti Experience for next to nothing."

However in 4 years I spent less on that car then I've spent in the past 9 months on the I30.  Had it checked out before we bought it, all systems were a go.  However within 2 months the alternator went out.  Shortly after that the car started misfiring, and it started running poorly and jerking when at a stop light.  Had the engine coils replaced along with the spark plugs and a full maintenance check + fluids flush.  Also have had to replace both rear and front brakes.  So 9 months and at least $3,000 later, hopefully we are done for awhile with spending money on it."

Driving impressions: the car is like a tank in the city: huge turn radius, horrible mpg (14/city), poor rear visibility makes it hard to park. Performance is ok for 230hp. I come from 97 528i, and some minor features are missing, and interior quality is not as great. HID lights are all fogged out by now and barely illuminate the road. However, over 2 years I only had the following issues: replaced ECU and defective idle control valve ($500), power steering hose ($300). Oxygen sensor fault popped up once in a while - replaced spark plugs and now it's gone (at least for now). That's all! Now the pros - read them in the favorite features below."

Performance is decent but coming from a RWD V8 to a FWD V6 was a little disappointing. Don't get me wrong I love my I30, but its conditional love. This car has been an absolute nightmare. The VSS was replaced twice, MAF sensor is prone to replacement, ECM burned up due to sudden fault in the Idle Control. Suspension is very soft even for a sedan. Besides this long list of expensive i mean very expensive repairs, I enjoy driving this car. It has a very responsive throttle and gets attention where ever it goes. "

Very comfortable and refined interior and classic exterior body styling.  This car has clearly spoiled me.  It is going to be difficult to replace this level of refinement and trouble-free driving, and do it with a reasonable  price tag.  Mileage has been better than expected for this size vehicle, combined driving consistently averaging 25.  Only complaint is the underbody design puts stress on the exhaust system; I have had to replace it three times.  Other than that, just routine maintenance."

It just feels like an all around great ride, smooth, classy, and reliable.  Very few trips to the shop each year, usually one thing at a time, the kind of problems that come with an aging auto.  At best I've been able to squeeze 29 or 30 mpg on long highway drives, of which I've been doing a lot of.   My favorite part about reading other I-30 reviews is how long everyone intends to keep theirs until 300,000 miles.  I'm passing mine down to my younger brother, in favor of a newer car.  No doubt it'll keep running."

Replaced alternator, starter, belts and oxygen sensors. Lately its its been stalling and dealer says we need a new transmission, probably another $2000 in repairs. We bought the car for $4200 with the intention of keeping it for one year and so far we've spent $1900 in repairs. We should have just bought something new."

The interior and exterior are beautiful. There are technologies on this vehicle that I think even the Germans can still borrow from to add to some of their ""future"" vehicles :-). Don't get me wrong, German engineering is still up there but this car holds it's own. The question potential buyers of this vehicle may want to ask themselves is ""can you afford this""?.

Well known radio/CD issues with this car that Infiniti never offered to fix for owners.  Outside temp does not show unless asked for.  Gas mileage for a car this size is poor and the amount of road noise is in unacceptable range.  I cannot have a decent cell phone call while on the highway in the I30.

O2 sensors were replaced under warranty.  I purchased it with a certified used warranty from the local Infiniti dealer.  This with worth the premium I paid.  That warranty was good until 100K miles and the service I received was excellent.  My complaints are that the vinyl seat edge is wearing out on the driver's side.  Everything else in the interior still looks great.  I wish it got better gas mileage about 23 overall - but given the size and power of the car that's not bad.  Very comfortable.  Quick but a little heavy feeling.  Very solid feeling."

Cruises effortlessly on European highways with cruise control set at nearly 100mph.  Excellent midrange power at the expense of fuel economy.  Suspension is tuned for comfort; car gets unsettled during small-radius backroads turns.  After 60,000 miles only problem has been with O2 sensor, otherwise trouble- free.  I can foresee keeping this car for at least another 5 years.  The Bose radio alone merits this, though the rear parcel shelf mounted subwoofer can become boomy. Otherwise, great value, great car."

Average 27 - 28 MPG on premium @ steady 68 MPH. Paid 13K, just put $1600 in for above repairs.  Excellent road car.  Fussy about tire pressures on Potenzas G009.  Too much results in hard ride.  Bose great, A/C fantastic, not much wind/road noise.  This is not a cheap car to maintain at the dealer, however I highly recommend using only the dealership for service. OEM replacement parts for this car are the only way to go.  It should be put on the computer every time it goes for service.  Car should go 200K miles relatively trouble free"

Very good on highway cruising.  long list of options but the material quality isn't up to acura/lexus.  doesn't have MIST wiper operation that sweeps only once (even civic has this feature).  need to turn on the wiper and turn off for occational wiper sweep.  Trunk space is HUGE.  interior space is HUGE as well.  Standard HID is good but need more brightness."

I graduated to this v6 and have really 
enjoyed the additional power vs my v4 
Toyota. The car handles well and is 
quick.  My biggest criticism is that 
the ride is rough.  It's like I can 
feel every change in the road's 
surface. Also, there seems to be a 
whistle of air, the origin of which I 
cannot determine.  I like the sun visor 
feature which allows you to block out 
the sun coming from the rear window, 
with just the touch of a button. I 
think it is stylish and still looks 
good among newer cars.  The ABS is good 
but my Subaru Outback rides better and 
has better brakes.   "

miles.  Car ran great, looked great, 
rode great.  Have put additional 8000 
miles on since purchase.  This is, 
absolutely without a doubt, a super 
road car. It's comfortable, smooth, 
classic looking and I'm averaging 27-
28 mpg running at 70 MPH.  Have 
switched tires to 225 x 65 x 16 
(Regatta 2s) at 35 PSI and ride is 
super smooth (tire diameter goes from 
25"" to 27"") and they really fill up 
the wheelwells.  I expect to keep this 
one close to 200000 miles or more

infiniti,i30,2001,Raj Venkat, 01/05/2005,Bang for the buck,4,"Got it used with 68200 miles on it for dealer trade-in price. What a beauty! It is one of the most elegant Infinitis around (past and present). The engine revs effortlessly and the transmission shifts smoothly. Very sturdy at highway speeds of 80 mph. The leather seats are large and comfortable and it is so roomy inside. It definitely likes only premium fuel as I hear an annoying growl when I press the gas with 87 octane fuel. Mileage is not as good as I thought, 21 mpg mixed driving and 26 mpg on highway. The tornado fuel saver did not improve mileage. There is an annoying rattle coming from around the beautiful analog clock when the ext. temp is cold but disappears when the car warms up."

The reading light has burned out four times due to an apparent short that the dealership only identified after the warranty was gone. Leather has been faster to wear than in my Maximas.  And the heater/AC motor has developed a loud growl that goes away after 2-3 minutes. Car still looks ""fresh"" after 6 years and 101,000 miles.  Seats are comfortable.  Turning radius is awful.  It's like turning the Titanic in a farm pond. All in all, though, a good investment and outstanding driving machine for the open road."

Once the power steering fuel had to be replaced, another time some minor things.The only concern is that after 100K miles when you see these minor problems, they all add up very fast, for instance it took me $200 to replace the HID headlights. But let me tell you I have done three cross country trips in this car without a trace of discomfort! The leg space is amazing for both front and rear passengers. I haven't met anyone who is not impressed with its interiors. Drive feels very secure. Perfect family sedan! Can't imagine to part with it!"

The engine and tranny are great i am at 200K right now and have tried to beat the car up and still it goes strong. I would recommend this car to anyone as it is one of the most reliable engines out there. Infiniti will get more business from me in the future.

The A/C is ice cold. You would never know this vehicle has 92,000 miles on it. A true looker! I drove a 1998 INFINITI I30 for 197,000 miles until the timing chain went. Enjoyed that very reliable car too, but this vehicle is so much more roomier and comfortable. INFINITI definitely improved the model tenfold in introducing the I35. OUTSTANDING!"

I've only had 2 repairs with this car, radiator and steering fluid replacement.
Mind you, it's best if you immediately repair any issues before it gets worse because it can get pricey. I engine lights comes on from time to time.
I believe its because of the amount of oil in the engine.
Once I add oil to lights come off. Who knows!
Once I felt my radiator was going bad I fixed it pronto. Trust me you will save lots of money.

You would be Really hard pressed to find a car back in 2002 such as the I35.  Acceleration could Not be beat!  After installing a rear anti-sway bar, handling improved exponentially. My only gripe about the car was the lack of heated seats.  The dealership offered to order one at the time, but we would've had to wait 3+ weeks for it.  I'm actually considering keeping it, just because we have Never had a problem with the car.  It's very safe, Very fun to drive, and mine is perhaps one of the Best Kept ones out there.

I expect to drive this car literally until the wheels fall off, and I know that it will be a long, long time before that happens.  This is a wonderful, superbly built car.  Build quality and reliability are excellent.  The I35 was probably the best car (durability and reliability wise) that Infiniti ever built.

Overall it's been a great car with a few fun luxury perks to it.  The gas mileage isn't bad for a V6 engine and for how quick it is.  I've had to replace my 6 disc CD changer once (which was pricey) because I had a skipping CD inserted and it disabled my entire dashboard. Apparently it was a problem my repair guy said happens to this model of car...?  I also had to replace my rear brakes.  It's a fun car to drive, but the repairs are pricey- which is something I expected anyway with a luxury vehicle."

The one I got is the sports base model and its kind low for me and turning raduis is worst than my G500 SUV. Im surprised with the acceleration and steering is very tight. Braking is also very good. For a 11 year old car with 157k thats awesome. Mileage is around 24 to 28 mpg. Bose system is the best part of the car. Its like listening to a high end system at home. Like any other car just make sure you get one that is well taken care of with no accidents etc. 
infiniti,i35,2002,RobFinFLL, 02/14/2002,I35 is a deal,5,"Had my I35 for 3 weeks.  Its a great car.  Excellent combination of luxury, performance and value, with roomy interior and big trunk.  Best part is price.  Its loaded at $30k.  Cars like the Volvo S60, Audi A6, Toyota Avalon, Lexus ES300, look good in ads at $399 leases, etc., but when you add the options to these cars needed to match the I35, the I35 wins by several grand."

Replaced rear brake calipers three times due to faulty design. Cam-shaft sensors twice, MAF sensor, numerous vacuum lines due to splitting, leather interior stitching came apart. Moonroof motor, and alternator.Car spent more time in shops then serving the family, and I now have sworn off Nissan , though I own a 72 datsun 240 and a 1991

I get about 20-22 mpg for city/hwy which is not bad for a car this size that is also very fast. Quality build, never had to spend a dime on it except for regular maintenance.  After passing 90k I sometimes see the check engine light, but it goes away after a couple of days. These cars cost a bit more initially, but pay for themselves in the long run.

New radiator and radiator fan. New catalytic converter (there are 3). Note that it is better to just wait and see if engine light goes off after a while, because diagnostics have brought up a range of repair suggestion every time- from catalytic converters to oxygen sensors-(now light is off). Highway driving is smooth. Passenger side seat motor broke but is in good position. Gas mileage not bad. Overall happy with this car."

The second day after purchasing the car it would not start, had it towed to the dealer and they told me i needed to replace some battery harness cable, starter, alternator, and a few more items, honestly cant remember them all. After all that the car never went more than 2 weeks without the engine light coming on. Blew 2 ignition coils, catalytic converter, a few sensors. Car had many oil leaks. The car is very expensive to maintain with high miles. Spent roughly $2500 in repairs over the course of a year. But some how you manage to overlook all the faults the car had, because you love this car. Yes it broke down all the time and costs you a lot of money to maintain, but when you drive this car you feel like a million bucks, even with the paint fading, and the bumper falling off, the light smoke slipping out of the cracks of the hood, the duck tap covering the huge rips in the leather.

Suspension is the worst, pretty much intolerable. The engine has the most obnoxious clunking I have ever heard. Was recently told the muffler and catalytic converter will need to be replaced asap as these do not pass inspection.

Spark plugs, hoses costing $700, O2s, transmission, motor mounts (twice), struts, CD player doesn't work (55,000 miles ago), sun roof opens at will and now it decided not to close. It sounds like there's a window open in the car all the time. If you put too much base on the radio the rear view mirror shakes to the beat (WOW!); that happened from the beginning. Oil leaks.

Problems were engine mounts, emissions, struts, power steering pump, etc. It's interesting because they are the only luxury cars under 80k going for <$5k and they look awesome, but I think there's a reason for the cheap price.

Overall I've had a good experience with it, other than the known problems such as turning radius and fuel efficiency, Infiniti has done a good job. Very spacious room front and back. Too much similarity in interior parts with Maxima and Altima, is this supposed to be a luxury sedan. Sound system really stinks!"
infiniti,i35,2002,JOKER, 05/26/2009,Great Car,4,"This is a great car. I had this car for about 3 yrs now and I only had some minor problems considering that I have 130000 miles on it.

Today I decided that I have good enough knowledge about the car. So now I can write a good review supported with real facts.  1. Handling - The car handles very well and it is also very secure. In high speeds feels very stable and the stability control system works very good.  2. Power (255hp) - When I press the gas pedal the car accelerates very quickly. The engine is one of the 10 best engines ever made. It also goes to NISSAN 350Z, no need for more comments.  3. Interior quality and design - The seats are not the best I've seen but they are good enough. The interior is very nice and the sound is great."

I test drove quite a few competitors: Lexus ES300 - weird interior, Camry-type feel, weak engine; Acura TL - cramped but well designed interior, sleek look, decent power, but car dealers insist on MSRP, sometimes asking higher prices for certain in-demand colors/options, which I find unethical; Audi A4 - excellent interior, but the smallest of those tested, nice power, very ugly rear end, easily the most expensive car tested, great engine.

The car has had multiple electrical, gas, sun roof, heating and cooling problems. With 121,000 miles, I knew it wouldn't be perfect. We had to buy motor mounts, due to a vibration in the car, the car has stalled out numerous times and been towed 3 times in the last 6 months, which included smoke coming from the engine 3 times.

Unfortunately, the Maxima's styling is 
odd and it is difficult to configure 
one the way I want it without having to 
accept options which I do not want, 
such as the moon roof and heated seats.

The handeling is a blend of sport and 
comfort. I do not drive like the people 
of Car and Driver so, the more extreme 
characteristics of a car are not too 
important to me. The I beam suspension, 
for example, is fine with the driving I 
do; I won't be entering a cross country

yet you're always aware of the 
horsepower.  Some wonder if it's a 
glorified Maxima.  Like others, I found 
that it's poorer Nissan cousin would 
have been nearly as expensive given my

G35. Our goal was to find a nice sedan 
to replace our Honda Odyssey.

We were so impressed with the I35 that 
we bought the one in the showroom.  It 
had more space than than the G35, and 
had more bang for the buck than the 
other cars that we had looked at.  

Although I thought we would buy a 
C240, I am not unhappy that we did 
not.  For $8,000 less we got more room 
and horsepower.  

While the G35 is more of a sports 
sedan (watch out BMWand Audi), the I35 
is a luxury sedan - which is what we 
were after.

(BMW, Audi, Acura, VW, Lexus, Saab) 
heavily.  BMW & Audi isn't worth the 
price.  Saab scares me being run by 
GM.  That left me with TL-S & I35.  TL-
S is slightly better, but I35 makes an 
offer you simply can't refuse.  I look 
forward to 10 years of worry-free

your money, hands down."

blast.  Time spent commuting is fun 
with this thing.  Love the sound

me."
infiniti,i35,2002,Mr Coburn, 02/28/2002,Arizona I35,4,"My wife and I decided to purchase the I35 based on very detailed car market elimination.  The Acura TL-S type has inferior interior build quality especially the leather seats, and the exterior lacks style.  The Lexus I-300 is too small and cramped! Good build quality but about $3000.00 more than a loaded I35. The I35 has the best warranty and bang for your dollar!! We got a loaded one with window tint and auto rear sun screen and in dash 6 CD changer. For $30,000.00 out the door."
infiniti,i35,2002,BZ in Beloit, 12/30/2002,Mixed emotions,3,"This car is a love-hate.  I love the 
engine performance.Under throttle the 
torque steer is unbelievable.  The 
engine is smooth as silk up to the 
redline.  Transmission shifts nicely.  
The seats are uncomfortable for long 
trips. The stereo is excellent. The 
heated steering wheel is too hot, even 
through gloves.  The heated seats are 
nice in the cold. The gas mileage is 
pitiful.  Don't believe the trip 
computer because it lies.  The 
instrumentation sucks, well positioned 
but inaccurate.  My speedometer is 7% 
inaccurate and no one will fix it.  The 
climate control works very well.

When I need power, the 255 hp. engine kicks in nicely. The only item that would make it more fun to drive would be a manual shift stick.  

The price difference between a loaded I35 & a loaded Maxima was about $2K.  I think the interior & exterior refinements as well as few extra luxury items make it worth the difference."

former Accord. Highway ride is smooth & 
road noise is low. Except for the hard 
to find gear shift position indicator, 
controls & gauges are well laid out & 
the interior is comfortable. Some of

All doors are hard to close. The Bose

Every issue that has come up has been covered under warranty at no additional cost to me and the dealership service experience has been top notch. The only reason I rated it a 9 for comfort is that I have the Sport Package which has a slightly stiffer ride than the non-sport version. But it is a blast to drive and very comfortable to ride in.

everything else from the great sound

infiniti,i35,2003,cgiunt, 09/18/2013,Amazing Car!!! Will Always Drive and Keep One,4,"Although this Infiniti is my first car, I must say what a dream it has been to own. I bought this car in early 2012 with 117,000 miles on the odometer and have since put on close to 20,000 miles without a single problem. Gas mileage is very good for 134,000 miles averaging 25mpg between highway/city driving. The performance was top notch for it's time and is still a high level competitor today. Car drives great on the GLE suspension and the 215/55/R17 tires make for a nice mixture of ride comfort and handling. The car truly is a low end sports car with great luxury features and very good interior quality. Very little I would change about this car...will always have one."

infiniti,i35,2003,JDA, 10/15/2006,An under the radar superstar!,4,"My unreliable E430 had to go; I wanted a reliable, fast, sedan, with a hint of luxury. I had a Maxima before the Mercedes, so I decided to try a ""Luxury Maxima."" Picked one up used/cheap, since they have been discontinued and are overshadowed by the G35, and have now had it 6 months. Nondescript exterior style does not draw attention to the powerful V-6 underneath. Seriously: people underestimate this car all the time - until you blow them away; the engine delivers power at all speeds. I have averaged 22 mpg in mixed driving. I have had two minor service issues, but both were covered under warranty - Roseville Infiniti has treated us well...so far: they know I want a G35 in 2008.      "

I do not recall ANY problems during the dealer maintenance period and follow on has been limited to replacement of belts and hoses which I do on a 3-year cycle. Did have a wheel bearing go out and was an unusual and unexpected repair. Even with 84K miles, computer is registering 25.5 MPG avg which has reduced from about 26.5 for the first 4 years. A great cost of ownership vehicle."
infiniti,i35,2003,Tom, 08/13/2009,Solid car for the money,4,"I bought this car looking for comfort, performance/sportiness, luxury/sleek elegant look and a bit of exclusivity. 12k miles into it I've found all this and then some.  Among the competition, (es300/TL), I went with the i35 due to its performance (3.5L versus 3.0, 3.2), comparable gas mileage (20/26), comfort in the little things (sunshade, rear heated seats, sojourner leather), build quality and reliability (its a maxima in disguise). TL's and ES300's are a dime a dozen, this car was Infiniti's hidden car. Its nice to roll in a car that has a lot of everything, yet isn't seen 5 times in 1 in block.  The ride is very smooth and no major issues have arrived. "

I have had to do is change my oil+filter.  I so far have never had to refill oil in between changes, my tires are in great shape, and all components still work great.  I really liked the interior and the soft leather seats.  The car is quiet and has a powerful engine.  It's a sleeper car in that it is very nondescript, but it also has a streamlined look. The drive is not comparable to a sports sedan but that's not the point.  It handles well for its size in the corners and has good balance.  The steering feedback is very good as well."

Lincoln LS and Acura TL--as well as 
BMW 3-4 series---this car is the best 
buy for the price.  Infiniti is priced 
5-7K under the competition with a car 
that out performs the competiton. I 
hate spending 30+K on a car and 
getting a little engine--The I35 will 
leave everything in its class sitting 
still.  Incidentally bargain hard and 
you will get this car in the 27-29K 
range--competitors cannot match the 
price!  I love this car!"

Only performed routine maintance. Beautiful inside & out. Great service from dealerships. This car has everything that an engineer can ask for in a car that does everything so well and refined. Gives you an adrenaline rush when driving although it's not as great as our Maxima. Surprised that it gets 26.8 MPG our Maxima gets 27.6 MPG. Will keep forever cause it runs like a champ and is truly a beast of a vehicle...both the Maxima & I35
infiniti,i35,2003,Zach, 05/03/2010,Much to be Improved Upon,3,"Was a fantastic vehicle until it passed 60k miles. Even with continuous maintenance, it sucks gas, has serious suspension problems, eats through tires, burns oil, the transmission is going, and the muffler has rusted completely off. It now has 68,000 miles on the odometer and has eaten $5000+ in repair costs. It has also left me stranded 1000 miles from home when the TPS (throttle position sensor - once recalled) died. That out of town repair was $1000 alone."
infiniti,i35,2003,Disappointed , 09/19/2008,Disappointed,2,I purchased this vehicle just about 5 years ago because I had heard so many great things about Infiniti. The first 3 years were good but then my oil was always running low and they could never diagnose it. Now I only have 87000 miles and the engine has failed. That is certainly not what I expected from an auto dealer with their perceived quality. Their customer satisfaction department was anything but satisfying and I will now be buying a BMW!

Great engine, great near- luxury interior, great value.  Sporty (stiff) suspension.  Bose radio is terrible.  It is all bass, very muddy sounding.  No treble whatsoever. The worst car radio I've ever heard! You will have to replace the speakers if you like listening to music.  Turning radius is embarrasing.  Like driving a bus in a parking lot.

for the value, the I35 was perfect.  
Lotsa horsepower, super interior 
appointments, and a great blend of 
luxury features.  Yes, it is a Max in

$2,500 more for my I35 and got 
outstanding dealer service, 4 year B2B

the fog lights.  I would also add a 
little more zip to its performance when 
starting.  The car seems a little 
slugish when starting out.  I would 
probably check out the G35 coupe but, I 
like the I35 ride better."

performance.  The Xenon lights are the 
best!  Nissan/Infiniti is way better 
than Honda/Acura!  Honda's have become 
too common now and Acura cars still 
look like Hondas.  I love the build

Made in Japan."

bit noisy on the freeway.  The exterior 
design lacks the classy look of the 
earlier I30 models.  It is responsive, 
with the notable exception of the 
turning radius.  I find the sounding of 
the horn at with the remote door lock 
to be annoying.  The interior is 
beautiful but a misplaced finger can 
unwittingly change the radio or CD."

new I35 - and never got out that car, 
keep driving it day in-day out - so 
much fun is this baby to drive... On

infiniti,i35,2003,NJ Driver, 01/20/2003,Infiniti I35,4,"This is a wonderful car.  I've had it
now for a little over 1 month.
Acceleration is excellent with the 3.5 L
V-6, FAST! The suspension is a little
stiff but not overly so.  Subsequently
handles well, with little body roll,
even without the sport suspension.
Interior is very comfortable with very
supple leather seats.  Back is much
roomier than the G35.

After test driving nearly every vehicle on the market I found the I35 to fit all criteria: power, safety, reliability, comfort, look and value. While sitting in any car for 15 hours straight is painful, the I35 was a pleasure to drive. I got 29.3 mpg averaging 58 mph (traffic slowed me down). Phenominal numbers for any V6 engine. If you can find one of these, it's as good as any new car at half the price. I am now an Infiniti customer."

Outstanding, powerful Bose stereo with AM/FM with RDS, cassette, and 6-disc CD changer with 7 speakers (including a 9-inch Bose woofer) and automatic speed-volume control that compensates for road noise.

Otherwise, it's a great car for the money.  The extra features can not be found on any other car for the money.  Gas mileage is so-so, but trade-off for the high HP.  Have had brakes replaced, but I do mostly city driving.  Had a G35 loaner (sticker $44,000) and I hated it. No extra features. This is a much better value. If you can find a used one coming off lease - BUY IT!!  The G35 is aimed a t a much younger demographic.  I am 48 - female."

Concierge-style Infiniti dealer service experience, separate from, and a definite cut above, the norm.  Benefits from the well-known Nissan reliability, but with the sturdiest parts in the bin, being basically a more upscale Maxima.  Soft, supple leather interior.  Tremendous navigation system for the time period (bird's-eye view a big plus), though Nation-wide coverage depends on purchase of separate (expensive) discs for differing multi-State ""zones"" if you're looking to travel cross-country.  Other than routine maintenance and normal-wear items such as tires, windshield wipers, battery, etc., the ownership experience has been FLAWLESS.  Stability Control keeps the car rock-stable in wet or icy conditions.  Body integrity remains perfect: zero rust after 12-plus years.  Athletic body stance, though not as ""sexy"" as (say) a BMW -FAR offset by the EXTREMELY minimal cost of upkeep.  Tip: Buy the best all-season tires you can afford (ie. Bridgestone Turanza's worked well for me), as I noticed a definite difference in handling when ""good rubber"" was in evidence (never unpleasant, but downright smile-inducing when better).

There's only one glitch so far - an irritating rattle in the dash when going over expansion strips or sharp bumps. Other than that it's clear that Infiniti seriously believes in the concept of continuous improvement. For the same money as my '97, I have a much more substantial car with more features, better quality, better safety and some serious grunt off the line.

It's a big cushy ride with a huge interior and trunk, a monster of a 3.6 liter engine that goes like a bat out of hell. Only con is the mileage but all of the Nissan 3.6 liter engines are beasts and don't get good mileage. Otherwise, the car has been flawless.

beautiful in fit and finish.

The breaking and suspension of the car 
are superior as is the steering. 
Turning radius seems a little bit 
limited but that's a small feature for 
us.

have read that the OEM Bridgestone

car to drive, plenty of power, 
relatively good mileage. I question 
whether I should have bought a G35

anything bad about the car.  Its been

The Mazda handled much better but the JX feels more refined.
I also have a G35 and the JX is far from handling expectations for Infiniti which is becoming more disappointing after living with the car.
It is quiet, I do like the CVT especially after 3500RPM, milage is good, lots of great tech, and great entry to 3rd row without massive rear doors.
Build quality has not been great. In 2 months, had multiple rattles, had loose trim, and now the HVAC fan is making noise.
Overall I give it a B.
Not sure i would do it again now that the honeymoon period is wearing off.
Bottom line-- test drive it multiple times before signing the papers."

The emerald paint is a deep metallic rich, subtly changing hue in different lights. The java interior is beautiful, as well as very comfortable.
There is plenty of interior room, including headroom. 3rd row seat is low, but roomy. The floor is level throughout, and plenty of visibility all around. The controls are well placed. This car is clearly designed for quiet and comfort.
By design, it does not have the same performance & handling of other Infinitis. But, loads of tech!"

We really liked the safety features, but the loaners don't always have them and we spent just too much time in service.

The airbag would turn off while someone was seated in it. The Infiniti dealer in Fresno wasn't able to fix it, they gave us multiple excuses from ""it's working as designed"" to ""your not sitting in it correctly"". What a crock!! The transmission failed at 59K miles which was covered under warranty although the new transmission only came with a 12K mile warranty. The wipers would come on whenever the felt like it. The weather stripping for the rear doors would regularly fall off. What topped it all off was the service advisor recommending that we not keep the car past 100K miles! The advisor told my wife that he had looked into buying a JX35 for his wife but opted to buy a Honda due to reliability issues. So last Saturday (7/9/16), was my second best day of JX35 ownership, I sold it! I will never own another Infiniti product ever!

The interior is very plush and roomy. It looks and feels high end. The second row moves about 5 inches fwd/aft, which is a great feature-more leg room. Unlike most of the SUVs in this class, the third row is useful. A 6 ft. adult can sit back there comfortably. Infact, it's just as comfortable as the 3rd row seat on the QX56.

It's silent and all the features work great. My wife can't be happier. I'ts her daily driver. The trany is fine too.

We only had the vehicle about 3-4 weeks when it started to exhibit major front end shaking/steering issues when operating the vehicle between 18-35 MPH.
 This is a highly unsafe situation which could very easily result in the driver losing control of the vehicle.
At this point this brand new vehicle has been to the dealership twice (currently there) for a total of 21+ days and has had major power train work done or currently scheduled.
This includes replacement of the Torque Converter, Electric Power Steering Unit and they are actively working to replace the transmission with a re-manufactured unit."

infiniti,jx,2013,dgc3043, 08/04/2012,Very functional car that is fun to drive,4,"Downsizing from a loaded Ford Expedition I wanted similar functionality in a vehicle that was more city friendly/drove like a car.
At 6'7"" with 2 kids still in the house I was very impressed with the flexibility of the JX.
With the driver's seat fully adjusted for me and my 38"" inseam, a large adult can sit comfortably behind me.
Mid sized adults can realistically fit in the 3rd row.
Not as much cargo room as the Expedition but significantly more than what you would think--car looks smaller on the outside but is quite cavernous on the inside.
The vehicle drives very nice; I crave silence on the freeway and the JX is quiet at speed, absorbs bumps well, has solid acceleration and braking."
infiniti,jx,2013,beagle11, 04/01/2012,First Impressions,4,"Just took delivery of our emerald graphite JX35 AWD (fully loaded) with java brown interior.
My first impressions are as follows:

Appearance:

As attractive as the JX35 appears in the photos, the vehicle looks even better in person.
The exterior styling is very sporty without looking gimmicky.
The dark plastic aeroskirts and underbody accents compliment the lines well.
While the salesman admitted he was skeptical of the java interior with the dark gray dash and emerald graphite color scheme when we pre-ordered, but was very impressed when it was delivered.
The dark brown leather looks very luxurious and breaks up what would be a monochromatic look.
Its definitely one of the smartest looking SUVs on the road today. 

Performance:

 The engine is adequate and the ride is more luxurious than it is sporty. For 90% of drivers in this class, it will perform admirably.
Plows quite bit into the turns, but this isn&#146;t a M series. 

Interior:

Top notch interior.
Seats are firm, but comfortable.
I am a large guy over 6 feet, and I can fit in all three rows. The 3rd row would be tough for long periods, but doable for less than an hour.
The 3rd row access entry space is big enough for an adult to gain access within to much trouble. 

Technology:

It may take a year or more to get your hands around all of the features.
The basic functions are intuitive, but like a really powerful smart phone, the vehicles capabilities likely far exceed the users mastery of the systems functionality.
The steering wheel controls are reversed from most vehicles, and the different interfaces will take a little while to familiarize myself with being a distraction.


Non-Critical, but Quirky Issues:

Due to the push-button keyless ignition, there doesnt appear to be a way to energize the vehicle control systems within starting the vehicle first.
There doesnt appear to be a way to roll up and down windows, or play radio like you would with a vehicle in accessory mode with a traditional turn-key ignition.


There is a very poorly placed SOS button for the Infiniti Connect emergency notification system.
The button is located on the overhead control panel, approximately ½-inch below the button for the driver-side overhead lamp.
When the headlines are engaged, the button is back-lighted, but is easily confused with the overhead light switch in the dark.
Yes, I pushed it accidentally on the first evening I drove the car. The response came from Infiniti in approximately 30 seconds and the call center representative was thankfully very understanding.

While the odds of changing a tire yourself is remote with roadside assistance, the rear Bose Direct-Wave speaker and plastic rear hatch liner would need o be removed prior to accessing the under-body high pressure spare tire and jack.


Remote start will not work with second key located inside of within close proximity of the vehicle.
Once the second key was removed from the car, it started right up.


While the DVD playing in the back can be viewed on the front heads-up monitor, the car must be stopped and the emergency break engaged before it will come up.


No CD changer, but rather a hard drive storage system where you can burn hundreds on CDs onto prior to leaving.
Unclear if the burn function works with audio books.


Overall:

I think Acura is going to have to re-design the MDX this year to match the JX35 main buying demographic.
The bar has been raised in that price class.
While not perfect and bordering on being too technologically complex, the JX35 hits or exceeds expectations for factors that matter to the 40-something $100K+ income female."
infiniti,jx,2013,granolla, 04/21/2013,Not So Great...,1,"I drove the JX for 25000 miles, the  lack of acceleration and the odd workings of the CVT I could not take.
The JX struggles.. If you have not driven a vehicle with a CVT transmission Do Your Homework. It is awkward compared to a traditional transmission. The engine will rev at times unexpected ,it is much louder, and you get the feeling of downshifting. They give you a selector switch that you can turn to sport mode to make it feel like a traditional transmission (not).  I had actually called infinity a few times regarding the odd reving and the feel of this.  They told me no one had complained, i couldnt believe it.  I have driven so many cars and suv's in my time , this was the first I ever sold back at a loss..  The odd thing was the following year the only change they made was to reprogram the transmission to feel like a conventional transmission.  i cant believe they did that just for me......Understanding it is SUV/ crossover, it does not take to turns well comparable. Bottom line at this price It underperforms.  They need to either really improve those transmissions or go a diffrent direction. It does not belong in there.  Would take my CX9 Back tomorrow.
"
infiniti,jx,2013,rraffel, 07/16/2013,CVT Transmission is this car's downfall,3,"We bought the JX as the family car.
Loved the third row, and the fact that we did not have to take the car seat out to get to the third row.
Also, even with the seats up, there was a small trunk.
The interior room is great, especially in the rear.
However, between the terrible CVT transmission, and the poor gas mileage, I doubt I would buy this again.
This isn't a performance car by any stretch, but don't want it to be.
However, there are times it barely gets out of its own way - this I blame on the transmission as it seems to be constantly hunting for the best ""gear"".
Just makes it uncomfortable to drive.
As for gas mileage, we are around 15... far below what we expected."
infiniti,jx,2013,jostajtf, 07/31/2013,Do NOT buy this vehcile,1,"BEWARE...do NOT buy a vehicle from Infiniti. They are crooks! I bought a 2013 JX35. Within the 1st 100 miles we noticed the transmission was having problems. Everyone at Infiniti told us that we need to break in the car for 500 miles and that the car has a CVT transmission. Finally we got tired of the transmission continually jerking around and grinding between 10-35 mph and we brought it in. After 9 days in the shop they finally said they need to replace the torque converter. Done. After we picked up the vehicle, the car was doing the same thing as before, yet worse. Back to the dealer, same day. Finally we are told that they need to replace the transmission. Totally unacceptable. Infiniti "
infiniti,jx,2013,icc2012, 12/22/2012,Poor fuel economy,3,"I've been driving the car for about 500 miles and I get under 12 mpg combined highway/city in Sport mode. What is even more outrageous is that if I drive in normal or eco mode all I get is under 9 mpg. Is this other owners experience or this particular vehicle has an issue? Planning to take it back to dealership to check what's going on.

Also, sometimes the satellite radio reception in poor? Anybody else having this issue?"
infiniti,jx,2013,George Milev, 08/26/2017,Pretends to be a luxury SUV but doesn't deliver,1,"Bought the Infinity JX35 in 2013 brand new. The car has had 4 recalls already (took 3 tries to fix one of those - passenger's air bag module). It's a gas guzzler in city driving. The CV transmission is non-responsive and sluggish. The supposed All Wheel drive is fake. It's a two wheel drive on the 4WD model with an option to activate the 4WD in a snow mode drive only. And then the rear wheels operate  only at 50%. The radiator fan motor went out at 34K miles, but somehow the warranty doesn't cover it and the dealership is charging me $1,300 for the repair. When you buy a car for $50K, you'd expect for the car not to start falling you at 34K miles. Engine began overheating because of the broken fan motor. It's comfy inside and the 3rd row seat (which is for kids or dogs only) ocasionally comes handy, but that's the only good thing I can say about it. Nissan, which makes the Infinity, has a 5 year bumper to bumper warranty on a truck/van (the NV 200). Makes me wonder why they don’t have the same warranty for a “luxury” SUV
"
infiniti,jx,2013,Adam stein, 06/25/2018,"Great Value, hard to beat",4,"Bought used with 30k miles. Now we have 80k trouble free miles. We bought fully loaded including TVs for the kids. Upgraded to this when we had twins from EX35. 
Did the whole Acura MDX, Infiniti JX35 comparison. We needed something with 3 rows in case grandparents came along and we needed plenty of space for the twins stuff. My wife didn’t feel comfortable driving something as large as a Tahoe/Yukon and Lexus only offered 3 rows on a truck based platform with a stupidly designed 3rd row that flipped up to the side and chewed up valuable cargo space. 
After test driving both Acura and Infiniti we realized the Infiniti is significantly larger, offered a nicer cabin (in our opinion) and rode more comfortably. 
4 years and nearly 50k miles later, we are just as happy as when we first bought it. No major mechanical issues. Reliability has been top notch, although I understand that reliability has not been Infiniti’s strong suit as of late, we have been lucky on our JX. The interior has held up extremely well considering my twins have given it all they’ve got.  
Now we’ve just added a 3rd kid and with 3 kids in car seats, we need to upgrade in size. Having to utilize the 3rd row for a car seat crushes car or capacity. I had to rent a suburban to take the family on a week long road trip. 
Pros: reliability, looks, interior design, navigation and electronics, cargo capacity (3rd row folded), ride

Cons: underpowered and fuel economy is atrocious. Averaging 15.2 mpg over 50k miles. CVT transmission is so -so and completely not necessary if mileage is that bad. 

I would highly recommend this to anyone with 2 young kids. "

""Just for fun"" I test drove the JX. The rest is history. I absolutely love this car. Had it one month and find excuses to drive it. 

I very much like the transmission choices. I use the sport mode when starting off and then depending on whether I'm on local roads or an interstate, shift the knob accordingly. While in eco drive I have already managed 24.6 MPG.

I also find it much easier to drive than the MDX. My seating position gives me a better view of the road and the ride itself is smooth, quit and just plain relaxing."
infiniti,jx,2013,andy0416, 08/29/2013,JX Passenger Airbag Does Not Work,2,"This car has a major design defect that Infiniti is ignoring.
All passenger airbags are supposed to operate if the person in the seat weighs more than 110 pounds.
My wife weighs 118 poounds and is 5 feet 4 inches tall.
The airbag does not detect that she is in the seat and therefore is not operational.
The dealer tried to fix the problem but could not.
They reported to Infiniti that they verified the problem and that it was a dangerous condition.
Infiniti has simply ignored the defect. As a result I was forced to bring a lemon law suit against them.
There are mumerous other complaints. Be warned that if you have a loved one who weighs about 120 or less the passenger airbag wont work!"

infiniti,jx,2013,obie1974, 07/08/2012,Under Priced Luxury Car,5,"I don't get excited about cars these days but have really enjoyed the JX more than any other car I've owned or driven. My wife and I were considering purchasing a new luxury car next year and after research, narrowed down to the new M Class and the X5. We never considered Infiniti until we saw a teaser ad. After thourough research, I was at the Infiniti dealership the day it arrived.
This car had more features and plenty of room for passengers than anything we've looked at. It has more than enough power. It has the best CVT we've driven. All the technology works great. The car practically drives itself. Great family our touring car. Test drive the car yourself rather than relying on reviews."
infiniti,jx,2013,AZ Jon, 06/04/2018,2013 Infiniti JX35 - 95K Miles & we give up,2,"Bought brand new and a short review after owning for 95K miles.  Up to 80K miles the JX35 was reliable.  As others have noted, the transmission is sluggish/underpowered, constant issue/recalls with passenger side airbag, and the gas mileage is horrible - we average about 17 MPG in the city and 19/20 highway.  Key concerns up to 80k miles:  1. Replaced battery 4 times in 5 years with terminals connectors having been replaced twice, 2. Door mouldings routinely come apart making car noisy with lots of squeaks, 3. Driver and passenger visors repeatedly break ($200 each to replace at dealer) due to cheap parts, 4. Tiny driver kickplate led to hole in interior floor carpet and the dealer wanted $1,100 to repair, 5.  Brakes have short lifespan 25k to 30k and need replaced; dealer quotes $375 for front pads - outrageous.   6. Terrible dealer support/lack of warranty support - Infiniti of Scottsdale, AZ is the worst.  The service ""advisors"" almost appeared to be gleeful as they told us repeatedly that another issue with the vehicle was not covered under warranty during the supposed 4 year/60K warranty period.    

Between 80K and 95K miles is when we started having costly mechanical issues.  AC died on us - $1,200 repair.  Fuel pump needed replaced - another $1K repair.  Two engine mounts needed replaced - another costly repair.  We gave up at 95K miles and got rid of the JX35.  

All said, this is truly not a luxury vehicle - just buy the Pathfinder and save $10k-$15K.  Or, if you truly want a reliable ""luxury"" vehicle go with Lexus or maybe Acura.   NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE INFINITI JX35.
"
infiniti,jx,2013,Chi, 03/21/2020,Luxurious Family Hauler,3,"Purchased a 2013 Infiniti JX as soon as it was introduced to the market in 2012, so I ‘ve had a good 8 years or so to form a comprehensive opinion on this crossover. Beginning with styling, it is a handsome and uniquely styled vehicle with nice proportions in my subjective opinion. There are flowing body contours and an interesting D-pillar design that imparts a sporty and sleek appearance similar to the FX/QX70. 

Despite its sloping roofline, the JX has pretty decent cargo room in the rear with the third row up and the size of the vehicle is not too small or too big relative to others in its class. Although the third row is fairly tight, it is not as small as others such as the MDX or Q7, and even taller adults will be fine in the back for short periods of time. The second row has a good amount of adjustment, but it does sit slightly too low and is relatively flat. The second row tilts and moves forward to provide a good amount of entry into the third row. First row seats have a nice stitching pattern with piping and are wide and comfortable. The interior of the JX is luxurious with high quality leather and wood and a nice cohesive dash design with metallic accents. There are, however, noticeably cheaper materials used for the upper dash and lower door parts and the leather on the steering wheel feels cheap. Additionally, the navigation interface is pretty outdated and basic even for a 2013 model. 

In terms of performance, it not as fun to drive or as performance oriented as other Infinitis or even other three row luxury SUVs such as MDX or Q7. The VQ engine is quiet, smooth and sounds good under acceleration. It provides decent power for regular day to day driving, however during aggressive acceleration, the CVT tends to rev high but not put the power down as much as I’d like. This CVT is decent but is not as responsive as a traditional automatic. Steering is on the lighter side for my tastes and lacks a good amount of feel, however body roll and handling abilities are decent for the size of vehicle. The brakes are strong and have good feel. I do not use eco mode because it increases the gas pedal resistance too much, while sport mode does not feel that different from normal mode.
Where the JX shines is comfort. The interior is very quiet, and the vehicle feels very stable even during highway speeds of 80/90 mph. The ride is smooth and absorbs impacts and bad road surfaces well without being too soft or mushy. It is especially good at being a highway cruiser, but fuel economy has been slightly disappointing (around 16 mpg). Especially for a 2013 model, safety technology was a strong suit for the JX. The model I opted for comes with blind spot monitoring, backup sensors, backup camera, backup collision intervention and forward collision assist. Additional items such as height adjustable headlights, a 360-degree camera, power steering wheel and illuminated exterior door handles add a nice touch of luxury and convenience. 

Although the vehicle is now 8 years old, there are no rattles or squeaks inside. There were slight build quality issues in the first year of ownership such as trim coming off in the third row and seatbacks, one of the sliding seat mechanisms failing to work (fixed under warranty), and the under floor storage cover not closing properly. Other than that, it has remained trouble-free mechanically. However, recently on rare occasions there is a slight shudder under acceleration at low RMPS. This is disconcerting considering the reliability history of these transmissions. Although it isn’t doesn’t have the driving dynamics of the Q7 and MDX, we chose the JX because it was a good value being several thousand dollars cheaper. Overall, the JX does have some significant shortcomings, but it is a good option if you are looking for a roomy, comfortable and luxurious three row crossover.

We have a Nissan truck that cost almost $30k less, and it drives like a champ. My car is 3 years old, and we have already had to replace the transmission- which cost an additional $5300. Nothing on this vehicle can be serviced by a mechanic, everything must come from the dealer. The bluetooth barely works, we can never get the DVD player to work, the GPS is inaccurate, and had routed me to a 2-track jeep trail that almost killed me, I even busted my wheel bearing going down this road trying to stay alive. The service department is great and very helpful, and the car is comfortable. The cruise control is awesome, but for $55,000, I will never make this purchase again. We have spent more time in the shop with this vehicle than any other vehicle, even ones that we bought pre-owned. A new transmission with only a 12,000 mile warranty is unacceptable.

We had it in a couple times to have transmission checked. At 2000 miles beyond warranty period they had it a week due to stuttering. Initially they said they would put a new tranny in and cover it under warranty, but later in week they decided not necessary —- but they would note it in the records in case it acts up again. Well, transmission completely failed a couple months later while on vacation a 1000 miles away from home. We contacted Infiniti and they were completely unwilling to consider replacing tranny  under warranty or even splitting the cost or discounting the repair. Estimate exceeded $5000 and 2 weeks..

infiniti,jx,2013,Erika K., 05/07/2016,Great Overall!,4,"I bought this car blindly without test driving so overall I am happy. However after reading other reviews and driving it for 2 months I can agree with them on some issues. For example, the acceleration is very disappointing but it helps that I have controls to switch to sport if I want to go faster because on ECO it goes at a snails pace. The controls for radio, air and phone are to far spaced and as a female my hands do not fit in the little compartment to charge my phone. The aux cord in the console is in the most awkward spot and is difficult to access. The Bluetooth rarely works correctly which is very annoying. We also have the entertainment/tech package and the way he dvd system works is also awkward with too many steps just to watch a dvd. My car is still under warranty  and the leader in the back seat is splitting and spreading, I eager to see if Infinity  will do anything about it. Also l, the look of the vehicle is pretty much s station wagon so I wish it was more stylish. On the bright side it is roomy and the 3rd row is easily accessible and my husband or 14yr old son can sit comfortably back there. Overall it's a good value and recommend to others.

After taking it for repair, the shop informed me that they fixed the problem.
The problem recurred again and this time they informed me that they had to remove the dash to fix the problem.
The car has been back for repair five times for the same issue without addressing the problem successfully.
My efforts to have the manufacturer buy back have been fruitless.
This car is a a disappointment and the customer service is very poor.
This is not what I expected after spending so much much for a luxury car.

I have to qualify my review by letting you know that my wife loves this car and its by far her favorite family car that we've owned.
The JX is packed with technology and is quite a good looking car.
Its very well thought out and the design and tech features are very intuitive. The performance of the car is another story.
By 2013 standards this car is simply underpowered.
The constant drone of the CVT as is searches/skips gears is annoying to say the least.
Infiniti should take their ""mulligan"" and come out with an upgraded engine and ditch the CVT for 2014"

I purchased my truck from an Infiniti dealership. And have had constant repairs done buy a different infiniti dealership. Long story short: I’ve owned it for almost two years. I’ve put thousands of dollars into it “fixing” things that shouldn’t ever fall apart. At 6 years of age it has under 75,000 miles and has cost me more than any other vehicle I’ve ever owned. Most of them didn’t start to fall apart until 150,000+ miles. This is our second and last infiniti. The other one was a G35x that also fell apart. Just walk away or prepare to lose big with infiniti.
Update: still putting big money into repairs and regular “maintenance”. No longer taking vehicles to dealership. Getting rid of both infinities and never buying again. The worst.

We are leasing it so this review is based upon a fully loaded model (every package, MSRP was $58k). I will say it is a perfect, flat-land cruiser for mom.
I love the interior design and appointments.
The exterior, i think, is the most flaterring - GMC, Acura, Honda & Toyota all just look the same; the JX has style.
We live in 'moderate hills' in the SF Bay Area and the JX really stinks on the gas milage - we avg 14 mpg.
Also backing up the driveway is very sluggish, must be the CVT.
My wife says ""it's just not peppy and seems sluggish"" however once on the flats it's fine."

infiniti,jx,2013,j4kofnova, 03/06/2013,Great technology and comfortable but lacking a heart...,3,"Have spent a great deal of time behind the wheel of JX in comparison to Audi Q7. First off, hands down the JX has better technology (love the BCI!) than the Q7, and much move functional 3rd row. The JX is a great alternative to a mini-van if don't want that look, need the 3rd row and don't want the heft and size of a Armada/Yukon XL/QX56 type. From this perspecive it is much better than Q7.

With that being said here is why I feel the JX falls waaaay short of the Q7. First, the JX feels sluggish and the CVT transmission never seems comfortable in gear. Takes alot of patience to get going. Second, Infiniti's packaging is bizarre. Why do I have to get the theater package to get 20"" wheels? "

We got fwd (I know should of got all wheel but it's drives just fine) with premium, divers assistance theater pkg. At first we took a look and drove the 2013 pathfinder which the Nissan dealer told us it's the Same thing as the jx. Well it's different. Not to mention the pathfinder interior is plastic fantastic!

This car is AWESOME!! I never thought a car could have so many luxurious amenities..
Had a decked out 2010 RAV-4 before this one. There is just no contest. The JX rides extemely smoothly. The pit holes and bumps on the road that I could feel everyday going to and from work in my old car, are just not there anymore.
Would absolutely recommend this baby to any family. Its price is very competitive with features that I don't

I handles very well on windy roads, gets excellent gas milage for a V6 (24-26 mpg why), but most of all the technology incorporated into the fully loaded JX is awesome.

The warranty was 12000 miles or 12 months. its been exactly one month out of warranty and the service department is making me pay $900 for one headlight BUT not giving me a warranty on the new repair and was told that they will no longer repair my vehicle after they fix it. They are a""assuming"" that I am causing the issue due to ""environmental reasons"" or too many car washes because they've NEVER had this issue before and they can't give me a factual reason on why they keep going out every winter. And to top it off the service manager laughed asked me why did I buy an Infiniti if I work for chrysler? Which isn't any of his business and super uncalled for being that he work for the company.  Ive read other complaints online about the headlights holding moisture I'm shocked they haven't recalled this problem but I'm sure they won't being that it cost $3500/$4000 to replace with labor.

I have seen some reviews for the hybrid and some are better than others.
In general, i really like this car and I am fairly picky about cars.
I have only had it a few days, but from what I can tell, it is a big upgrade from a performance and technology standpoint from my 2007 Lexus.
 Nothing wrong with the Lexus and it was a great car, but the Infinity has a much tighter feel, better performance, better infotainment and better sound system.
Not to mention better performance if you want it or better gas mileage if you want it."
infiniti,m,2012,Mikeymatts16, 01/08/2016,Dont follow the crowd and drop the BMW dream !,5,"Just bought a certified 2012 Infiniti 37x AWD off lease a few months ago and honestly it is the best decision I made. After looking at lower than expected consumer ratings for BMW, Audi A6's minimum $5,000 more price tag and Lexus ES350's nice but favorite drive of gray haired folks, I gave Infiniti a try and honestly I couldn't be happier. The overall value of the car is bar none the best out of all mid-sized luxury models. As a previous Maxima owner, I was looking for a more luxurious but sporty vehicle that doesn't look like a Nissan Altima and this car must be seen and driven in person. The performance is a mix of both BMW and Acura, while the cabin's interior cannot be compared to anything but Lexus all with all wheel drive with the bells and whistles to boot. The body will grow on you and the best part is the car is that it's uncommon and looks 100% better than the previous and more box-y M35. Once you consider the high ownership costs of a German car and reliability of Nissan/Infiniti, you will hopefully come to your senses and seriously consider the M37.

All of the materials feel wonderful (I got the Premium and Deluxe Touring packages, which add a little to the experience). It is whisper quiet, has LOADS of power, and an amazing array of gizmos. In searching, I ended up visiting dealerships in two different states, and they were both really great. I bought it at Cochran Infiniti in Pittsburgh, and they include a pick-up service where they'll drop off a loaner Infiniti and take your car to service (even though we live 80 miles away!)."
infiniti,m,2012,James Beavan, 05/20/2016,2012 Infiniti M35h,5,"I bought this car off of a lease with 19,000 miles on it and have put about 23,000 miles on it myself.  It has been problem free, just basic maintenance, no other issues.  This is a good looking car stock and even better looking after I added a few tasteful mod's (legal tinted windows/20"" staggered black & chrome wheels/chrome door post pillar's/chrome tinted window vent visors/chrome mesh upper and lower front grill mesh inserts/rear factory deck lid spoiler and LED fog lights.  Maybe due to the tires or that I only use 87 octane gas, but even in moderate mixed driving I don't get close to the EPA 29 MPG, more like 26-27 when calculated by hand, the trip computer over estimates my MPG by about 1.5-2 MPG on average.  The only other issue I have sometimes the traction control is funny when making a turn from a stop, it will kick in and not allow you to accelerate.  I love the interior layout and the car drives great and has a nice sound system and easy to use control panel.  Being a hybrid the trunk isn't long, but it is deep enough to hold plenty of groceries or 2 golf bags.  It's nice driving a car that has a unique look with its contoured hood and beautiful lines.

infiniti,m,2012,Robert, 01/19/2017,Does not comare to German Cars,3,"Bought this after reading reviews . I also liked the increase in HP. Owned BMW for past 10 yrs - two 3 series cars.  This car cannot hold the road on curves. With the great hp - cornering needs to improve.  I have driven 5 series BMW as well (same size as the M) and they hold the road. The blue tooth decides when to work or not work, phone is always connecting and disconnecting.  If you get a call when its acting up, it will lock your phone up.  Stereo system is terrible. All the speakers rattle, dealer said it is a common problem. They attempted to fix but to no use. I do not blast my radio at all.  The auto seat back and steering wheel raise upon exit will just stop working and in a few days start working again - no i did not turn off the feature. For straight open roads it does very well, except you cannot set the cruise control when going over 85 - I live in Texas the speed limits in West Texas are 85. The navigation system is not user friendly,to many screens to go through to set destination. The voice system is not much help. It""s just easier to use my phone.  The car looks nice, I have the Malbec black - it looks great in the sunlight.  The seats are big and comfy and the heat and cooling work quickly.  I just expected better handling and sound system. My son's Ford Fiesta sounds better than this.  Needless to say i wont by another Infiniti.  To those saying they compare to BMW, but you have not owned one or driven one for more than a day or two - don't tell people that. They do not compare.

infiniti,m,2013,ooty74, 05/22/2015,CUDOS to INFINITI - they got it right!,5,"After almost 3 years of ownership I am  very pleased with my Infiniti M37 Sport (now called Q70). It's beautiful, I've had NO mechanical problems and it's a blast to drive. CONSUMER REPORTS was right when they recommended it over the MB E350 and the BMW 5's for 4 straight years (2011-2015). Unlike other car magazines that publish reviews based on the advertising they receive from car manufacturers CONSUMER REPORTS bases their evaluation on 50 objective tests.  The M37  is so dependable that it's recommended as a used luxury car by CR. It's a perfect blend of  reliability, performance and luxury. Before  I bought the M37 I drove both the Mercedes E350 2 door Sport and BMW 5 series. I was not impressed. Both offered cachet names but not much else for the high price. The BMW was not the BMW of my father's generation. The handling was lackluster and the interior was high grade plastic and vinyl (seats). The MB E350 sport was small,had a VERY rough ride and the seats were VERY uncomfortable. Like the BMW the interior was a mixture of plastic and vinyl (leatherette?). IMHO these cars are unacceptable for the $60,00.00 list price. By contrast the M37 Sport was exactly the car that CONSUMER REPORT predicted it would be. The Infiniti was VERY, VERY AGILE and handled much better than the cachet names. The seats were not vinyl but were beautifully double stitched leather. Also the ride was surprisingly better than the more expensive Mercedes E350 sport. Infiniti got it right when they designed this car. I'm very pleased with the M37. I've gotten many complements on my car. It does evoke an unsolicited ""WOW"" response from many people and I do catch a number of TESLA owners gazing at my car. I've been down to the dealership earlier this year and saw the new version of the M37. It's apparently the same car with new body work. A very handsome design.
Conclusion: don't place your trust solely in  car magazine/car website reviews. I have purchased many cars over the past 30 years based my decisions on CR's recommendations and have never been disappointed ...... my advise do a lot of reading and do some driving

I looked at the E350, Lexus GS sport and the BMW 5 series but bought the M37 based on it's performance (0-60 in 5 sec), beauty (looks like a Maserati-Jag hybrid w/muscle) and solid reliability (due to it's low repair cost it's recommended as a used car).

I have the Sport and Premium Packages, making this my perfect blend of luxury and sport. I'd consider myself an enthusiast-level driver and appreciate the go-fast bits. While the G37 may be more sports car-like, the M37 has plenty of grunt and feels next-level upscale, matching an A6, 5 Series, E Class, etc. This car has seen extensive snow, having easily traversed at least 7 inches worth multiple times."

We rescued our Obsidian Black, 2013 M37xS from three feet of snow.  We drove the 100 miles home in complete confidence, yet another snowstorm, in the sure footed AWD traction.  While we dislike the low profile tires, noisy for old people (didn't see those in the three feet of snow) the acceleration, handling and sheer pleasure of driving more than makes up for it's lack of quiet.  We are in month 29 of a 39 month lease and will likely get another Infiniti but unsure of which model.  The downsides of this uniquely sporty model M are: mileage/gas costs, rims that every curb attacks, complicated navigation system, no 360 camera like the '14 Q50 had.

I didn't/don't have a ton of discretionary $ - So the $1600-$1700 for the extended warranty was a hard pill to swallow - Especially for my wife - But we ""found"" the $.

Have MORE than recouped the $ invested (both frt. wheel bearings, CD plyr)"
infiniti,m35,2006,Jimmy, 01/24/2009,"Reliable car, packed with great features",5,"Bought this car brand new years ago and it's been a great car so far.  When shopping for this car we compared it to the bmw 5 series and the lexus gs.  This car has more features, more space, and lower cost. We wanted to stay below 50k, but have navigation, rear view camera, push button start, HID lights, and ventilated memory seats. This car was the best deal and we don't feel we sacrificed on looks or design. The interior is smart and the exterior looks sharp.  The V6 sounds great when you floor it.  So far, 73k, the car hasn't had any issues, however, the Infiniti maintenance is expensive."
infiniti,m35,2006,Eric, 10/08/2015,A true sleeper car.,5,"I have an 06 M35 Sport and love it. It handles like a true sports car. At 100+ mph it feel like it is on rails. The ride is a little stiffer of course but that is what the Sport edition is for. Fuel economy average is around 21 which is fine for this car. Seating is comfortable and roomy. It has 120K miles and still drives like it has 10K. If you are looking for a 4 door sedan that drives and handles like a sports car not sure you could go wrong with any of the Infiniti line up.

Car now has 168K miles and still runs great. Only issues I have had is headliner has dropped in the rear of the car, replaced water pump (regular maintenance), and the engine uses a little oil. The oil issue is common with those engine. Still enjoy driving the car.

infiniti,m35,2006,StillaYankee, 10/08/2010,"Reliable, Fun To Drive",4,"After having to finally give up my 94 Q45a 2 years ago I searched for months for a car that would fill the void.  Had my heart set on a GS but a dealer recommendation convinced me on the M35 Sport and I'm so glad he did.  The car handles great, the ride is reasonably quiet (probably quieter than most reviews but you can hear the tires when the radio isn't on) and the power is amazing for a 6 cylinder.  I do wish they had added an extra gear or 2 like others have commented as getting the same mileage as my 10 year old Q wasn't expected.  If I just travel on the Interstate I can squeeze out 21-22 mpg if I drive like my wife.  Don't expect more than 20-25k on the tires."
infiniti,m35,2006,Tom, 03/05/2005,Eye opener,5,"I drove and considered a group in this catagory including BMW 5, Audi A6, Cadillac CTS, Lexus GS300. All were the 6 cylander versions. The Cadillac was out immediately, poor interior and performance during the test drive. The Audi, BMW, and Lexus all drove and preformed in a similiar fasion. I especially liked the interior of the Audi A6. The overall package, including absolute fun to drive, technology, and ""bells and whistles for the dollar"" went hands down to the Infiniti. I am a previous BMW 535 owner and present '04, Z4 owner, and now an Infiniti M35 owner and lovin it."
infiniti,m35,2006,Barry Bienen, 10/20/2006,"Nice car, lousy service",4,"Beautiful design. Ride and handling couldn't be any better. Car rides and handles like a little limousine. The features are bountiful and useful if only they worked. The nicest feature, the blue tooth phone went from virtually unusable due to an echo to not working at all. Had massive fight with dealer service who says it is supposed to be this way. No sense in having it if it does not work. Loaner car was filthy and our car returned unfixed with grease stains on driver's seat and center console."

Passenger side power mirror not working, one power window not working and some of the dashboard lights intermittently come off and on. "

infiniti,m35,2006,MJ, 09/13/2006,Great Car,4,"Traded in a 2004 Acura TL for the M35 Sport. Major upgrade! The styling, ride and blend of luxury and performance is well balanced. The ride is smooth, especially considering the 19"" rims and tires. Everyone compliments the car from my sportcar loving friends to the non-car person.  I test drove and compare the M35 to the GS 300, MB E350 and 300M and the Infiniti was the winner hands down. When making my decision weighing the pros and cons of each the M35 Sport won in almost every category. The only negative was my concern with gas mileage after reading the reviews prior to purchasing, which to my disappointment is reality. With that said, I would still highly recommend the M."

My heart was set on a Mercedes e-class but it did not compare to the M at all. It was love at first sight, it seemed when I sat in the drivers' seat it hugged me. The features are endless, the appearance is flawless. This flagship is the envy on the road."

Decided to give it a chance and fell in love. Wanted AWD, so 6 cyl was only option. With Journey package and nav as the extras. Similiar MB and BMW were 8-10K more. Lexus was softer ride. Acura couldn't compete with the handling of this car. Audi was closest in price and amenities. Never thought I would buy an infiniti because of resale value in past. I know that the G and FX have improved I hope that the M does as well. Only have 400 miles on car and am very happy so far. With 18"" tires it soaks up the bumps fairly well. Will try to lower tire pressure to see if it softens ride "

GM helped me look around at others...BMW, LexusGS, all 3 Caddys, and Chrysler300 as well as the new Saab9-5. None compared favorably with the M to me, The M was also the best lease deal at 25k/yr by far! This M is absolutely the finest sports sedan I've ever been driven! 7 months and 15k, and not one regret!"

This car has it all ... style, quality, power, high-tech, and an identity.  Heads turn.  The seating for the driver's a 10-way seat ... as comfortable as any I've ever had; unfortunately the 2006 model had a 4- way passenger seat but this glaring error has been corrected in the 2007 model (that is otherwise the same car).  The V-6 puts out enough power to accelerate this 4000+ pound vehicle from 0 - 60 in less than 6 seconds.  On the highway it is steady as a rock.  The Sport model is as nimble and fun to drive as any of the five Corvettes I've had and FAR more comfortable.  In 16 months it has only been in for routine oil changes."

This is a very smart car, I'll guarantee that it will move you in a way that you never had experienced before.  You will enjoy every minute of it.  You can have all the luxury, performance and gagets in a car, but the most important thing is safety.  I felt free and secure driving my new born baby around.  I've this for nine month and still enjoy every minute of it.  Don't take my word for it, go test drive for yourself.  Enjoy!"

I had originally planned on getting the FX, but walked past this car on the lot and had to have it!  I purchased a corporate driven vehicle that had not been previously titled.  I got such a deal on this car!  I have owned many cars and this is far and away the best one ever!  If you want a new car you need to at least give this one a test drive first!  This is my first Infiniti, but will not be my last!"

It combines spirited performance from the 3.5 V-6, great handling due to the sport package and incredible interior amenities and comfort.  BMW owners marvel at how spacious is the interior.  Maintenance has been routine and operating expenses fairly low. Only annoyance is the inadequate seat belt clearance with the sport seats requiring alot of effort to buckle up!  Gas mileage could be better at 18.8 miles per gallon mixed hwy/city.  "
infiniti,m35,2006,AEL, 08/25/2009,Great But,3,Car is very good BUT there are some things that are ridiculous. The one that is driving me nuts and is dangerous and cannot be fixed is the Phone/navigation system. Some over paid fool allowed it that when you are on the cars blue tooth phone (incoming volume to low) the Map screen switches to a display telling you on the phone. The Map cannot be shown unless you get off the phone. So if you are using the Navigation system and you get or place a call you have to pull off the road until you've finished your conversation. There so far is no fix - its part of the design.    
infiniti,m35,2006,greg, 09/05/2006,This is a quality car,4,"I am very happy with this product. After 18,000 mi. I have only needed oil changes and the car still rides like the day I drove it home.The voice activated controls and navigation system is both easy and fun to use. I normally change cars every 2 to 3 years but I will seriously consider another M35."
infiniti,m35,2006,4-time Infinitiowner, 06/03/2008,Worst $54k car on the market,2,"The voice navigations system does not work thus you are unable to use the navigation system unless you are parked. The voice system can nopt even recognize basis roads such as ""Piedmont Road"".  The dealer says it just works poorly they could not even get the car to recognize the same words.  The gas mileage on highway is 19 miles per gallon which is the worst in class.  The Sport model rides rough.  With so many cars in this class I would not recommend this vehicle and most certainly do not spend the money on the navigation system."

I went to infiniti to test drive G 35 which initially i wanted to buy. After i finished test driving i was pretty happy with its performance, but i wasn't really happy with interior design, Suddenly my eyes got stuck at the M series which came out liek a day before i went to the dealership. WHen I got inside of that, looked at the interior, i was amazed and i decided immediately that if i buy  a car, that would be infiniti. Then i test drove it, the performance was awesome.. I am a great infiniti fan now. I love my car and I can bet that it can beat BMW, Lexus, Audi, Acura easily by price, performance and design. "
infiniti,m35,2006,Chris, 06/24/2006,Not that great - electrical problems,2,This car has had a lot of electrical system problems.  It's been in and out of the shop numerous times. It doesn't drive that well; brakes grab and it steers hard left.  Interior looks nice but isn't that comfortable on long trips.  Take a pass on this model and buy a BMW or Mercedes.
infiniti,m35,2006,Jeff C, 05/27/2009,A long-term Best Buy: '06 M35,4,"This is by far the best sedan I have ever owned.  It handles well, is fun to drive and is very reliable.  One minor recall item.  Dealer service has been competent if not a bit pricey.  I have thought about trading it in annually and always come back to the same conclusion:  'this is just a great car!'  Look for reasonable miles, 1 owner and dealer serviced. Ask to see the maintenance book or other evidence of a well cared for vehicle."
infiniti,m35,2006,Michael, 12/08/2009,A lot of bang for the buck.,4,"After driving my 2006 M35 Sport for a month I am really happy. The ride is very smooth and much quieter than the reviews make out. The seats are extremely comfortable and the engine has more than enough power for my needs.  For being a 4 year old car, there is only one minor rattle coming from somewhere near the glove box and that is intermittent.  On the downside, the center stack controls do take some getting used to and the gas mileage is not great.  I'm averaging about 21 mpg.  Overall this really is a great car, fun to drive, and with distinctive looks."
infiniti,m35,2006,dochamp2, 04/17/2005,Infiniti M35,4,I test drove the audi a4 and a6 and they can't hold a candle to the infiniti. A crisp ride with all the comfort one could ask.
infiniti,m35,2006,Tom Abrahamson, 04/04/2005,My M,4,"The driving experience of the M35 sport will sell you this car. I test drove BMW530/545, Audi A6, Cadilac CTX, Lincoln LS. After the initial thrill of driving the M35, I have had the car for a month and a half and still love to get behind the wheel. I believe this to be the best car in its class, and the best value in its class. Infiniti seemed to provide more options for your dollar than the other vehicles. If you love gadgets this car has them without sacrifincing the real car underneath."
infiniti,m35,2006,mvp, 10/03/2005,Love my M35!,4,"Purchased this car after finding that the Lexus competition does nothing when you press the pedal. Finally, the Lexus salesman took me to a downhill ramp, asked me to floor it, and Voila! It moved. Big Deal. The M35 has excellent acceleration at city speeds, even uphill. Touch the gas and enjoy serious forward motion.  Has a quiet ride (surprise, one review said it was noisy) and it just glides over streets, including potholes. I'm still marveling at the fab suspension.  Love the tech features and the thoughtfulness in allowing us to do things in more than one way - you're not wedded to using the voice system. Best of all, it talks to my Treo 650, making hands-off phone calls a breeze!"
infiniti,m35,2006,Papa Jack, 09/06/2006,Unless you drive it in the rain!!!!,4,"My oh my, my first AWD and with all those horses...two days of terrible storms and I was da king of da road. Fabulous seat comfort made me want to buckle up and drive to Perdition (or Moosejaw),  I have had 6 Infinitis (last was a G-35 w rwd) but this is the real thing. Gas mileage not as good as promised but if I spend $45k for a car should I be whining? Voice activation system GPS and I have translation problems. Effortless acceleration and auto/manual shift is smoother than my G- 35 was."
infiniti,m35,2006,Ross A, 07/16/2008,Great Ride,4,"My M35 was one of the most fun cars to drive that I have ever owned. Plenty of power and very quite. I never had a single problem with my M35. Just did the normal services and put fuel in it. To me, the best cars are the ones that never have to go to the shop except for servicing."
infiniti,m35,2006,Gremlins, 07/24/2008,Electrical gremlins,4,A wonderful car except I have had 4 experiences with electrical gremlins.  The lights have come on during rain storms & refuse to go off!  Somewhere water is getting to a computer & the dealership cannot fix the problem.  My experience with Infiniti roadside is not to be in a hurry.  A minimum of an hour wait for just simple jump.  Ready to go back to the German cars again!!  
infiniti,m35,2006,srichter, 09/29/2008,Awesome Value for a Luxury Car,4,"I leased the M for 3 yrs and it has been a flat out great car, The positives have been many. Great acceleration, great handling, incredibly fun to drive. I compared it with Acura, Audi and it was more affordable and more fun! Infiniti has been great on service and overall customer service but I have found their prices to be excessive. The only cons I have experienced have been with the bluetooth. The reception on both ends in so poor, it's not worth using."
infiniti,m35,2006,bgregory, 10/30/2008,Hard to find a negative,4,"Great car. When I bought this car I drove all other cars in its class.  Now after 2 years I am very happy with my decision. Still get strangers complimenting the car. I drive it pretty hard and am averaging 18.5 mpg. I prefer to drive her as she was intended, and it is fun to drive. The fit and finish is still perfect after 28,000 miles. The interior design is very comfortable from a drivers perspective. Good trunk space. Holds 4 sets of golf clubs. Mine has 14 speaker sound system. Awesome! Negative? microphone for phone sounded poor. Infiniti has a fix and did it for free. I am told it sounds great. Intelligent cruise control is very nice but does not like the rain. I live in Seattle. "
infiniti,m35,2006,Tomas, 11/11/2008,Awesome M,4,This is a great car. It has style without the snobbery. I love the understated elegance of the car. It has a bit more road noise that some of its peers in this class but overall its an excellent. 
infiniti,m35,2006,Waltersbuy, 11/28/2008,The car you love to hate.,4,"I love all the technology in this car. The interior is roomy and comfortable. The back up camera is so helpful and the push button start is very convenient. Car has a lot of power and gets going really fast! I have had many problems with the glove box rattling. Took it into the dealer and they replaced the glove box but it hangs a little on the left side. Brakes are HORRIBLE on the M35 sport. Had to replace all the brakes at 19,000 miles. If put on any other tires besides the OEM ones, then the car rides like crap, shaking on the freeway and all. "
infiniti,m35,2006,David, 04/01/2009,I own 2 M35X AWD and love them,5,"I have 2 of these and can't imagine why I had a BMW before.  I love the rear camera, voice activated nav and phone, heated and cooled seats.  The service bills are less than half of what I paid on my last BMW once the BMW service plan ended.  The AWD is great in the mountains and light snow. After owning 8 Lexus cars and SUV's I didn't think I would switch, but I like this better than the GS AWD sedan."
infiniti,m35,2006,Will, 06/26/2009,Most car for your buck,4,"I spent months looking for my next luxury sedan, but I fell in love with the M35 as soon as I saw it. Sleek, not flashy exterior complements a roomy, comfy interior loaded with technology. Sound system is awesome (14 bose speakers), and 6 cd player plays data cds too, very useful. Nav sytem, dvd player, push start ignition, heated/cooled seats, the list goes on. The backup cam is the best on the market right now. The 280hp provides plenty of kick, and the AWD and snow mode features truly shine in the snowy New England weather I live with. Overall a very smooth ride, and very fun. Low maintenance, but Infiniti service is somewhat expensive. Absolutely the best car for the amount I spent."
infiniti,m35,2006,Steve C, 07/27/2009,The REAL 4 Door Sports Car,4,"After comparing the E350, 530 and GS 300, the Infiniti soared over all challengers. Reliability, performance, features, etc. Drove the base model first, ended up buying the Sport. This M is a sports car by every definition. Quick, responsive & confident. I took a freeway on ramp cloverleaf @ 50 and the 245/40/19's didn't even chirp. Nissan needs to share its TM'd 4DSC title with its cousin! The road noise and feel are detractors if you expect or desire a smooth and quiet ride, and maybe I will tire of the firmness and noise. All I know is that now I drive it every chance I get, even though I bought it for my wife! More than ample room in the front and rear seats along with the trunk."

infiniti,m35,2006,Mick, 07/29/2009,Incredible car/affordable used,4,"The M35 is the hands down winner that delivers an excellent balance of price, reliability, performance and features.  For some reason, the M35's first two years of depreciation is greater than most other luxury cars making used models very affordable.  Why?  I have no idea; the M35 one of the best sedans on the market.  It is likely you can find this model about 2 years old at less than half of original MSRP.  I purchased mine about a year ago (8/2008) and it is still under full factory warranty (5/60 b2b, 6/70 pwrtrain).  O2 sensor replacement was the only warranty job performed to date.  No other issues.  An all around incredible car."
infiniti,m35,2006,aseetpatel, 07/26/2009,M35 reliability,4,"This car is solid, I just finished 4 years with it and am heading into year 5.  I saw a couple posts regarding a rattle - I had it too and just figured out last year that it was the intermittent wiper speed turn handle.  I also had trouble with the hands free phone and the dealer put in the same mic that the newer ones have and it works ok.  Having gone thru a wide variety of cars (2 acuras, 1 BMW, 1 Lexus, 1 Cadillac, 1 olds Aurora) I have to say this by far has been my best experience."
infiniti,m35,2006,REG, 11/01/2009,Best Luxury Sedan for the Money,4,"I leased my M for 39 months and it was nearly perfect in every way.  Solid performance, ultra comfort, every feature you can think of (and more), and as reliable as they get.  No defects whatsoever, and OK gas mileage (22.5 mpg).  I'm waiting for the next gen M which will be another killer and, supposedly, a hot hybrid as well. "
infiniti,m35,2006,Tim, 09/15/2010,Best Bargain in the Luxury Category,4,"So far, our 2006 M35X has far exceeded our expectations.  The interior especially, is something that needs to be seen and used to be appreciated.  Out of all the gizmos and gadgets controlled by the center console and LCD screen, it is somehow still very easy and convenient to use. The seats are supportive and ""sporty"" while still being a very comfortable place to spend the afternoon. Performance from the 3.5 V6 is more than adequate, although it isn't an adrenaline pumping muscle car, of course.  Best way to describe it is ""deceptively fast"".  It never slams you in the seat, but 80 mph happens quickly and very easily. Overall, there aren't many negatives I can say about the car. "
infiniti,m35,2006,mpbross, 02/03/2008,Great Car,4,"Have driven BMWs for years, wanted something that had great performance (power, speed, agility) as well as style and comfort, for less than a BMW or Mercedes. Was wanting a Q45 but they aren't in production so I got the M35 and I love it. It is great fun to drive, very responsive & aerodynamic. It is very roomy for clients and a husband who is 6'3"". Love the sport package look and feel. I've only had two issues with the car: 1) already have had to have rust spots from paint chips on body fixed (due to rocks thrown up on highway) and to me it seems the BMW body/paint stood up better and 2) needed a new battery because one cell went out."
infiniti,m35,2006,Dan S, 04/07/2005,Love this car,4,"Had the car a week.  So far its great! Power, fun to drive, easy to use nav and other goodies.  Roomy interior, great radio/CD (tech package).  Great lease rates!  So far the best car I've owned (leased) in the last 28 years I've been driving"
infiniti,m35,2006,Westlake Ed, 04/09/2005,1 Great Car,4,"This is my 2nd Infiniti. Very strong performance. Ride is smooth, but more road feel in the sport model. Interior is very comfortable, but not plush. Voice recoginition system is easy to use and great with a bluetooth phone. Rear camera takes a little getting used to, but works very well. Fit and finish is first rate, and 19"" wheels are beautiful in chrome. Dealer discounted MSRP slightly, but that is expected on a new model. Mileage is not good, but a 280HP power plant is expected to use quite a bit of fuel. Really like this car so far."
infiniti,m35,2006,DrTravel, 04/29/2005,Better than a BMW for alot less $$$,4,"The M35 has a very teutonic feel about it but has a better engine, better handling, and much better reliability.  Plus I get to save over $10K - for me that's real money.  The car is not as luxurious (or quiet) as the Lexus GS but then again I prefer to be driving the car rather than having the car drive me. That being said, the car feels more luxurious and is definitley quieter than the M-B E-series and the BMW 5- series.  I chose the non-sport version because it has 90% of the sport version's handling but provides a more comfortable daily ride.  The central control center is growing on me.  Love the ventilated seats and the upgraded stereo is much betetr than average.   "
infiniti,m35,2006,TomC100, 05/02/2005,M35 is Awesome,4,"I owned the Audi A-6 until I purchased the Infiniti awd M35 with the Journey package.  Car has excellent acceleration, tight handling and is pure plesure to drive.  The voice recognition, adaptive headlights and airconditioned seats are my favorite features.  I have the umbri gray color and have gotten more compliments on it than any other vehicle I've owned.  ALl the redundtant knobs and buttons might be a bit much in the interior, but other than that, I have no complaints.  Infiniti is on more of a comeback with this sweet ride.  "
infiniti,m35,2006,Eli, 05/04/2005,Wow what a car.....,4,"I just picked up my new G35X, in pearl ivory with wheat leather...BEAUTIFUL I really wanted the sport model but being from Pennsylvania I needed to think of winter so I opted for the all wheel drive model. So I sported it up with the 18"" chrome rims and the areo package. The car is amazing I cannot say enough great things about it. It's smarter than a person with two PHD's. I compared the ACURA RL, the Lexus GS and the Audi A8. I am sure I made the right decision. The voice activation controls are wild. The car shares the driveway with its big brother my 2004 Infiniti FX. I shopped every Infinit dealership from Brooklyn to Baltimore and wound up buying it at my local dealership. "
infiniti,m35,2006,E.Maple, 05/19/2005,M35-excellent,4,"Awesome ride with the sport package, super quick.  The fit and finish are very nice and the interior is roomy.  I have had BMW's and for the money you cannot get any better than this."
infiniti,m35,2006,steve cooper, 05/27/2005,BMW Killer,4,"The infiniti M35X is everything advertised and more. It performs like a sports car and rides like a high end luxury car,with all the bells and whistles.  It easily blows away my BMW 525! "
infiniti,m35,2006,mmm good, 05/29/2005,Best car I've owned,5,"I can't belive the quality of this car. Every thing is tight and built with HQ materials.  Even the doors sound great.  Best Bose system ever (& i've owned 4. I've never been much of a car audiophile, but this baby just begs to be played with.  Power is sweet.  The VQ engine revs so easily.  Ride is sweet too.  I was expecting harsh bumps with those 18's, but  not so.  bumps and other road imperfections are realy muted."
infiniti,m35,2006,Jerry Ryen, 06/12/2005,The ultimate gadget,4,"From the moment you drive this car off the dealer's lot, you'll dream up reasons to take it out for a drive. The miles tick off effortlessly because you are so relaxed with the quietness of the interior and only the sound of the audio system. This car has the best of the best when it comes to gadgets. I own the very latest camera, PDA, computer, you name it gadget. This car tops them all. And its very intuitive; most anyone will be able to learn each of the features in no time. I told my wife not to get black because black cars show the dust and dirt more. I've changed my mind. I wouldnt have this car in any other color. It's truly a dream."
infiniti,m35,2006,jojot, 06/28/2005,M35 vs TL,4,I traded an Acura TL for the M35 and the quality of the M35 is better BY FAR.  The ride is solid and quiet. This could be my first of many Infinitys if it proves to be as reliable as I think it will.
infiniti,m35,2006,bgwlsw, 07/09/2005,Awesome,4,"It has the latest gadgets, safety features, and the machine moves!  The torque rivals the Acura Legend of the early 90's.  There is nothing so far that is suspect in this beast!  It handles so well.  It was a better buy than the Acura or the Jaguar at that price!"
infiniti,m35,2006,sjm, 07/09/2005,Thrilled to death,5,"I researched and drove MB, BMW 5 series, Lexus, Acura, Volvo and Audi A6-the Infiniti M35 blew me away.  The options I wanted were provided in the journey package without unneeded extras.  The car is a pleasure to drive.  Bluetooth works great- get satellite radio.  This car offers more bang for the buck."
infiniti,m35,2006,mattyb, 07/22/2005,Love this car!!!,4,This car is fantastic.  The only item I am not a big fan of are the controls on the steering wheel. I tend to hit them unintentionally.  
infiniti,m35,2006,FL M35 owner, 07/27/2005,Amazing,4,"Advanced technology, advanced styling, advanced performance.  This car is a ten. Wish you could see the smile on my face!"
infiniti,m35,2006,physicsdawg, 07/27/2005,M35 best car owned,5,"My former favorite was always 280ZX T top.  Great fun and powerful.  However, the M35 blows away everything, including 280ZX.  I tried the BMWs, Accura, etc., M35 is an incredible vehicle.  Infiniti service is the best too.  This was our 5th infiniti!"
infiniti,m35,2006,Joe M, 08/17/2005,The Infiniti M35 is a joy to own,5,"The Infiniti M35 Sport is definitely the best car I've ever owned. This car simply oozes personality and soul, which is something that seems to be missing from many of its competitors, especially those from Japan. The interior accouterments are well designed and appealing, and the technology is top notch. Photographs do not do this car justice, as the smooth and subtle lines are very hard to detect from a simple picture."
infiniti,m35,2006,Marc, 08/28/2005,One of a select few,4,"In my lifetime, I have been truly captivated by a handful of cars.  The Infiniti M is one of those cars.  I have owned cars such as the 240-Z, MR- 2, and Stealth/3000GT.  They were all really great cars, but the M does exactly what it has been promoted to do with incredible precision.  I believe that the engineers were remarkably focused in their efforts.  There just isn't anything to complain about; I've never driven a car quite like this before.  The engine, handling, and interior comforts are in a class by themselves.  If you are interested in a sporting car with four doors and refinement, this is it.  The Acura and Lexus don't come close."
infiniti,m35,2006,JJ, 09/11/2005,Built to drive,4,"Infiniti's M has had a major facelift for 2006. The reviews from Consumer reports, Motor Trend, Road & Track, and other magazines have been outstanding. Great styling, workmanship, and materials. The 3.5L motor is the same as in the G35 and 350Z with great reliability and performance.  Suspension is tight with minimal body lean going into corners aggressively. 19 in rims with summer tires makes this car stick to the road.  GPS Navigation system is full of features with voice activated navigation that allows one to search not only by address, but phone numbers as well. Linking to bluetooth phone and hands free talking is available too."
infiniti,m35,2006,marron612, 09/22/2005,Love my M35X,4,"I had an A6 Audi for 5 years; good car but hard on brakes and a little small interior. The infiniti is plush, yet sporty with lots of room for me and my grandchildren.  I love speaking to the computer for radio and climate control and not having to take my hands off the wheel.  Has great pick up hands well and I like seeing what is behind me ."
infiniti,m35,2006,zidecar, 09/23/2005,The 1st Month,4,"The new M series is a satisfying integration of style, performance and useability with technology as the glue. It foreshadows many of the new features that should become common place in the family 4 door sedan over the next 5-10 years. What makes the M different from its competitors in this class? It is the flexibility of ""choice""! The driver has the option to exercise either a traditional or a ""high tech"" approach to using the car's many features. It remains for Infiniti to cultivate a recognizeable public persona for the M to assure its long term success."
infiniti,m35,2006,Giant, 09/26/2005,WOW the best luxury sedan on the market!,4,"Spent about a month shopping for a car, lease was up in about 35 days so I made it an effort to really shop extensively. I was attracted to infiniti's G35 and FX lines, but once I set my eye's on the M, my mouth started to water and I knew something was very special about this car. My first impression was that the interior was unlike any other sedan I had seen, and of course the ample buttons, yes the control panel was the frosting on the cake and the inteligent key made the choice of much easier. I ended up buying the M35 with the journey and tech package. Everyday I drive it I feel as if the car is a rare species, one that gets many looks and turns from pedestrians with Benz's, and BMW's."
infiniti,m35,2006,blov8r, 09/27/2005,Almost perfect,4,"My M35 Sport came fully loaded ... all the gadgets.  It's designed for someone who ""drives"" cars, doesn't merely ""ride"" in them.  Gas mileage is mediocre but in a $50K car that shouldn't be an issue.  The only real negative is the poor power seat adjustment on the passenger's side and I'll bet it will be corrected mid-year or in the next model year.  Bluetooth connectivity is a bit shaky ... phonebooks don't transfer in ... but aside from that it works well.  I actually prefer the body style of the discontinued M45 (more sleek) but overall I consider this car the best I've ever owned.  More fun to drive than any of my Corvettes!"
infiniti,m35,2006,tennnnn, 10/22/2005,best of 4,4,"This is my 4th infinit. I30, I35, FX35, and now the M35x.  GREAT car.  Super driving.  It's a driver's car and yet has comfort for passengers. very quiet for midsized sedan."
infiniti,m35,2006,lawdawgmi, 10/22/2005,Almost perfect....,4,"I have an M35x and absolutely love it.  That said, there is room for a couple of improvements.  I only have two significant issues with this car--the first is road/tire noise.  At highway cruising speeds, especially on concrete-type road surfaces, the road and tire noise is too obtrusive for a high-end midsize luxury vehicle like this one.  I don't demand Lexus-like silence (in fact I've never owned a Lexus and have little basis for comparison), but the M should be at least as soundproof as my BMW X5, and, unfortunately, it's not even close.   My second issue is that the Bluetooth hands free function needs improvement. Not loud enough non my end and not clear enough to people I call."
infiniti,m35,2006,Katherine Vierkorn, 10/26/2005,A Luxurious and Sporty Winner,4,"If you are looking for a luxurious vehicle with spunk, buy the M35.  Even though it is loaded and handles beautifully, it is priced lower than the competition.  It is a blast to drive - check out the acceleration on this V6 (feels like a V8), the turning radius (even good on the AWD model), the responsiveness of the brakes and steering at high speeds.  Wow.  It really stands out in the crowd. It's not just another [insert name of common luxury car in your area here].  It is also surprisingly roomy - front and back.  It sits a little higher off the road than most sedans for easy exit/entry and a better view of the road.  The voice activated control system makes life easy. "
infiniti,m35,2006,Larry, 10/30/2005,Week One,4,"I've had my M35x a week.  What a car!  I had a Lexus GS300 for 7 years.  What a difference between these two cars.  I've got to think the Infiniti is more akin to a BMW for ride and handling.  Comparing the Lexus with the Infiniti, I'd have to say the Lexus had a smoother ride, less responsive handling, a quieter engine, and a smoother transmission shift.  But the Infiniti has power, handling and features and price that beat the 2006 Lexus line hands down.  I love the XM satellite radio.  Now I can start the day in whatever radio mood I'm in - bluegrass, jazz, blues, gospel or comedy.  Love the horsepower in this baby. "
infiniti,m35,2006,Bob Marshburn, 11/18/2005,The new luxury sports sedan leader,5,"The M series from Infiniti is the new luxury sports sedan leader.  After comparing the BMW 5 series, Lexus GS, Audi A6, and Acura RL there was no comparison.  The M leads them all in value, styling, handling, quiet, comfort, and performance.  I could not be happier with my purchase!"
infiniti,m35,2006,drockhold, 11/21/2005,Everybody needs to drive an m35x,5,"I've had this vehicle for about 6 months and wow! Do I ever love this car--it is real fast and the cornering and handling ability is outstanding! It gets great looks everywhere I go and the performance overall is is that of a bonifide new millenium ""muscle car""  Granted, it isn't a porsche or a 10 cylinder Mercedes. However, it beat-- hands down any other car like it in its class and I researched and drove them all--the CTS, Audi,Acura RL,BMW, LS, and Lexus.  I was really wanting a Lexus but the 2 Lexus dealerships I visited really turned me off as did the actual vehicle because of no all-wheel drive at the time of sale.  It's great watching other people look at it too!"
infiniti,m35,2006,kevin, 12/14/2005,best ever,5,"this car was reviewed in March by a USA Today automobile writer.  He concluded his review by stating that the mew 2006 m35/45 would make bmw, lexus, mercedes obsolete.  I thought he was overstated until I bought the car.  It is a dream and dollar for dollar the best car on the road.  It is a smooth handler with a great tranmission, wonderful interior, and delivers its 280 horsepower with style and performance.  think it is the best new car in years.  I have never received more compliments on a car from people that know nothing about infiniti, which rarely advertises any car."
infiniti,m35,2006,troubled m35 owner, 12/31/2005,So Very Disappointed!,1,"I have owned this m35 for 7 months and it has been the most frustrating time I have ever owned a car.  You would think after spending $50,000 + for a car< I would have an enjoyble experience.  NOt the case.  The blue tooth sound quality is muffled and can't use the feature.  The cart rattles like crazy.  The dealer can't find half of them.  The seat broke.  There is a brake and suspension problem that the dealer cannot figure out.  When I call Infiniti Customer service, they basically tell me ""too bad"".  Take the car back to the dealer.  Customer service  is  horrible.  They give you the run around and just keep avoiding the problem.  I finally got so disgusted, I sold the car. "
infiniti,m35,2006,V, 01/01/2006,Lots of car for the money,4,"The M35X is my choice for an AWD daily driver. Compared to the Germans - BMW 530xi, MB E350 4MATIC and Audi A6 - the Infiniti is better equipped, more comfortable, more reliable (according to Consumer Reports) and similar in overall performance. The Lexus didn't impress me, and I found the Acura RL a bit sluggish and ""loose"". Plus, at least in my area, the M35X was about 20% less expensive than any of these cars on a 3 year lease.    "
infiniti,m35,2006,Marlin, 01/02/2006,Great Vaule,4,"We have about 8,000 miles on our M so far and we love it.  The sport package offers a perfect balance between performance and luxury.  This is a ""must have"" sedan in this price range."
infiniti,m35,2006,Serious driver, 01/02/2006,This is a driver's car,4,"Got Journey/Tech, black/black, sweet. Lots of fun to drive. Taut suspension, excellent motor/exhaust sound. Noisy? Well, I don't want a banana boat like a Lexus and I know those are quiet and also mush-like in their ride. Go get a Lexus if you want the old GM feel (which does have its place). But I like to drive and this little sweetheart accelerates well, sits snug on the road and stays flat on hard curves. Turn off the annoying lane change feature, otherwise sweet. But I'm new with the car, only 200 miles, will report back later. "
infiniti,m35,2006,brian haug, 01/06/2006,My Dream Car,4,"I have wanted to buy an infiniti for about 3 years now. I liked the G35 but when I saw the M35 I jumped right in. The technology, comfort, and look of this car is unmatched to me in this price range. I didn't need the 8 cylinder so the M35 was perfect. The drive just feels right. This all coming from a former BMW owner."
infiniti,m35,2006,RichardZ, 01/07/2006,Love to drive,4,I traded my 2004 Acura TL for the M35 and now LOVE to drive again.  This is an awesome car.  It is beautiful and rides like a dream.
infiniti,m35,2006,bcorig, 01/07/2006,They did it right,4,"Solid, smooth ride. More than enough power. Tempts you to do things one probably shouldn't do. Handling excellent. Bigger than RL, G Lex inside and out. Instruments well placed. Sound system adequate. FUN to get in every day. "
infiniti,m35,2006,Jason in Taipei, 01/10/2006,Very Solid Car,4,"Was not looking to buy an Infiniti, but was really attracted to once I saw the M35. The performance and features are just plain solid. The suspension is not overly stiff like the BMWs."
infiniti,m35,2006,RDZumbaugh, 01/11/2006,The BEST Drive,4,"I LOVE this car.  Without a doubt, it is a HOT car.  With the 14 speaker Bose Stereo, it makes driving pure pleasure.  The POWER is incredible and at a GREAT price.  You certainly get a lot of value - great price with tons of amenities."
infiniti,m35,2006,New M35 Rocks, 01/21/2006,Better than a LexusGS300 by far,4,"I had a Lexus RX300  for a few years and hated the feel and workmanship. I finally was able to buy a M35 and wow have i been pleased! No unexpected shop visits and great service. I am always getting looks from others. A Mercdes Benz service mechanic pulled me over one day to say that I had a very nice car. I love the Journey package too and it is worth the extra cost. Heated and cool seats are great. Wood interior is nice. I didn't like the shiny wood interior of Lexus. Also, like the feel of a Rear Wheel Drive car better. I test drove the GS300 and I had to literally slam my foot on the pedal to get a quick accleration. Guess that is the price to pay for a quieter engine. "
infiniti,m35,2006,Leo Morgenstern, 02/02/2006,Driving in style,4,"The new Infniti M35X has it all! It's fun to drive and has all extra's. I have never been in a car with all the options the M35X has. With the t.v. and entertainment console in the back seat I never hear from the kids anymore.I love the car, it has plenty of power and is easy to drive and enjoy.  THANKS, LEO M."
infiniti,m35,2006,Mulligan, 02/04/2006,Love it,4,I have had the car 2 weeks and love it. It's very comfortable to ride in and appreciate all the personal adjustments I can make. Love the way the Navigation System works. Today I had the dealer setup my new Bluetooth phone and it works great. I had a Mercedes C320 and this car is a big improvement on comfort and ride and features.
infiniti,m35,2006,mhardy, 02/04/2006,I Looooove this car!,4,"Being a household that had two SUVs, we decided we really missed not having a sedan.  I really liked my friend's TL and set out to look at them.  At the Acura dealership, the TLs were great, but they were offering a good deal on the RL.  I liked the RL alot, but being a prior Infiniti owner, I wanted to look at the G.  Needless to say, when I got to the Infiniti dealership and saw the M sitting there, it was game over for Acura.  Everything about this car was perfect:  the interior, the lines, the smooth engine.  I went back and forth between the RL and M about 3-4 times to be sure, but while the RL was a nice car, it did not grab me the way the M has.  I looooove this car!"
infiniti,m35,2006,Marvin Frank, 02/06/2006,Fun to drive,4,"After driving Lexus exclusively for past 10 years, including LS & SC, this car is a pleasant and exciting change. It's fun to drive and really solid. I find the seat a bit too firm and the dash dials overkill and somewhat distracting.  Passenger seat sits too low and needs elevation control. Compared car to new Lexus GS 330 and car has limited colors, much slower performance and limited visibility compared to M35.  Dealer very liberal in pricing even with limited stock.  I was looking for silver with brown interior but chose white/wheat since lighter interior really attractive."
infiniti,m35,2006,cool car, 03/26/2006,WOW,5,"This car is so amazing it has everything anyone could ask for and with a reasonable price. the car's rear wheel steering is great and the backup camera is so cool it makes parking so easy. i totally recommed this car to anyone you can afford it. infiniti really knows how to make a car, but i might be biased because i did have two infinitis like 5 years ago. "
infiniti,m35,2006,MikeB, 03/29/2006,Still a thrill to drive 1 year later..,4,"I purchased my M35x with the premium option pkg about 1 year ago (my kids adore the DVD player nad this car's sound sytem is truly amazing). It still feels new everytime I get into it. This is car I don't think you'll ever tire of. Wonderful pleasent interior, intuitve controls and a beautiful road feel. Great engine growl and fun to play with in manuel shift mode! I can only imagine what this car'll be like in 2 years if it is this good in its' first incarnation. I wouldn't wait to get one, I've loved this last year of driving it."
infiniti,m35,2006,C. Hearn, 04/12/2006,Still Waiting,4,"This is my third, and best , Infiniti. (I35 and FX35)and I have yet to use the warranty on any Infiniti i have owned. This car runs great on regular no lead fuel and gets 25-26 Hwy. and nearly 20 in town. Excellent technology and teriffic comfort. There is no better value than Infiniti when the term is defined as reliability, comfort, features and quality. My dealer is great too."
infiniti,m35,2006,badboy, 05/05/2006,Great Var,4,"Only ""problems""  1. Does not lock doors when you shift into drive or reverse and does not unlock doors when you shift into park.  2. Does not come with rear adudible sensor for backing up. Car has the camera but not the audio option which is helpful.  3. Dealer was not forthright with its promises and statements. I had to verify with Infiniti and correct the dealer.  Otherwise a great car at a price under the competition."
infiniti,m35,2006,drolla, 05/06/2006,M35 + Tech & Journey = SWEET!,4,"This is such a sweet car, it's hard not to love it. There is plenty of power, plenty of comfort, plenty of style. I've never been the type to walk around the car with a cloth to wipe off dirt smudges (the opposite, in fact), but this car has made me change; I find it to be a thing of beauty. It has so many features and conveniences that it would almost be a toy if it weren't such an incredibly driving machine."
infiniti,m35,2006,orlandom35, 05/10/2006,Whip,4,"I drove them all (5 series, GS, A6) and this one is far and away the sweetest. Total luxury and performance with a technology package that is unmatched. Fuel economy is only an issue when you hammer the accelerator (which is hard not to do!) This thing turns heads with smooth lines and mean looking rims. I only leased it for 2 years because I tend to get tired of cars at that point in the ""relationship"" but I may buy it at the end of the term!"
infiniti,m35,2006,Robert, 05/22/2006,Great Car,5,"This is a great car, its loaded and the ride is super. This is my second infiniti my first was a 04 G35 sedan. "
infiniti,m35,2006,Rick W, 05/21/2006,Great car- but I miss my A6,4,"This is a great car - no question about it.  It does almost everything very well.  But - if it got stolen tomorrow, I would replace it with an Audi A6.  I drove 2 A6's before my 06 M35 and I miss the ""feel"" of the A6 handling.  The M rides like a Lexus - if you like that very smooth, but somewhat ""floating"" ride, you are gonna love the M.  If you like the German ""road feel"" - you may miss it in the M.  As a quick aside, my wife just bought a G35 AWD and I actually prefer the handling of the G better than that of the M.  Much more road feel.  The M 35 is a FAST car.  Unless you have Nascar roots, this 6 cylinder car is certainly sufficient to speed you around town.  M45 is overkill."
infiniti,m35,2006,John Milton, 05/24/2006,Hold On Tight,4,"We are very pleased with our acquisition of a M35.  The car is well-made and reliable.  The dealer treated us with respect.  Followup has been good.  The car has a very European feel to it.  As a result I sometimes accelerate in a ""herky-jerky"" manner.  I am hoping to improve my driving skills as I continue to drive it more."
infiniti,m35,2006,Gary Foster, 06/03/2006,M35X chases BMW 535xi,4,"This cr is loaded with electronics, great transmission, very comfortable interior, and a new look exterior that stands out.  It can really jump out of the starting position and the rev on the RPM makes it fun for a open road.  Not the best  for city driving.  On highway, it is smooth and confident, a bit noisy without awesome stereo blasting.  Included XM and DVD audio which both deliver superior digital sound.  Hook up for Ipod as well.  The console feels a bit bulky at first.  It took a bit to get used to.  AWD is good, although it is not an AUDI Quattro.  I think the 18"" tires may have something to do with the awd compared to an A6 with 16"".  Reliable, fast, and fun.  Very hi- tech. "

A few annoying minor things could have been done better.....the seat memory buttons are too low on the door to be useful.  The passenger seat adjustments are too limited... your passenger sits low.  The electric window switches are too far foward on the door....Gas mileage is terrible 17 mpg tops combined driving...The nav system does not invoke the most direct trip. A-B on the garden State might be most direct...but it will send you into 200 adjacent roads for the same trip.  Use nav only when your 3 miles from your destination or it will take you to China. Now the good..Great brakes, great ride, luxurious interior like a living room, sound system"

The M35 is 10 times more fun to drive than my previous car. I also got the tech and journey packages which may driving almost brainless with a great audio system.
infiniti,m35,2006,Stan, 06/22/2006,Great Car,4,"Best car i have ever owned. Came down to Lexus or Infiniti, I chose Infiniti and have never regretted it. Plenty of power you do not need the v8, going around curves is like riding on rails. MY gas mileage is good for a car like this, 17 in town 24 on the road, Love the nav and back up camera. Plenty of tech for anyone. Only down side are headligts due not go out far enough but you get used to it."

Love the Bose 5.1 sound system.  Nav and voice recognition systems are great. The wife loves the XM sat.  Looked at Mercedes, Audi, Lexus and others before buying.  Dollar for dollar the M35 is the best value.  The whole experience compares very well with our G35 Coupe!!  Love them both."

They cannot give me an answer as to why it happened.  It has now happened twice without any explanation as to why it happened.  Infiniti did bring a loaner car directly to my home for the weekend which was very nice but I am very concerned that they can not pinpoint the exact problem. I have owned Infinities in the past (G35) and never had any problems. "
infiniti,m35,2006,charlie, 07/22/2006,I Love it,4,"I bought the 2006 M35x when it was introduced in Mar 05.  I looked at all other cars, but purchased this car.  I have owned lexus for years, but was not impressed with the new GS.  I have to say, I love everything about this car.  The ride, style performance, features are all great. It is over a year I have owned this car and have not had any problems.  By far, this is the best car i have ever owned."
infiniti,m35,2006,md, 07/23/2006,wonderful car,4,"Have had the car for 6 months and didn't think I would love it this much. I now look forward to my commute. Impressed with handling, speed and braking. The car is both luxurious and sporty. Love all the gadgets. Looked at the usual German and Japanese models and it boiled down to the Lexus GS and the M35x. German cars just aren't that comfortable. Didn't expect this car to be so much better than my old GS. I now find the nav system, back-up camera, hands-free phone and satellite radio indispensable. My only dislike is the light-colored interior shows every smudge (wash hands and feet before getting in)."
infiniti,m35,2006,Bruce, 07/27/2006,Great Car,5,"This is a almost a perfect ten. With this kind of performance/ horsepower and handling you're getting about as good mileage as one can expect. I am averaging around 18.5 for city driving. Not bad at all! The only negative experience that I have had with the dealership service response. The car was delivered missing a very small part. The salesman acknowledged the problem, and promised he would send me the(less than $5) part. Well, 3 calls to the saleman, 4 calls to the salesmanager, 3 calls to the general manager, and 3 calls to Infiniti customer service PLUS 4 months waiting and I finally received the small item. Car is a ten, service is a one! Outstanding car. Highly recommend"
infiniti,m35,2006,Gigi, 07/27/2006,Great Car,4,"I have to drive long distances, and this car really makes it such a pleasure.  It is fun to drive."
infiniti,m35,2006,SMOOTH, 08/05/2006,Smooth M,4,"It's been tagged, CONSUMER REPORT CAR of the YEAR and it lives up to the tag, plus! A whole lot of BANG for the buck.  Infiniti has champion in the M!!!!"
infiniti,m35,2006,KEN, 08/19/2006,Great Car,4,"Had 4 Audi's and this car made me switch.  Great combination of styling, performance, handling and features.  Really enjoy getting in and driving this car. And all at a price well below Audi. Sorry Audi, maybe someday you will win me back."
infiniti,m35,2006,ken, 08/22/2006,pleasantly surprised,4,"shopped volvo, lexus, bmw, mercedes, really was impressed with infiniti's attention to detail and the features.  The dash put me over the edge, real rosewood with beige interior was simply beautiful.  Runs extremely smooth and is very refined.  The features that add to the package include a/c seats, intelligent cruise control, intuitive nav. system, and a bunch of safety oriented stuff.  The back up camera   Average 21 mpg combo city/highway.  It is difficult not to jump on it, very willing to get up to highway speed.  It is also difficult to fully appreciate all the pluses of the vehicle.  Very happy I bought this over the 530i or the lexus.  From a bang for the buck standpoint, big score."
infiniti,m35,2006,Steve, 03/09/2005,M35,4,"A solid, quiet, and heavy sports car in a sedan shell, with excellent handling, but a firm ride.  The precision steering and superb handling makes it particularly fun to drive. The six is deceptively powerful and performs like an eight; in fact, more powerful than many eights.  Gear shifts are imperceptible.  The air conditioning is adequate, but seems underpowered, and not on par with the 2006 Lexus GS 300.  Bought the base model M35; options are expensive and just a few will add up fast.  Drove the new Lexus ES 300 before deciding on the M35.  The Lexus has a somewhat more luxurious interior and softer ride, but the handling characteristics are far inferior to the M35."
infiniti,m35,2006,EV, 03/10/2005,Awesone,4,"After test driving the BMW 5 series and the Lexus GS300, this car won hands down.  The ride features, although some what high tech, are outstanding.  I have only had the vehicle for 5 days and could not be more plesed.  Best decision I have made for some time"
infiniti,m35,2006,sjpeters, 03/15/2005,Hard to beat!,4,"I drove a lot of cars before I ended up on this one. I owned a Cadillac CTS, I drove a Mercedes E500, Acura RL, TL, Cadillac STS, and looked at the Lexus and BMW. The M35 blew me away. Not only can it handle it's own from a pure driving experience, but economically it can't be touched. You owe it to yourself to drive one if your in the market. "
infiniti,m35,2006,speters57, 03/22/2005,You'll want this car,4,"I've owned many cars in my life, but this one stands out from the rest. It has everything you could ever want, and more. The price is reasonable as well, compared to some other cars in its class, and the standard features are awesome.  If you're looking for a car in the Acura RL, BMW 5 series, Cadillac STS, Lexus GS, you owe it to yourself to drive this car too. If you're like me, you'll be impressed and maybe even buy one. "
infiniti,m35,2006,M35x is GREAT, 03/21/2005,The Best!,5,"This is great!!.  Infiniti really made themselves #1.  This car is absolutely amazing!!  For such a big engine and AWD, the gas milage is still great. I get 19 miles to the gallon city and 25 hwy.  People always turn their heads when I drive by.  I have gotten such good feedback on my M35x.  The interior is very confortable,and luxurious!  My kids have so much room in the back, and they love the DVD player.  The car fits me and my family so well we never want to give it up!"
infiniti,m35,2006,Scott E, 04/27/2005,YIKES!,5,"My Acura RL was coming off lease and I looked at everything....BMW 530, Audi A6, MB E class and the Acura RL.  The RL was $200 more a month than my '02 lease.  I couldn't warrant $760 for an ACURA!! I drove the others and then the M35...WHAT A CAR!!  The amenities are 2nd to none, from the rear camera, voice recognition that my kids can use and have fun with, the turning headlights, super stereo, keyless start, etc.  The ride and performance are incredible.  I got the Journey Pkg, XM and trunk mat.  Interior room is amazing (larger than the Q45). For the money and then some, I couldn't find a car that came close to competing based on looks, handling, size, comfort or amenities. I'm thrilled "
infiniti,m35,2006,Alan, 04/26/2005,The best of its class,4,"The M35x is a pleasure to drive, and based on the number of random people who have complimented me on the car, I'd say it looks great too.  It's nimble and fast, quiet and refined, and has every imaginable gadget.  It feels solid but not heavy, sporty but not harsh.  I really think Infiniti has outdone itself with this model.  The build quality is better than the BMW 530 and the roominess and looks beat the Acura RL hands down.  As a trusted friend said, ""It says success without being arrogant about it""."
infiniti,m35,2006,Dickster 1, 04/25/2005,Infinit M35 Sport,4,"Great acceleration and handling are just the beginning of the accolades for this finely built and sylish sedan. Equipped with all the bells and whistles including navigation, lane change warning and back up camera assist, it offers safety and spirited fun. The interior is tasteful elegance and the bolstered heated and cooled seats make you feel like they were designed just for you. The keyless system is a feature that I could do without. Keys are still needed to lock the car, so the additional complexity is perhaps overkill. The only negative I've experienced is the low slung design make tires and wheels susceptible to curb scrapes.  Watch out German competitors- you've been out done."
infiniti,m35,2006,Josh, 05/22/2005,"Wow, What a car!",4,"I have never had this much fun driving a car.  I look forward to driving it every day...and that is still the case after alot of driving for 1.5 months!!  Smooth, with lots of power.  Love the Nav, DVD on the Nav screen...what a picture!  Beautiful inside..lots of head room. Great stereo...I plug my ipod into the system...great sound.  Adaptive cruise and Lane departure also very helpfull.  Great brakes!"
infiniti,m35,2006,CSR, 05/25/2005,FANTASTIC!,4,"I purchased my M35 Sport with Tech and Journey packages a month ago,and this car continues to impress me the more I drive it!!I traded in a 2002 BMW 530 I, and had thought that NOTHNING drives like a BMW. I've found out how wrong I was!! While the steering on the M is not the  dead on feeling as the BMW, comfort, ride, and the overall style and the VALUE of the M surpasses the new 5! "
infiniti,m35,2006,Silver Shadow, 06/16/2005,Dream Machine,4,"After looking at the BMW 530, Audi A6, and Lexus GS300, this is the one to own.  Great value, looks, performance, and build.  This is a true ""Drivers"" lux sport car."
infiniti,m35,2006,Ron, 06/17/2005,It's a Kick,5,"Traded a 1995 J30 for an M35 and have not looked back.  Had the J 10 years and loved it, the M is a modern, larger and more advanced version of the J.  It handles well, accelerates quickly, is comfortable and draws looks from others.  We saw it first at the auto show last winter and fell in love with it.  This is our 6th Datsun/Nissan product (first was a 73 240Z)and believe it to be as solid and reliable as the earlier cars, at least as much as one can determine after 6 weeks and 500 miles.  Infiniti, you done good with this one."
infiniti,m35,2006,busy mom, 06/21/2005,for anti-minivan moms - PERFECT!,4,"I'm on the road a lot and a mom of 2 - I wanted comfort, reliability, and safety - but something fun to drive!  I'm in sales and drive about 22Kmi/yr!  This car is PERFECT!  DVD for the kids, Safety features are excellent and all STANDARD!  Lexus wanted $$$ for the same safety!  It's comfortable, stylish, fun to drive yet easy for my kids to get in and out and safe.  Every feature is in the right place - accessible!"
infiniti,m35,2006,bob, 07/03/2005,lots of fun,5,"Test drove the lexus, acura and of course the m35x.  hands down no comparison.  Can't wait to get behind the steering wheel everyday. Lots of  toys. Cars has incredible pickup.  my kids say it ""ROCKS"". navigation system is excellent.  seats very comfortable and stereo system is excellent"
infiniti,m35,2006,louie croce, 07/07/2005,Best midsize car for 2006,5,From the build quality to the way it drives this car is almost perfect. The style stands out and the 19 inch rims the sport package comes with are some of the nicest stock rims ive ever seen. The car has plenty of power for a 6 cyl luxury car and handles great. The interior is comfortable and well laid out and designed. This is well worth the money.
infiniti,m35,2006,Dick, 07/16/2005,M35 Sport,5,"My 2nd Infiniti this year. A great car, great dealership.  I replaced a '03 Jaguar S-Type V8 an I couldn't be happier.  A much better overall automobile. For a car in the same price class as the S-Type...there is no comparison!"
infiniti,m35,2006,michael v, 07/30/2005,"A BMW for $15,000 less!",4,"Replaced my terrific '98 BMW 540i with the M35. Almost identical performance, features, comfort but with likely higher reliability.  V6 engine is very strong and the manumatic shift mode is very responsive.  Steering feel and handling is terrific.  The car corners like its on rails!  Back seat room is enormous!  Front seats are very comfortable, especially with the cooled seat option.  The information system is intuitive unlike I-Drive of new BMWs and the LCD display is easy to read in any lighting.  The fit and finish is first rate.  Huge trunk. Every safety feature you can imagine --  head curtain airbags, ABS, stability control, etc.  You don't need the M45 unless you're a drag racer."
infiniti,m35,2006,edspider1, 08/02/2005,M35x,4,"I still can't believe a swapped my 2004 Lexus LS Ultra for the Infinity M, but I don't regret it for a minute.  The M is fun car to drive.  The drive seat feels so good.  Except for lane departure and the rear DVD, the Lexus had all the same cool features.  But in the Lexus most of them just didn't work.  Infinity really got it right.  Bluetooth, XM, voice recognition, cooling seats all work wonderfully.  Yes, the LS is a tad more refined and polished, but the M is younger, smarter and more fun."
infiniti,m35,2006,Clarksville, 08/05/2005,BMW to Infiniti,4,This is a quality automobile that gives you a great driving experience.  I went from a BMW 540i to the Infiniti and don't regret the change.  The push button ignition is a great feature that has me spoiled with my other car. It rides quietly and has sports car type acceleration.
infiniti,m35,2006,MikeP, 08/08/2005,My New M,4,"After my first 1000 miles I can summarize this car in one word: ""wow"". I just completed a trip through the mountains of West Virginia and it handled the moutain turns and passes with incredible ease. The expression ""corners on rails"" certainly applies. The engine is smooth and powerful with great low end torque. The seats are very supportive, the interior fit and finish is impeccable. The rear backup camera has proven to be a useful feature that I never knew I needed before. Several comparison reports I read consistenly rated the M first among its peers including BMW, Mercedes, Lexus and Acura. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a car in the $50K range."
infiniti,m35,2006,Doug, 08/10/2005,Get One...It is really amazing,4,"Originally, i wanted the Audi A6 3.2.  My cousin got one, it is beautiful and offers a supple ride and is very attractive, but I feel that Infiniti knew what the new A6 was going to be and beat it in every category..first being $$.  You cannot get a better deal in the mid-lux category.  Make sure you opt for the chrome wheels, it just adds so much to the exterior.  The interior is spectacular.  I suggest everyone touch the neck bolster and feel how much cushion supports your head...think and then say...everything else is probably this good...actually, it is!"
infiniti,m35,2006,clark, 08/19/2005,I love this car,4,I love this car.  It is a great combination of performance and luxury.  It is fun to drive and just plain nice to be in.  I test drove every competitor - I personally think it is easily the best car out there - before factoring in that it costs less than all of its serious competition.
infiniti,m35,2006,Love My M, 08/21/2005,Designed to Outperform...,4,"I got rid of my Jag.  What a dog!  I bought the M just as a replacement car.  I was not really in love with it.  But this car simply outperforms and exceeds my expectations at every level.  It is so smart that the AC fan quiets down when I push the Voice Command button.  Then it revs up again after I've given the command! My infatuation with the Jag began to plummet as soon as I brought it home.  In contrast, I love my M more each day!  I love driving this car.  I sometimes take a drive just to drive it....  "
infiniti,m35,2006,James R. Briggs, 08/21/2005,A Really Great Car,4,"I have never owned a car like this. I've driven it 7000 miles so far with absolutely no problems. It is a joy to drive, handles wonderfully and the 14 speaker Bose sound system is the best I've ever heard in a car. In fact, the sound when watching a movie is better than in a theater. I'm still learning all the navigation and information systems. Tremendous is all I can say."
infiniti,m35,2006,Smitty, 08/23/2005,Wolf in Wolf's Clothing,4,"Went to dealer to test drive AWD G.  While waiting for salesperson I opened the door to the M on the showroom floor. The interior looked like it belonged in a yacht.  Hooked right there. Drove the M.  The smile is still plastered to my face.  Smooth, elegant, classy, sporty, fun, nimble.  After one month of ownership I still have that ""Christmas morning"" feeling every time I wake up.  I've owned probably 20 cars over the years and this one blends the joy of my first car, a '70 Chevy Impala, with the fun of my Datsun 240Z.  Before buying,I read everything on the web and drove a half dozen cars allegedly in this category.  You should do the same.  You will have no second thoughts."
infiniti,m35,2006,phillyb, 09/06/2005,Almost Pefect Car,5,"This is the most perfect car I have driven. It is a balance of luxury and performance that no car I have owned can match.  Beautiful interior and exterior and the features were not just a after thought, they are there to be used and are easy to learn to use.  The AWD is just a nice feature, cannot tell it is working, plus it does not affect the handling, like my BMW fixed AWD system did and my Volvo S80 really did, that car rode like a truck compared to my new M35X.

infiniti,m35,2006,rfm13413, 09/08/2005,A Must Automobile to Consider,5,"After researching Audi Acura BMW Mercedes and Lexus. This vehicle offers more amenities, styling and performance than all of the above.  I have owned 2 Audi A6's and was very pleased with both vehicles but after driving the M35 I was hooked. Infiniti has done their homework with this vehicle and has made a fine product."
infiniti,m35,2006,jodyjay, 09/15/2005,"Love the M35, Even With Glitiches",4,"Everything about the M35 is great, but there have been two glitches.  First, on cars with XM satellite radio, when the artist and song titles are displayed, only the first ten characters are displayed, so you don't get the full name of the artist or song title if they exceed 10 characters.  This does not occurr on M35's equipped with Sirius satellite radio.Hopefully, Infiniti is trying to come up with a fix.  Second, my front right tire was leaking air.  On the second return to the dealer, they gave me a knew tire and rim, so hopefully the problem is fixed."
infiniti,m35,2006,joe murray, 09/17/2005,the M35x,4,the car is beautiful and fun to drive.i would like a little more power than the 6 gives you but it is enough.i have not driven it in wintery conditions yet so i can't speak about the all wheel drive
infiniti,m35,2006,W. Shmerler, 09/29/2005,Head Lights,4,Head Lights throw a minimum distance. Difficult to see road especially in bad weather. Standard Headlights throw much further. I am waiting for my dealer to check alignment.
infiniti,m35,2006,JWM5, 10/04/2005,Great Automobile,4,"This is an awesome car. My 2004TL was a fine vehicle but this car is tops. It has outstanding performance, drop dead looks, lots of leg room and quality workmanship throughout. I've only had it for two weeks now but I am truly enjoying my drives each time I have to go somewhere. I can't imagine anything any better for the price. Infiniti really has a winner with this one.   "
infiniti,m35,2006,MSportFiend, 10/07/2005,M is a Magnificent Machine!,4,"Have owned a new M35 Sport for 3 weeks now and fall in love with it more every day!  After exhaustive research and test drives of competitors (A6, 5-series, E- series, GS300), arrived at the M as hands-down winner.  Perfect blend of luxury & performance -  with the luxury of a Lexus or MB, performance of a BMW, at a much lower price.  The M has that ""bank vault"" door sound that tells you immediately it's a quality, solid vehicle.  Performance, even with the base 280hp V6, is top in its class. Test drove the V8 also and WHOA, it's scary fast. V6 is plenty for me and probably is for most people.  This car gives BMW a real run for its money.  Drive one before you buy German!"
infiniti,m35,2006,Bob, 10/07/2005,My 06 Infiniti M35,4,This is a classy car.  Great fit and finish inside and out. Has a nice exhaust note.  Engine & Transmission are top notch. Handles like a sports car.  
infiniti,m35,2006,Nick, 10/16/2005,Color me disappointed,3,"After shelling out nearly $50K you expect that all of the features you paid for should work properly. Apparently I was mistaken!    My Bluetooth does not work.   My Nav system works when it wants to.   My sunroof has been replaced twice.   The headliner will not stay in place any longer.   My fuel mileage is in the 12-15 mpg range (not acceptable).   The road noise is loud at freeway speeds.   The ""smart key"" - not so smart   Reverse camera shorts out.   Lane Departure Warning system sounds alarm for no reason.  This car has been a complete disappointment. Infiniti has blamed me for these defects, and they refuse to buy the car back. Run away screaming from your local dealership!"
infiniti,m35,2006,Rod Lindholm, 10/19/2005,M 35 Sport great all around car.,4,I love driving this car. Infiniti nailed the balance between sport and just getting around town.
infiniti,m35,2006,Steve, 11/11/2005,"Great Toy, fun to drive.",4,"Though it lacks the overwhelming sense of power that V8s give there is nothing stodgy about driving the M35.  It corners flat, responds quickly to the accelerator and has every comfort, convenience and entertainment feature known to man."
infiniti,m35,2006,DANIELE, 11/11/2005,Worth it for the money!!!,4,"I looked at the lexus 300 before i bought this one, and the quality was much better with this car, and also 5,000 dollars cheaper with navigation. But i did notice on the downside with this car, the gas mileage is horrible,and the paint is very, very thin on this car, i got a rock chip on the freeway and was shock how thin it was, almost tissue paper thin. But other then that this is fun car to drive. ""I love it"". "
infiniti,m35,2006,cooker, 11/12/2005,Dazzling!,4,"After checking out the Acura TL, Audi A-6, Toyota Avalon and Lexus, IS, the Infiniti was the clear winner.  The manufacturer got just about everything right on this car.  Easy access (I am 6' 2""), great seating position, intuitive electronics and a joy to drive.  And the dealer was superb, knowledgeable, polite, professional and competent.  As mileage is improving with each tank (now up to 20.6 overall mpg), I look forward to driving this car for many years. One suggestion-- do read the owner's manual.  it is written by a native English speaker and will reward the several hours of study..  Great job by the Nissan corporation."
infiniti,m35,2006,Southern Lady, 11/15/2005,Great Gadgets and Fun to Drive,4,"When I decided to trade my Lexus SX430 I thought I was going to end up with a new BMW 5 series but once I looked at one up close I was very disappointed with the interior of the BMW, especially the nav system which is very cumbersome. The saleslady had so much trouble trying to show me how it worked I decided right then and there that it just wasn't for me.  I ended up test driving the M35 and fell in love with the voice activated nav!  I am in real estate and this nav makes my life so much easier.  The car has outrageous power and comfort - love the way it drives and for a gadget lover like me this car is a dream come true.  I have every single option available and I love it.  So much fun!"
infiniti,m35,2006,Laura, 12/08/2005,I now love to drive!!!,5,"I never cared what kind of car I drove just so long as it got me where I needed to be. Not anymore! One test drive in the Infiniti M35 and I had to have it! This car will make your pulse race with the push of it's button! That's right I push a button, I don't turn a key! The leather seats, bose sound system, and voice recognition command system make me feel like I am wrapped in luxury! What more could a girl want?"

HINT Set dvd to auxiliary & plug in I-pod behind console). I Love my M more each day.  HINT- Buy a MP3 file converter for your PC.  I have over 60 tracks on one CD (try doing that with a BMW 5 series!) My school teacher (English major) friends are amazed that the M understands voice commands, They gave up on their 06 BMW 5 series.  I drive them crazy when I say TIRE PRESSURE or DESTINATION CHEESECAKE FACTORY PALM BEACH"" and up pops the screen! I have 50+ dvd-audio/dts discs WOW the sound!"
infiniti,m35,2006,CREDITMAN, 01/12/2006,10 Month & still great,5,"Pick up my m35x on 03-24-05, left next day for 14 day vacation.  Couldn't wait to get back to drive the M.  Had to drive a rental minivan for vacation.  As of today the car has 17,649 mile with no problems what so ever. Avg. mileage is 18.5 to 21.9.  Great performance and handling.  The only complaint I have is that the seat warmer don't get warm enough.  Dealer says it a new system that has a heating plate that warms up and the fan blow the heat up thru the seat.  Still doesn't get a warm as my prior Lexus or my wife'a Audi Allroad"
infiniti,m35,2006,sharbyte, 01/14/2006,Beer Can,4,I have had the car since August and it is fun to drive and built very well for a beer can.  I have had several major door dings and a Dent in the hood from a rock.  In most cars you might have only received a scratch. The hood fix cost $540.  The recent door ding will cost $800. The thing was made from old beer cans if you ask me.  So if you plan on owning one of these you had better save your money to fix what should be minor scratches to fix the dents.  It has ruined the joy of owneing an otherwise fine car.
infiniti,m35,2006,JD, 01/16/2006,M35,4,I have had this vehicle for 8 months. It is far superior in price/value than any of its competitors. Exterior design could have been more bold. Gas mileage could be better. Otherwise an exceptional vehicle.
infiniti,m35,2006,Mark, 01/28/2006,Second Infiniti,4,Owned G35 which I traded in for the new M. M is a much better car. Interesting to see comments from BMW lovers about styling and quality. New 5 series is ugly as sin and has extremely poor quality. Have two neighbors with 5 series and they are constantly in the shop. BMW is the handling king but at what price?
infiniti,m35,2006,ct1211, 01/28/2006,long time BMW convert,4,I had every intention of getting a new BMW 5 series. But its stark interior weird stlying and LACK OF POWER landed me in the infiniti So far 0 problems and the best car I ever owned!

After all that, I had NO hesitations about purchasing the Infinit M. Far more styling and options compared to the others. Down the the littlest of details.  The BMW came closest. Fun to drive (although definitely not as much power as the M), but drab and boring.  I purchased the M35 Sport with all the options.

Leather is soft and rosewood trim is very attractive.  I am getting 19 mpg in the city.  Though some reviews state noisy ride I find the ride quiet and comfortable. Bose system sounds terrific!  I love this car.  "
infiniti,m35,2006,Paul, 02/14/2006,M35 vs. Others in Class,4,"I love my M35 Sport. I made extensive comparisons of the Audi A6, BMW 525, and the Lexus GS300. This car is the best combination of performance, style, comfort, technology and value. None of its competitors could be as well equipped for this price. I have owned it for 9 months and it has not been back to the dealer for any service issues.  I must admit that it is not as much fun to drive as my wife's BMW 325 convertible on a sunny summer day, but for the other 9 months it is a great car."
infiniti,m35,2006,Al Zammit, 03/02/2006,Infiniti Man,4,"The M 35 is my fourth Infiniti since Infiniti first came out. I think this one is by far the best in design, comfort safety and great technology. I moved from Mercedes to Infiniti in 1990 and this M35 is as good if not better than any Mercedes that I have ever owned. "
infiniti,m35,2006,aaficianado, 03/04/2006,"M35 non-sport, Journey Package",4,"Have had the car for 2 months, and have confirmed that I made a very good buying choice. Infiniti has a winner in the M35 ... great quality, all the latest gadgets, quick & responsive performance,  comfortable ride. The journey package sound system is very good .. of course the 14 speaker system is out of this world. And although the price is not cheap, you get great value for your money, compared to other cars in the luxury sports sedan segment. Seriously considered the MB E350 .. great car, but cost a lot more, not as roomy, and poor reliability history."

infiniti,m35,2006,gabby, 03/08/2006,Great but poor ride,3,"Great car but poor gas mileage, a lot of wind noise, noise rough engine. Great handling and great interior. However, would not purchase another one because of the engine and road noise AND fuel economy. 

Very very poor blue tooth technology. Tried every recommended cell phone(which was very expensive) and my calls were mostly to poor to hear or recieve. ""You sound all garbled like you are in a barrel."" I got that all the time no matter where I was. Also tried another cell phone carrier but still the same. If I am going to pay for Blue Tooth techology I expect it to work at least 50% of the time. After all, it is quite expensive. Also, car as died twice had to have it jump- started. Electrical?"

infiniti,m35,2006,debun, 04/13/2006,Love My M,4,"I spent many months researching a lot of different cars and came down to the RL and the M35.  The M35 won out and I cannot be happier.  The dealer had the exact car I wanted (Diamond Graphite with Tech Package).  The ride is solid, the car smooth without taking away the feel of the road and the acceleration is as good as my old TL.   The sound system is awesome and I get lots of envious looks from people everywhere.  I also want to say that the dealer Sewell Infiniti was terrific and they spent over 2 hours before I decided to buy the car just going over all the technology features.  The other dealer I had gone to could not eve find a car with the Tech package."
infiniti,m35,2006,Anthony, 04/29/2006,Infiniti Forever....Dream Come True!!!!!,5,"I've only had my M35x for 3 weeks and I have already vowed I'm never trading this car in!!!!!!! My friend bought a 2006 Volkswagen Passat and I was so jealous because he got his new vehicle before I had even made a choice on what I even wanted!! Went to a dealership on a whem, saw the M and fell head over heels. The premium package is worth every penny and the graphite interior is flawless. The Sound System and navagation is awesome. I just can't explain how much I love this car, its simply Best Luxury Car on the road!!!!!!"
infiniti,m35,2006,AK99, 04/30/2006,Very nice,4,"Very nice car, with strong acceleration and a fantastic navigation system. Seems more special since there aren't that many on the road.  Who knew cool seats would be the coolest feature ever."
infiniti,m35,2006,SteveK, 05/15/2006,"Never again, Lexus",4,"I've had the car for 8 months and taken it on longer trips as well as work, etc. It is so enjoyable; quiet enough but with some road feel. Plenty of power for accelerating or cruising. Seats are fantastic and beautiful interior. Sound system fantastic, especially the 5.1 surround. The Smart Cruise control is great, but still need to turn it off with people coming into your lane. Lane departure is OK, sometimes annoying. Drives like RWD, but AWD worked fine in snow. My favorite all time car was my '91 LS400, and since then also owned an ES300. This has been better! Plus, the dealer makes you feel like it's an honor to have you own their car, not that you should thank them."

I looked at Passat, Audi A6,Mercedes E350, Camary v6 XLE(270 HP), Avalon, Lexus ES350 and a few others.  It camed down to the A6 and the M35 with the journey package an XM.  It was really close. I struggled with the decision.  It came down to cost and and I really wanted that ""Push Button Ignition""  I really enjoy the ride and how the car looks.  So far I am happy with my purchase. "

It has exceeded my expectations in all areas except for gas mileage, which I've been a bit disappointed in (about 19 mpg), considering I'm mostly on freeway (though in LA, its not always open freeway).  Anyway...I almost got the M45, as I wasn't sure this would have enough ooomph, but I've been plenty pleased so far!"
infiniti,m35,2006,firecapt, 06/10/2006,Great car,4,"I have had my m35x about 2 months now and love it, best car i have ever owned. Have had no problems, love the navigation and back up camera. Car has plenty of power and is just fun to drive.Gas mileage is decent for this car, getting 17mpg in town and 24 on the road using mid range gas. Got it with the Journey-Nav package which was just the right package. Get the car you will love it."
infiniti,m35,2006,Reubin, 06/09/2006,M35,4,"M is an excellent value (cheaper by comparison), and fun to drive; Great handling in the canyons of Los Angeles. At 100+ mph handles superbly; you have to put some effort in keeping your speed down."
infiniti,m35,2006,PB, 06/24/2006,sport meets luxury,4,"The more I drive the Sport M35 I love it. It has a tight feel and great pick up. I have owned a lexus ES, LS and 911. The M35 has a real sport feel but all the comfort of a luxury car. Yes it is a little noisy but with the Bose stereo rocking you will never know. The gas mileage is really around 15-20 MPG. Which is weak compared to Lexus and BMW. I did not drive the M45 but the M35 is quick and fast so the M45 must be a rocket.  "
infiniti,m35,2006,donnyd, 06/25/2006,Jack of All Trades,4,"The M35 is the first car I've bought solely for my own driving, and I can't imagine a better fit.  Handling is responsive and firm but not overly stiff, interior room is excellent (I'm 6'3""), and the engine rocks.  It's a Japanese 5-series, folks, but more reliable and frankly, more solid all-around.  Plus, it's 5-10k less expensive.  What else could you want?!"
infiniti,m35,2006,CG91, 06/29/2006,Great Sport Sedan,4,"I leased the Infiniti M35X after test driving the Audi A6 and the Mercedes E350.  All three cars are excellent sport sedans, my decision to go with the Infiniti came down to price.  As a current G35 coupe and FX35 owner the deal I got on the M35X was far better than the Mercedes or the Audi.  The car has excellent handling, ride, engine and transmission.  The Nav and blue tooth work well. The back up camera is a nice feature.  My gas mileage has been about 17 MPG. Voice recognition is good for the nav.  Overall an excellent value for mid luxury sport sedan.  "

The M35 had the best performance, acceleration and technology features than any of these german models. I read consumer reports magazine (oct./nov. 2005 edition) and the m35 came out on top. I read nytimes, usa today columnists and all agree that m35 is the best luxury sedan. HANDS DOWN. I  now cruise in an M35 ivory pearl with 19"" rims, Navigation and Entertainment center and with sport ground effects. This car has bmw drivers' heads turn - both men and women. I go to a night club in LA,OC and Vegas and they valet my M35 in the VIP right next to the upper end benz and 6/7 series bmws. I highly recommend!!"
infiniti,m35,2006,eric, 07/29/2006,Very pleased,4,"I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I tried all 3 M35 models and found the Sport to be equally as comfortable and noticeably more fun to drive.  I got a great deal here in July with the insanely low 24 month no money down lease program.  I test drove the Lexus GS 350 and IS 350 and came back to the M.  It was a combination of value, performance and styling that made me ultimately choose the M over the Lexus models."

I loved the infiniti because I am a big guy and it was comfortable to sit in and the acceleration is amazing and the cornering and drive is amazing.The lexus was okay, but very crappy radio and seemed like a stripped down boring interior.The BMW 5 series was a great drive but the stock radio was horrible and a was not crazy about the new exterior design.The cadillac was okay interior, very nice stock radio, but the drive felt a little to loose and bulky but the Caddy ext. is nice but bulky.Make sure you test drive this car"
infiniti,m35,2006,Guy, 08/16/2006,Nice Change,4,"Great car, has the style of a benz, but misses the looks. The ride is great on a smooth surface, rough on hard roads. Directional tires make the steering a challenge, but im sure this is normal for the tire specs.  Only issue at 7k miles was the trim on the door handles falling off."

Being a technologist and understanding the difficulties to get Voice Recognition to work (have people that design Voice controlled PDAs for me), I am definitely impressed with what they have done in this area.  Just need to learn how to maniulate the controls on the sterring wheel to utilize most of the console system features.  The DVD surrond sound definitely rocks.

Everything has worked as advertised, and no unexpected bad surprises have occurred.  I have owned many high performance luxury cars including several Porsches, Mercedes, Lexus, and other Infinitis.   This one is really fun to drive, reasonably economical to operate, and is a high tech heaven.  Indeed, if I had to find a complaint, it would be that the technology is a little over my head.  I still have not completely figured out how to take advantage of all the high tech features.  Nonetheless, after 6 months of ownership, the car still has a few fun and entertaining secrets and surprises.  Ownership has been a pleasure."

However, after 14 months the tires are worn out completely.  Beware of the Bridgestone tires.  Also, my experience with Infiniti service was not good.  I found them to be  overpriced.  Most of the inspections that Infiniti charges for in their service plan are provided free by GMC for my Yukon.   Stay away from Infiniti service! "

Price was a bonus.  Have owned BMW and find the driving experience comparable, technology and reliability is top notch and beyond the German cars. Styling is a bland compared to others (Audi). Initially, I thought interior was busy but quickly found out it is very logically laid out. Have tried to like i-drive and mmi but just doesn't make sense to me... Overall, great execution.

I'm a bigger guy (6' 225 lb) and this car fits me like a glove

"
infiniti,m35,2007,DomAMarc, 10/22/2006,Unique choice,4,"Uses a modified version of the platform in the 350Z and the G35 and shares some of their sporty and rough-around-the- edges ""muscle-car"" characteristics, while also overlapping some with German premium brands -- but without matching their finesse, quiet smoothness, and ""aristocratic"" style. You only get a five (not 6) speed manually shift-able automatic transmission, so highway mileage suffers; but, this car is all about fast acceleration, not about finesse or keeping mpg over 20. Inside, it has many of the upscale electronics you'd expect from Japan, yet includes a lot of the old-fashioned buttons too which I found tedious but some might like as familiar."
infiniti,m35,2007,Jeffrey S, 02/06/2017,Great Car!,5,"I've owned my 2007 Infiniti M35x for 3 years.  I bought it with 86,000 miles and have put on an additional 50,000.  In that time I've replaced the brakes rotors and pads, tires, and 2 front wheel bearings.  Nothing out of the ordinary for a car of that age with that many miles on it.  This car could seriously get you into trouble!  The acceleration is very impressive, highway acceleration/passing and on-ramp merging is a breeze.  The only thing I'm not all that impressed with is the bluetooth technology and navigation are a bit primitive, but that's only because of the fact it's a 2007.  I'm not all that impressed with the factory stereo by Bose, and would have gotten the upgrade if I bought the vehicle new.  Repairs are expensive when they happen, but frequency is very rare as long as you maintain the car and keep up regular schedules.  I take very good care of my vehicles and use only synthetic for oil changes and keep a strict schedule on tire balance and rotations.

Thought it was too big but after sitting in it, I decided I had to test drive it.  After test driving it, I was sold. Nearly 2 years later I am still mostly pleased.  I find the exterior design a little boring and sometimes feel it looks like an over-priced, glorified Nissan. Interior is beautiful, very comfortable and roomy.   ISSUES: All my wood-panel veneers (on doors) popped off, had to be replaced.  Have trouble with programmed seats (using key), begins adjusting as programmed then just stops.  Always had a noticeable  miss/hesitation at @ 38 mph, dealer says nothing is wrong."

I drive my cars to the end of their repair life, meaning to a major failure usually it's the transmission. I've never had engine blow, but every American car I've owned had it's transmission fail well under 200k, most around 125k - 150k, not bad but this Infiniti continues to amaze me, no major repairs due to wear.  I did replace a CV joint but only because the boot was torn probably kicked up on the road.

The navigation algorithms are not so great, it's ok in a pinch, my phone is better.   I would buy this car again, or the M37 with low mileage, it will just go forever!

Overall it has been a very satisfying, reliable and fun to drive car. Unlike others here who complain about gas mileage, I have averaged 22.8 mpg on REGULAR unleaded in mixed driving since the car had 1,000 miles on the odometer. My complaint is road noise and tires. Replaced the Goodyear RSA's at 41,000 when the noise got unbearable. Now with Cooper Zeons and another 21,000 the noise is back in spades. Likely will switch to Michelin MXVs. Only warranty issue has been replacing the 4 wooden door trims. Still have not replaced brake pads. Oil changes & filter changes only. Car uses no oil--a real driver's motor."

infiniti,m35,2007,Frank, 05/22/2018,"owned for 10 years, 104K miles: Great car",5,"To me, Infiniti hit a home run with this model. My previous car was a 1996 Acura RL that I owned for 10 years. This M35 outperforms and outclasses the RL in almost every way. Let's start with the VQ35 engine: just an awesome running and sounding motor. Uses zero oil after 104K miles with my own synthetic blend oil changes. Quality of leather and other materials is outstanding. Car has had only two very minor factory recalls, plus the Takata airbag recall. Compared to the new model, the Q60, I'd rather hold onto my M35 and keep it in top running condition. I replaced all struts and shocks with KYB Excels at 102K. My preventive maintenance on this car has served me well--no breakdowns and very few repairs in 10 years. It's too bad that Infiniti has de-contented the Q60 to keep the price down. I love the M35.

infiniti,m35,2007,Jae, 07/07/2018,Great Car But dont buy it with high miles,3,"Based off of personal views, this car is amazing in terms of speed and torque for the price, compared to new makes and models of vehicles. My car was awd but bought with 164,000 miles under its belt. This lead to the obvious wear and tear of the vehicle, the cost of repair was a bit ridiculous so if you don't want to blow a ton of cash out of pocket I'd suggest finding a cheaper more reliable car. As for gas per mile, it was a guzzler, like most 3.5ls I'd fill my take premium about twice a week. I strongly suggest that even with the slightest sound or noise you hear, take it straight to the mechanic because they are built very fragile and once one thing fails so does 100 other things that go unannounced, and get your oil and tune-ups serviced as soon as the sticker states.

infiniti,m35,2007,gato1, 10/28/2009,Not bad at all,4,"So far the car is great, love the navigation and the voice commands. My bluetooth is flawless and clear. The high intensity lights are amazing, very comfy ride with a 3.5 v6 backing you up when you need it. It could be a little more sporty, like the G35 but over all you will turn heads inside and outside the car. So far I am not trilled with the dealers service, I had an acura and I was treated like royalty. Infiniti seems to fight you on every issue and I found most representatives rude (except my sales guy). The M35 is a great value for the money you pay. Psx2 no ipod connection!! Grrrrrr."
infiniti,m35,2007,Mike, 01/12/2010,Happy,4,"My wife and I went to the Inifinti dealership to buy a G37 convertible and she saw this CPO 2007 M35x with the Umbria Gray paint and Bourbon Interior sitting there and she was smitten. We took it for a test drive and were sold. I traded my 2003 FX-45 on the spot and have been very happy. Actually I had traded my 2002 Q-45 on the FX-45 after a bad snowstorm a couple of years back where the RWD Q was a real scary ride. The M has many of the fine feature I missed in the Q but with AWD and much better fuel economy. I know, getting a car like this a worrying about fuel economy is a bit ridiculous. But its a great ride, and after last week's snowstorm I love it even more."
infiniti,m35,2007,David, 01/29/2010,Many quality issues,4,"I purchased this car new and 2.5 years and 25K miles in many quality issues have popped up. The ""genuine"" rosewood veneer on the interior of both front doors peeled off due to faulty adhesive and needed to be replaced around 15K miles. The left rear shock developed a horrible rattle at about 12K miles. The dealer just isolated the issue and will replace the shock, but Infiniti will only pay for the replacement of the faulty shock, not both rear shocks. This is the equivalent of replacing one tire.

This car has the performance of Rear-Wheel Drive and when you need it, All- Wheel.  The tech toys are awesome.  The car came with the Technology package with Sirius radio.  I didn't think it was necessary for the Cruise control, Lane Departure system or the DVD player (I would've liked the 5.1 Surround, but not that big of a deal considering the package is $3300).  The bluetooth system is way better than the Maximas, and the voice recognition is pretty accurate, although when calling, its not that great, but whatever."
infiniti,m35,2007,Robert Coin, 08/26/2007,"Good and bad, good wins.",4,"Fun car to drive. Excellent acceleration. Transmission crisp. Car handles very well for an AWD car. Battery was dead 2 hours after delivery. Incredibly, seat climate control fan does not turn off when the car engine is shut down. The fan drained the battery. This is an incomprehensible flaw. Floor width for feet is too narrow for big feet. Nav is easy to use, but typical of these systems, it is rife with errors on street names. It even has the wrong designation for a local interstate highway. It has mislocated the car off the road twice so far. These systems still have a long way to go. Car should be quieter. Mileage okay so far. Flaws do not distract from an otherwise excellent car. Enjoy car."
infiniti,m35,2007,Dennis, 07/31/2007,Just the Facts,4,"I tried very hard to replace my G35 with a german automobile (bmw, mb, audi) but I just could not do it. (That 3 series turbo is really sweet.) Infiniti is doing as good a job for a much better price. Why pay more for equivalent product? M35 is a sharp looking car with a sweet engine, a nice ride and a beautiful interior. The Rosewood with graphite leather is impressive to behold. Gas mileage is not really good. Plenty of room throughout, unless you are a very big person you should find this car's size suitable. If you desire a really nice car for a fair market price (they are in business to make a profit after all) then look at an M35."
infiniti,m35,2007,John Lellis, 01/01/2018,Nice ride,5,"Don't expect great mileage, especially in city driving.  But, other than that disappointment, this car has been the best I've owned in a long time.  I hope the car I replace it with will be as good to me as this one has been.  I was especially pleased with the service I received during the recent air bag recall.  Such treatment makes me want to visit my Infiniti dealer first when thinking of replacing my M35.

Dealer repolished all 4 scraped rims, fixed driver door actuator and rear door plate. Took almost two weeks but satisfied now. Had a Volvo prior (174K) which had made me antsy about the high rpm revving (3-4K) of this vehicle (normal?) when going stop to say 25-30 mph. Other than the above, satisfied with the car, radio, gps, a/c, etc... Knew mileage would be low going in. Will see how things go as time and miles build up. Have put 2K miles in the 8 wks I have had the car. Have put the Volvo out of mind weeks ago, hopefully will last as long... time wise..."

It's a beautiful and powerful car, BUT I have been very disappointed in the ride quality and fuel mileage. The stiff suspension and low profile tires beat you to death on the highway. It is not a comfortable car to take on long road trips. When we have to drive any distance we drive my Honda Ridgeline. It has a smoother and more comfortable ride by far.

Extremely poor gas mileage.  My commute consist of about 3.5 miles of local driving and 21 miles of freeway driving. I noted that I am only getting 17 miles per gallon.  Perhaps my aggressive driving contributes to this factor.  But my Maxima with VQ35DE engine (same 3.5 Litter engine at M35) which has 20 less horse power gets about 23.5 miles average miles.

I have been fairly happy with my vehicle except for the front sport seats and fuel economy.  The car is fun to drive and has lots of great features.  However, the piping / stitching on the upper portion of the front seats hits beneath my shoulder blade causing pain and stiffness to my shoulder and neck. This car should have a 6 speed automatic transmission to help fuel economy.  I will not buy another M35 Sport unless it has a 6 speed auto transmission."

infiniti,m35,2007,JohnK, 10/06/2008,It's no Lexus,3,"UPDATE: Back in March of this year I wrote a review of our M35 AWD and complained about, among other things, the poor gas mileage.  In all fairness I need to report that somewhere around 9K miles the mileage improved.  I now get a solid 21 mpg of mixed driving and 22.5 mpg highway.  This is with premium fuel and driving driven conservatively.  I still blame the AWD for a 2 mpg loss and would encourage new car buyers to press their dealer for rear wheel drive cars.  With modern traction control, there is very little real world benefit to AWD.  And given the obvious need to conserve fuel, AWD just cant be justified, in my humble opinion. The nature of this car makes it tiring to drive."
infiniti,m35,2007,M.D, 10/05/2009,Do not buy Infiniti,2,"I got my M35X only because I am 6 foot 2 inch tall and it seemed to be roomy from inside and after driving it for few thousands miles I noted that the engine is very noisy with annoying riddling noise, took it to the dealer and they changed the intake, did solve the problem, changed the exhaust did not solve the problem, so finally they called it a character of the cars and I have to accept that, I will try to trade it for any other car. So my advice is to stay away from any Infiniti. I don't recommend it at all. Be smart and pay a little more and get a better car to enjoy not to spend a lot of time in the dealership or over the phone to work on the car. It is bad bad bad quality cars."

But Bluetooth is a trademark that requires interoperability.  Finally they agreed to repair it.  This took 4 tries.  Then my AC condenser was pierced by a stone.  They refused warranty repair because ""stone chips"" are excluded. This is understandable for paint not for an internal part they should protect with grill work.  That's a design defect.  Their voice recognition for phone numbers is awful.  The gas mileage is lower than a good design could have made it."

The dealer had to bring in some experts who diagnosed a failure of the lower bearings.  The engine was torn apart and they rebuilt the bottom end.  The dealer said is was about a $5000 repair, covered under warranty, of course.  The service manager suspected it was a factory defect and checking their computer database, there have been about 10 similar problems throughout the US.  The dealer was good to work with.  They took my initial concerns seriously and didn't try to kiss it off.  They provided a G35 loaner.  The car now has 8000 miles and there have been no further problems.  "
infiniti,m35,2007,M35Bloomington, 02/28/2007,"Dealer's ""brand experience"", Poor",3,"Driving Experience disappoints, primarily as a result of local dealers poor customer response.   The tranny &/or torque converter pulsation at 36- 38 MPH is irritating, denied by the new car sales mgr at dealer (Why do you drive 38 MPH? Where's that speed limit?) yet 1st service visit, advisor comments as ""an unfortunate spec"" that he's  heard of often. Very foul odor, when car is parked for 2-3 days, thru ventilation system.  The stereo sound quality is not as good as vehicles with half the price and that's with the '07 Tech II package.  Overall, the brand and the product is overmarketed and the treatment by the dealership employees is one of arrogance vs listening, recording and addressing."

Averaged 24.2 mpg which is better than expected, averaging 56 mph (lots of 80 mph cruising). I'm 6'3"" and 250 lbs, and there is plenty of room.  This is the most comfortable car I've owned.

Whatever, it is a great car with every feature I could want (and some I didn't know I wanted or needed).  The car came equipped with both the technology and advanced technology package.  The surround sound system is OK, the navi is very good, and the overall comfort level is excellent.

infiniti,m35,2007,Uncle Dan, 07/04/2008,Does Infiniti make red lemons?,4,"This is a follow-up from a previous review in which I described a major engine problem at 5,000 miles.  The selling dealership had to repair a faulty main bearing which they claimed was a factory defect.  The problem surfaced after a 5,000 mile road trip.  At 9,500 miles I began another long road trip.  After arriving in Sacramento on Day 1, smoke was coming from the engine compartment.  Fortunately there was a dealership nearby.  They had to replace a blown transmission seal.  In both instances, the dealerships were very good about repairing the problem, but I have lost confidence in being able to go out of town.  My question to Infiniti is, do you occasionally grow lemons in all colors?"
infiniti,m35,2007,Alan, 07/11/2008,2007 Infiniti M35,4,"Purchase based in part on Consumer Reports review.  Considered BMW 535 and MB E-350.  No defects to date.  Outstanding GPS user interface to all electronic functions.  So intuitive no need to read the manual.  Laser speed control is absolutely wonderful and works perfectly in all kinds of traffic.  Front seats are perfect for 6 footer.  Handles like you're riding on rails.  Excellent self centering of steering on the highway.  Excellent acceleration.  21 MPG.  Stereo a bit weak in highs.  Road noise need reduction.  Brakes are perfect.  Add a sixth gear and reduce the RPM (gear ratio) in top gear on highway.  Love the rear view camera, exc fit and finish, beautiful design. Would buy again."
infiniti,m35,2007,John, 09/05/2008,2007 Infiniti M35 3.5 V6 5A,4,"Coming from a G35 the M35 is not nearly as peppy. The M feels like a luxo boat taking off. Would prefer the 330HP G37 engine. Besides that, I love the room as I am 6'5''. The M needs another gear (although it looks like the 7 speed will be out soon). The user interface is easy to use. The fit and finish are excellent and love the wood. The other reason I got the M was because of the heating/cooling seats, works ok, was expecting little. The steering is not as tight as the G which is a slight disappointment."
infiniti,m35,2007,mathwonk, 04/22/2009,Not what I hoped for,4,"This car reviewed well and was available used at a good price.  On brief test drive it seemed like a BMW 5 series clone and we bought it, anticipating a BMW like car with better reliability.  It pleased for a while, but eventually began to feel like a big washy boat when being driven.  We also noticed the price we pay for the exceptional headroom inside is a high roof and less front visibility over the hood.  This is a good car but I am still paying for it and my wife has already lost her fascination with it.  A BMW it ain't, in spite of reviews comparing them.  Now I don't know what to aspire to, since BMW has been producing a technically clunky car lately that doesn't crash test well."

The ESC and lane departure features keep you safer and I love the GPS.  Bought my son a Garmin for his car, and still think mine is better.  I love the Bluetooth!

Bose sound system is quite amazing for a car, especially with the dvd-audio discs. It (read: the V6) is a bit noisy when on full trottle, but very quick accelleration in return. Battery drained twice, one time when I left the car lights on, the other when I somehow did not close it properly in my garage. All in all a very decent car. As a European I wouldn't say its 100% up to the built quality of Audi/BMW/Mercedes, however it makes up in being fully loaded at $55k. Fuel economy is fairly poor, but at $2.5 0/gallon its ok (vs $8/gallon in Europe). Highly recommended."

Previously drove an Audi A6 2.7t and this car blows it out of the water in terms of looks, performance, features, standard equipment...everything.  Was also considering the Lexus GS 350 awd..both comparably priced with similar features.  Depends on what you want in a car...if you want more sportier characteristics def go with the M35x.  Don't even bother with the BMW 530ix!  Even the G35 is roomier inside than the BMW.  Exterior styling on the M35x could, however, be a bit more daring...bit too conservative to make it stand out in a crowd."

Only car that came close to this one was the BMW 530 which was a bit more comfortable with slightly better handling.  However, it was $10,000 more and didn't have all the bells and whistles like the heated/cooled front seats.  Also don't understand why Germans keep putting their cruise control on an awkward stalk rather than the steering wheel and use those flimsy cup holders. Can't understand why American producers don't get the message.  Cadillac and Lincoln couldn't even come close."

infiniti,m35,2007,dzohio, 03/28/2007,M35x vs BMW 530,4,"I used to have an '04 530I. I really like the M tho. Looks great! Interior is awesome. Plenty of room. Gas mileage is horrendous. Averaging 17-18 mpg. Engine performance over 75mph is poor. It should have 6 gears. If you floor it at 75mph or higher, you'll go nowhere. But the M is still a sexy beast. It lacks some of the finer BMW features and sportiness. Couple of cheap interior parts. Stereo is pretty bad in base package. Expected more from $40k car. Nonetheless I'm happy with my purchase. Voice recog is pretty cool. Bluetooth is just average."

The M35 is more fun, much more powerful, and has great features like the voice commands and bluetooth. But it is a bear when it comes to gas consumption. It gets only 18 miles per gallon on the highway and 15 mpg in the city. The bluetooth often disengages even though used with a recommended cellphone. Conclusion: I should have bought the I30 that I was leasing which had only 13,000 miles at the end of a 39 month lease!"
infiniti,m35,2007,olivia.s614, 03/28/2007,I love this car!,4,"I read a lot of reviews and test drove this car twice, along with the BMW 540i, Audi A4, Acura TSX, and Lexus GS350. This is by far my favorite of all of them. It is just as fun to drive, handles great, but has the benefit of an amazing interior design. The navigation is by far the best I've ever seen in any car, voice controls work well, and it has a very easy to use interface. I would recommend this car to anyone who is willing to spend the money for a luxury sports sedan.  Bravo Infiniti for producing yet another great vehicle!"
infiniti,m35,2007,CHAMILTON, 04/07/2007,Waste of Money for a Luxury Vehicle,3,"To be a luxury vehicle, ride is harsh and rough. Very noisy.  Seats are very hard and uncomfortable.  Poor gas mileage. Traded in a Lexus, very poor decision on my part."
infiniti,m35,2007,Bob, 06/11/2007,A Very Well Thought Out Design,4,"I drove all the competitors. It came down to three:  Lexus GS 350, MB E-Class and the M35. After driving all of them back to back several times, in different conditions and roads, I liked a fully loaded M35 the best and it started out in 3rd place. As I spent more time with each, the strong and weak points became more apparent. As I became more familar with each car the following is what made the M stand out. Size and comfort of seats. Flexibility of driver positions, due to more head room. More backseat legroom. User friendly instrument panel. It is fun and a pleasure to drive. Also see below. A trip to L.A from S.F. gave 23 mpg round trip w/ mixed driving. One way 24 mpg @ 75mph."

infiniti,m35,2007,Bill, 08/09/2007,Great vehicle,4,"The seats are exceedingly comfortable.  The handling is fabulous for a 4000 lb vehicle.  6 speeds would be better for gas mileage.  I average 20.5 in mixed driving. The transmission does downshift too readily, but you can override this with the manual.  Bluetooth and nav are great and easy to operate. Don't use monosyllabic words/names for voice recognition with phone calls, it likes to substitute numbers sometimes.  Great vehicle!"

infiniti,m35,2007,jj, 07/27/2007,For what you get its a good buy,4,"We just purchased an M35x with AWD.  So far we are satisfied with this car.  It's fun to drive, the engine is extremely powerful, and it's very comfortable.  Compared to other sedans in its class the M is probably the best value for your dollar.  It has a high resale value (not that we want to get rid of it) and it's got all the features that the competitors offer for a much better price.  So far the only complaint with this car is the gas mileage.  But that was to be expected and so it doesn't come as a shock.  So overall I would say that this is a great car.  We already have one SUV so a sedan with AWD is just what we needed.  "
infiniti,m35,2007,BCORIG, 09/03/2007,Fun,4,"M35 for 22 months: Pearl with tan interior (looks larger than the darker ones). Get a bra. Still feels new. Can't wait to drive it every morning. Wax it once a week. Better at high speeds - 100 MPH sneaks up on you. Plenty of HP - makes you want to do things you shouldn't. Mileage better than expected: 20 MPG around town (40% fwy 60% surface streets); 26 MPG averaging 79 MPH Chino to Vegas or Fresno. Really fun on Interstate 15 past Barstow. E350 , 525i RL and A6 were the other choices. Glad I got the M35. What would I add? 6th gear for the highway Automatically locking/unlocking doors."
infiniti,m35,2007,Roger Colla, 09/16/2007,Take a long test drive,4,"The car feels like it was designed to impress car testers rather than real world   driving.  I traded from a 10 year old BMW 540i and would take the old car back in a minute.  The V8 BMW got 20% better gas mileage and rode better.  The M handles better than the BMW but at the cost of a very harsh ride, loud tire noise and VERY twitchy steering. The car has no ""on center"" feel and you have to constantly apply steering input to keep it going straight which is very tiring after an hour of driving. Considering the price, I can live with everything but the steering.  Make sure you take a long drive on the freeway before buying.  Otherwise a great car $10000 cheaper than the competition."
infiniti,m35,2007,mrP, 09/14/2007,Great car but needs some work,4,"I have 6K miles on it and have enjoyed every mile that I've driven. Ivory pearl with tan leather and wood looks beautiful, but the leather gets dirty very quickly. The car handles great and when you go too crazy, the stability control kicks in just in time. I had to replace the windshield after 300 miles because the first rock that hit it caused a crack all the way across. "

The gas mileage is horrible (worse than some SUVs).  Sticker said 18 mpg in city, even with very gentle driving I only get 15 or 16 mpg.  Road noise and engine noise are a little more than I expected but not bad.  Could use an extra gear.  If you step on it to pass at 65 mpg, you're not really going to go anywhere fast."
infiniti,m35,2007,Car Lover, 03/24/2008,Fantatsic Car (Almost),4,"Purchased a black M35 with Journey package 10 months ago after looking at Lexus, BMW, MB and Acura. M35 is the best car for the money. Fun to drive. Exterior styling while not ""special"" still gets a lot of looks. Sneaks up to 85 mph+ with no effort (feels like driving 70 mph).  There is an annoying high frequency rattle in the display screen area while traveling on a rough highway such as Texas' ""chip and seal"" surface.  The dealer has not been able to correct the rattle without tearing down the dashboard. Otherwise the car has been fantastic during its first 13,000 miles.  Mileage has been low as expected (~18 mpg city, ~24 mpg highway)."
infiniti,m35,2007,JohnK, 03/27/2008,Disappointing,3,"The M is beautiful at rest. The interior is wonderfully lighted at night. Automotive art. Start it though, and youd be happier in a Toyota pickup truck. The M is jittery over any road not glass smooth.  Steering requires a lot of attention and correction. The nearly constant drone of the engine is unnecessary, distracting and unwelcome. Until you get used to it, you may find yourself double checking your blind spots looking for what must surely be a motorcycle nearby. Barely 20mpg of premium fuel for mostly highway driving driven conservatively. I fault the AWD for at least 2 mpg of that. Anyway, I should have kept my 1999 Lexus GS. Oh, thats right, I did.  Thank goodness. "
infiniti,m35,2007,Vince, 03/29/2008,Awesome Ride,4,"What a fun car to drive I have a big smile on my face when driving my M35. We have tested the X3, Volvo S80, MDX, Avalon, GS 350 and the M35 was the best bang for the buck, roomier then most others in the same class. It seems like that most carmakers make the cars smaller and smaller hope that Infiniti stays with their roomier layout I love the Lexus GS but it is too small for me. I am getting AVG of 20.6 mpg will try manual shifting see if I get a better mileage. I tinted the windows and it looks so cool, this car rocks."
infiniti,m35,2007,Farman22, 04/13/2008,The Car For the Money,4,"Bought a used 07 M35x 2 weeks ago after an exhaustive search.  The highs are interior, front seat room (lots of headroom for me 6'6"" - better than SUVs!!).  Fun to drive - tight.  Looks great with the possible improvement being the rear. Things to improve. Nav: my garmin is much better.  Bluetooth doesn't understand any voice commands (Go Home = Call Mom).  I get 21 mpg not great but knew that going in.  What makes this car very desirable is 60k mile warranty, tops in reliability and Consumer Reports rating the unchanged 08 model as 2nd only to the LS 460.  Bought mine for $31.5k with 19k miles. Couldnt be happier.  Using regular gas with no knocking. Tight handling/low clearance."

Saw this beauty at the same dealer and took it for a drive on a day it was freezing cold and snowy. The salesman immediately suggested turning on the 4-wheel drive as we were spinning Just trying to get out of the mounds of snow in the lot. Immediately we pulled out with no issues. Where I live in Wisconsin, we gets lots of snow, so this is a huge plus. Great heater (almost too good) and the heated (and cooled) seats work great and make it even more of a pleasure to drive. And drive it does!  Awesome pickup and performance as well as the above mentioned great traction control. But, it does come at a big price at the pump. Premium works best and it likes to drink it!   I find the car extremely comfortable and it gets a lot of attention around town for the styling.  Unfortunately the closest dealer is over 50 miles drive from here. Makes getting dealer service difficult.

infiniti,m35,2007,Walter Joshi, 02/23/2019,2nd time around just as good,5,"This is my 2nd M35X. My first was a 2006. I got that in 2008 with 26k miles after someone totaled my Lexsus GS300. This car was far superior in handling and finish.  I put on another 250k miles for a total of 276k miles. It never gave me any issues. It was simply the best car i have ever owned. I knew that i was pushing my luck at over a quarter million miles so when a 2007 model came up with 76k miles i bought it. This new (old) car is just as sweet to drive. I almost bought a M37 but I'm so happy to be with what i consider an old friend in the comfort and confidence i have in driving this car. Might possibly be one of the best and most underrated cars ever made. Don't forget that Consumer reports gave it the best in class two years in a row for 2005 and 2006.

Only downside to this car is that it's a bit thirsty.  Over many, miles we've been averaging 19-20 MPG.  However, this is probably the last series that still runs on REGULAR gas....and runs well.

Infiniti had no problem replacing them.
At 65K miles the front left wheel bearing went.
Haven't ever had that happen on any other car.
At 80K miles the transmission went - not in any forward gear, but in reverse? I generally keep my cars for 150K miles and I've never had transmission problems or even had to change a clutch. Needless to say, I'm disappointed."

Every time I drive it, the high quality interior, the quick acceleration, the sharp handling, the easy-to-use controls and the OUTSTANDING sound system featuring the music box (no more CDs!,) tell me that this is the car for me. I'm 6'5"" so comfort is important to me. I always feel comfortable, even after driving 2-3 hours straight. Gas mileage could be a bit better, but it's not a deal breaker. Just a great overall sports sedan."
infiniti,m35,2008,Dave, 12/16/2008,Could not pass this up,4,"The economy stinks right now, and I was able to get a 2008 M35 with about 10,000 miles for what I thought was a ridiculously low price.  We were looking at Honda CRVs and other mini SUVS (loaded). I hate SUVs and convinced my wife that this was the car to buy - and now she loves it.  The driving experience is almost as good as the BMW 745, and it has a ton of features.  I recommend the base model because the sport model has a really stiff ride.  It has a nice, isolated yet sporty feel.  For the money, I don't think you can beat it.  Against its competitive set, it is a good value and a great car, but at the prices you can get now it is probably unbeatable."
infiniti,m35,2008,NAIHOXI, 03/16/2009,"Excellent Electronics, Poor Handling",4,"The M35 AWD is an electronics powerhouse with an amazing array of safety and convenient features. Unfortunately, it suffers from a serious steering problem, called tramlining, which makes the handling not only unsatisfactory but also dangerous. I replaced tires twice before I learned from a conscientious mechanic of an Infiniti dealership that the problem is with the steering rack, which Nissan refuses to replace. Based on this shortcoming, I would place a BMW and an Audi ahead of an Infiniti. "
infiniti,m35,2008,Dan Swantko, 01/22/2019,One of the best,5,"This vehicle is the most maintenance-free, reliable vehicle I've ever owned and I've owned two cadillacs, two lincolns, a pontiac, a ford and a volkswagon.  The Infinity wins, hands down.  One mechanical failure in 10 years of ownership - a radiator leakage.   The car still runs like new but I'm getting old and would like one last car before I throw in the towel and am considering a used Infinity Q70.  That would cap my driving history off nicely. The M35 now has 148,000, all without repairs.  Maybe I'll keep it for a while longer.

infiniti,m35,2008,Miketnsa1, 01/28/2019,Can't Stop Driving it!,5,"I acquired this immaculate one owner car in November 18' from a neighbor with 32k original miles.  My intention was to flip the car, but I can't stop driving it as it now has 45k on the odometer!
The engine was a little rough at idle but that changed instantly with the first fill up of 93 Oct Fuel which my neighbor wasn't using.
We just drove a 2019 E300 Mercedes for about 3wks while my Wife's car was in service.  And if you ignore the Mercedes eye candy like the huge screen and awesome ambient lighting is was clear our 11yr old M35 was quieter, and handled better, and was more powerful than the $66,000 E300.
And I recently read that the term, ""No replacement for displacement"" was a myth today.  That smaller 4cyl engines can now perform better than V6's and some V8's...WRONG!
There's a HUGE difference between a Mercedes 2.0L and my Infinity 3.5L...
It's not just how fast a car gets to 60mph? How many times have you ever waited for the stoplight to turn green and then put your foot to the floor for 6 to 7 seconds? If your like 99% of America... NEVER!
The tiny 2.0L 4 cylinder Turbo in the 2019 sounds like a cheap sewing machine at idle.  The Infinity M35's 75% larger V6 sounded much more substantial and smooth. Under moderate acceleration the Mercedes sounded loud and cheap like a entry level 4cyl economy car.  The M35 under moderate acceleration will make you smile with an exhaust growl that is indeed music to the ears.  However, under normal acceleration it is very quiet.
Hwy cruising in the Mercedes on lightly rolling hills between San Antonio and Dallas the E300 did not have the power to hold 9th gear.  It had to gear down to 8th and sometimes 7th gear to maintain 75mph...
I just took the M35 on a trip from San Antonio to Ohio where there are much steeper grades.  And even on the steepest grades in Tenn and KY the Mighty 3.5L pulled every hill without gearing down even once! (there is no replacement for displacement) This M35 pulls hills at highway speeds like our 2012 Mercedes Turbo Diesel S Class, and it has a massive 455ft if torque.  I can't speak for any late model Infinity cars.  Sales lately are dismal to say the least, but if Infinity made a car like this 08' M35 today with modern ambient lighting, larger Nav screens etc. I don't think they'd have any trouble matching the E300 in sales.  Because, (minus the eye candy) this 08' M35 is MORE car than the 2019 Mercedes E300.  
The bottom line...If I had spent $66k on a new E300 and then drove a low mileage Infinity M35 it would have made it hard to live with my new E300.  Especially considering that the first day depreciation of an E300 luxury sedan is more than the entire purchase price of an outstanding low Mileage preowned Infinity M35!

Response is quick and braking is very good too!  The only slight disappointment is road noise but that is expected considering the performance handling assets.  Overall, the car is unbelievably quick and the Bose sound system is one of the best I've ever seen in a luxury vehicle.  We've only put 10K miles and dependability seems to be there.  Dealing with the dealer on maintenance issues has been pleasant but not cheap.  I would recommend this vehicle for one whose tired of the basic economic family car, tired of the SUV mode, and the best value."

Everything else about the car from the handling, comfort, appearance and space is fantastic.  I am a big guy (6'3"") and I have plenty of room  for me and the person sitting behind me.

We drove it for a day and were hooked. They gave it to me for 20K less than new. They gave me 10K for my Buick and I was stunned. I drove this out of there in mint condition for 30K Canadian.

I think it is a safety feature and I will not buy a car without it. I want navigation and satellite radio. I want rear, side, etc air bags. I want electric mirrors, electric cool & heated seats. I want a quiet and not-underpowered car. I do not want to spend 1 cent on fluff (sport packages, chrome wheels, etc) I am over 40."
infiniti,m35,2008,M35 Sport, 09/09/2008,2008 M35 Sport,4,"Just purchased an M35 with the Tech and Sport package and I love the car.  It is a perfect combination of sport and comfort.  My previous two cars were an 04 Acura TL and 01 BMW 530i.  I considered the Lexus GS and BMW 528i.  The Lexus was not sporty enough and the BMW was not as good a value.  With the Tech and Sport package this car has all the goodies I wanted at a great price.  This is a car my whole family likes.  Plenty room in the back for my thirteen year old daughter and her friends.  All the technology a thirteen would want.  My wife enjoys the heated and cooled seats (Texas) as well as the navigation, bluetooth, sat radio and iPod connection and we all like being seen in it."
infiniti,m35,2008,Jes, 09/09/2008,Almost there,4,"This car is almost perfect if you want a more sporty ride.  The suspension, gearing and exhaust all are more sport oriented than the Lexus type comfort some may anticipate.  The steering is the only non-sporty aspect of the M35.  It is overly sensitive and loose at center.  Constant correction is required at highway speed.  The V6 leaves you wanting at times, but that is why they offer a V8.  The car needs more gears.  The new FX 7 speed transmission should fix this.  The M35 cost less than some of its competitors but I think it lacks a few features if you look closely.  Infiniti is learning and will pull it all together with the next iteration."
infiniti,m35,2008,MrBTJ, 09/28/2008,It's good but...,4,Purchased the M35 with the technology package in July (08). For the most part it is a lovely car but it seems like it is missing some comfort items. It swallows gasoline instead sipping on it. The ride is nice and quiet and it has PLENTY of room inside and a ton of style outside. 
infiniti,m35,2008,Tony, 10/24/2008,Great Value,4,"We purchased the M35 since it was such a great value at the time compared to the Mercedes E350 we almost bought.  The M35 feels solid with predictable handling, and the optional technology and advanced technology packages round out the car well.  While not as quiet and smooth as the E350, it's a solid car with respectable performance and comfort.  Reliability likely won't be a concern, with a standard 60K mile warranty.  Wind noise is somewhat noticeable at highway speeds, gas mileage a bit disappointing, and the performance tires transmit some road noise into the cabin.  But for the deals that Infiniti is offering right now, it was simply a no-brainer.  A fine car and a no-regrets purchase."
infiniti,m35,2008,rkon, 11/05/2008,My 3rd Infiniti,4,M35x drives real nice. Sporty and firm ride with no body roll.  Plenty of amenities with navigation system. This is a sporty car with a growl and not a smooth and quiet ride. 
infiniti,m35,2008,Infiniti4Ever, 12/06/2008,M35,4,"My M35 has been a pleasant car. As someone going for more of a relaxed ride, the M35 was nice, but I wish it would be a just a bit more soft. Then again, this is a sports car, and performs like one too. The interior is beautiful, the navigation is nice, and the rear seat room is actually quite good. HOWEVER, this car is a gas machine. If you want a fuel efficient car, look toward buying maybe a GS. I've gotten a combination of 18 mpg, which was expected, but disappointed because it's only a V6."
infiniti,m35,2008,Pinspector, 12/13/2008,Good in almost all aspects,4,"We bought the M35x in October which means it was almost last years car. Problem was tramlining, or the movement of the car over uneven pavement.  Ever drive on a highway that's been used by a lot of trucks. This car will jump all over the place. I researched and got the tires replaced with Michelins by dealer.  Tramlining decreased by about 75%!  Yes, this car eats gas.  My 04 Murano with same VQ35 engine gets a lot better mileage.  A lot more comfortable than our 2003 Mercedes C320 and hopefully a lot more reliable. I didn't want AWD but in NJ all that's available is AWD.  Too bad!"
infiniti,m35,2008,Scott, 12/28/2007,A great value in this segment,4,"I looked at BMW, Audi, Lexus, and Mercedes in addition to Infiniti. The M35 with Sport pkg, Tech pkg, and advanced Tech Pkg came in near or below the ""base"" price of most of the others. The Navi system is among the more intuitive I've ever used, and the 14 spkr Bose 5.1 system is wonderful. The 19 inch wheels and Z rated tires take corners most cars would balk at without even chirping the rubber. The engine is great in most torque ranges, but could use a few more horses from a starting stop. The G37 engine has more power than even the M45's V8 - which makes no sense at all to me. I've only had the car for a month, but so far I am pleased with the purchase. It's a lot of fun to drive."
infiniti,m35,2008,JMach, 02/23/2009,Excellent Luxury/Sports Vehicle,5,"I test drove a few cars including the new 2009 TL, a 2008 E350 and a 2008 528I.  The Infiniti held its own against these three fine vehicles, both on performance and luxury comparisons.  Both the BMW and the Mercedes are excellent vehicles, but comparably equipped would have cost me $10k to $15k more.  The TL costs slightly less, but felt a little smaller and although design tastes are subjective, I liked the M's feel much better."
infiniti,m35,2008,M35MacMan, 01/08/2008,Love the M35,4,"The 2008 Infiniti is far superior to the 07 model inasmuch as the exterior has had a much needed facelift (revised front and rear fascia, grille, rear fender panels, rear deck lid and taillight design, new chrome accents and 18-inch sport wheels).  I passed on the 2007 model last year when car shopping for a friend but bought it for myself this year.  The interior is roomy and all controls are within easy reach.    The view from the cockpit is good and the hood doesn't disappear from view as with the Acura. Good all-around handling for the money led me to choosing the M35 over BMW, Acura, Lexus and Mercedes (I tested them all)."
infiniti,m35,2008,sjrcrmi, 01/18/2008,Excellent Tech plus great car,4,"I drive on highways a lot and need an easy to use tech interface and this is excellent. Easy to use, intuitive and activated through voice commands, touch screen and toggle switch. Quieter than I thought it would be and very comfortable and responsive. Great car. "
infiniti,m35,2008,Jeff, 01/24/2008,BMW Killer,4,"An absolutely great car from top to bottom. I drove EVERYTHING in this class. Nothing comes close. Yes HP is down a little, but other pluses totally outweigh that. Interior is very comfortable. Exterior is sportier than '07. Ride is exceptional."

infiniti,m35,2008,Tim, 08/28/2009,I'm in Love with my M,4,I dreamed of getting an M35 for years so you'd think I ran a great risk of being disappointed by such high expectations.  Like almost every Christmas which never lives up to my visions.  The M is better than I could have imagined.  I do wish it got better mileage but my average mpg of 22 combined is just fine for what I am getting to drive.
infiniti,m35,2008,Les, 10/09/2009,Best Luxury Sport Sedan on the Road,4,"Had for 15 months. This car is awesome. I cannot understand any complaints except for maybe gas mileage. It's what you should expect for a large sport sedan. Infiniti service and dealership was & still is excellent. In/out the door in less than an hour. Will keep this vehicle for a long time. Sporty, classy, comfortable and people love looking at it. What a deal!!"
infiniti,m35,2008,Nyarlathotep, 03/11/2008,Perfect Car,4,"It's the perfect car for me. I considered Cadillac CTS, Acura TL, Lexus ES, even the G35x, but the M35x had them beat with styling, features, and yes, value for the money. As a music lover, I can't say enough about the integrated iPod hookup/hard drive/flash drive and XM radio. I'm sure there are audiophiles out there who will complain about the Bose stereo, but believe me, it's fine. (You'll hear better & worse depending on whatever other car you're interested in.) Controls are easy to use; comfortable seats (heated/cooled); nav w/backup camera is dandy; Bluetooth/voice activation is intuitive; and, of course, it looks fantastic both inside & out! Drive it and see for yourself!"
infiniti,m35,2008,ilikecars08, 03/23/2008,Second M35 in three years,4,I traded in my 2006 M35 for a 2008 M35s after 34 months because I was very happy with the first M35 and after looking at other cars in its class believe that the current Infiniti pricing and financing deals make the choice for me.
infiniti,m35,2008,CarGuy08, 05/11/2008,Second Infiniti,4,"I traded me FX35 with sport package in for M35 with Tech/Sport. M35 drives similarly to FX35 (which was fun to drive) but a little quieter. Test drove GS/LS, A6/A8, XJ/XF and found the M to be a good mix between comfort and fun. But Lexus is a step ahead in term of technology. Interior design is what sold me on the car. A6/A8 are too confusing, GS/LS are too boring, XF is as good if not better, but less room in the back."
infiniti,m35,2008,My Second M35, 05/17/2008,My second M35,4,"I had the 2006 model, and just purchased the 2008 model with the sport package. This car is far better than any of its competitors, and comes with an abundance of standard features. The ride is sporty, yet comfortable. The interior is well appointed, and well thought out. The navigation system is by far the best and most sophisticated one out there, yet its very easy to use. You can talk to it via voice commands while driving (most competitors force you to type in directions while in park). Buy one, you wont regret it!"
infiniti,m35,2008,jim Westlake, 01/14/2009,Best car in class for value,4,Bought car in Oct '08. So far so good! I'm really impressed with the handling and manual shift combination. It's truly fun to drive. 
infiniti,m35,2008,Bruno, 03/24/2009,Love it,4,"Right after Thanksgiving my local dealer was having a big sale and I bought an 08 M35X. Drove it home in a snow storm and the all wheel drive is excellent. The command center is filled with everything you can imagine. Jukebox, Ipod integration, satellite radio, CD. Rides out great. Very luxurious interior and the 3.5 really moves when you need to. I have only put about 6k on the car so far, but love it. As soon as my wife's lease is up on her car she wants the G37x."
infiniti,m35,2008,pshawn767, 06/15/2008,Shade above the GS 350,4,Very pleased with the M. The only complaint would be fuel mileage. The M35 is lower than several others in this class. 
infiniti,m35,2008,JerrySC, 07/12/2008,Not Disappointed,4,"I find the M35 to be at the top of the list in this class.  The build quality is outstanding and the ride (non-sport) is very comfortable.  Reports have indicated that road noise at speed is more than it should be.  I think most cars with sport tires and wheels of this design will transmit a bit more noise to the cabin at speed.  It isn't enough to even be concerned with unless you are an absolute freak about total silence.  The exterior design is eye catching and the interior is by far the most impressive I have seen in any car.  The drop in Lexus reliability and the unsubstantiated excessive cost of the BMW, took those two off my list early.  A great car and a real value."
infiniti,m35,2009,autolover55, 04/13/2011,Near perfect balance between luxury and sport,4,"Consumer Reports hit the nail on the head when they rated the M35 their #1 mid-size luxury/sport car. Bought a 2009 M35 w/ Nav & Tech pkg in Feb 2010 after my 2005 Honda Accord was destroyed by a fallen tree. Owned: one year. Never a problem. Great handling, pickup, & very reliable. Guess it helps to keep up with maintenance. Radio & 6-disc CD player was adequate for me. Nav, easy to operate once I learned it. Decided to trade because of lousy fuel mileage (17-18 mpg), wanted lower pymts, & a smaller car. Bought 2005 BMW 330i sedan - very satisfied so far. If Infiniti would spend more time improving gas mileage and less time designing needless gadgets this car would fly out of dealerships. "
infiniti,m35,2009,diane springate, 04/14/2009,Exceeding My Expectations,5,"The M35 is a dream machine. I got it with the Tech and Advanced Tech packages and the vehicle has exceeded my expectations. Driving is no longer about going from point A to B. Driving is the destination. The M35 is so much fun to drive and there is so much you can do while you are driving that it is a vehicle designed for efficiency. Lane Guidance works great, the review camera with a grid makes backing up a pleasure. Recently I slammed on the brakes at the last minute and the brake assist and seat belt tensioner kicked right in making me feel safe and secure. The power of the vehicle also makes it safe - it is possible to leap out of the way of a potential collision. Great, great car."
infiniti,m35,2009,Mike M, 08/04/2009,This is a great car for the money!,4,"I really love the 2009 M35-S. My previous car was a 2007 M35 Sport as well. The car handles extremely well, can excel quickly from a dead stop, and is very sporty inside and out. Even when taking the car in for service at the dealership, they tend to give M owners a little extra attention and they go out of their way to make you feel special. All in all, I'd recommend the M35 S to anyone.   "
infiniti,m35,2009,Frank M, 08/26/2009,Outstanding Car,4,"I just traded a 2006 M45, which I loved, for this car. I got the M35 to save a few bucks and get better gas mileage.  The M35 with the 7 speed is almost as quick as the M45.  The car rides great and is fun to drive, I got the Tech and Advanced Tech with Sport Packages.  Love the DVD player, new 7 speed transmission with sport mode, hard disk music box, IPOD hook up, navigation and touch screen.  All but the DVD and navigation are new features my 2006 did not have. I got the Blue Slate with black interior and it looks great!"
infiniti,m35,2009,lanthorne, 03/18/2010,2009 Infiniti M35X,4,"I bought a used M35X from the dealer last month. It had 18,000 miles on it and was a rental car in its previous life.  I have had the car for about 1 month now. The car drives really well. The acceleration is very good. The interior is spacious and well designed. This car has the Premium Technology package and is full of cool features.  It is the top pick in the Consumer Reports evaluation for mid-size luxury cars. Reliability is next only to the Lexus LS 430 according to Consumer Reports. The only issue is with the Rear Crash ratings from IIHS which is ""Poor"" compared to an Acura RL which is rated Good on all the tests.  The Road Noise can be lower although the engine hum is enjoyable."
infiniti,m35,2009,Lee, 08/14/2009,"Rattles, rattles, rattles",3,How much do you have to pay these days for a car that does not rattle?  In the first few thousand miles I have return this car for 3 rattles. Rattles in the dash and doors are making this car a major regret.  
infiniti,m35,2009,CA Wisc, 09/01/2016,Great Car,5,"If you want a handsome, well appointed, solid car that has bullet proof reliability, this is your car.  I traded in a 2006 that I had bought for 20K (in 2009) with 30 some K miles on it for a used 2009.  The dealership gave me 10K for the 2006 in trade value on a used car price of 17K.  The trade in was 5 years later with 109K miles on the car!  In all that time on the 2006, I blew a belt and replaced brakes (other than normal maintenance).  Have had the 2009 for a year plus, no issues aside from normal maintenance, still tight, no rattles, car now has 85K on it.  Rides slightly stiffer than my old 2006, but has a bit more horses and way better sound system/tech.  I am not a big Bose fan when it comes to automobiles, but this (upgraded) sound system with Center-point is outstanding.  Are there some things that could be better?  Yes, it could have another 100 horses, ride like a limo and corner like a Corvette.   But then it would be out of my price range.  Ok, road noise could be a little better, and I wish they had put the 7 speed in the X.   Other than that, I honestly don't know why there aren't a lot more of these on the road.  Heck of a car.  UPDATE March 2017.  Still going strong, still great car.

They pushed their technology so much at the dealership we felt it had to be as good as Lexus if not better. Boy were we wrong. Unfortunately I now have 38 months of this nightmare left. I returned an 06 Lexus GS, which my phone the Palm Pre had no trouble pairing with the Bluetooth. My 09 M35X does not work at all with these phones. Static all the time and that supposedly great Bose radio that lowers and loudens itself at will comes on and off during a conversation. Then there is the nav - what a waste of money. No points of interest. Been lost a lot lately. $53000 really Infiniti. Entire system was replaced by dealer, no luck."

Although the Lexus was a little more ""cushy"" and had one or two more conveniences, this car is really the only other luxury vehicle that comes close in features, quality and value retention. The ""M"" definitely rides much better/feels glued to the road. Also has better electronics such as the navigation system which is easier to use and the sound system with the hard drive which records your CDs (very cool). I got the tech pkg, so I got the upgraded Bose system, but not the 5.1 system that comes with advanced tech pkg. Even though it is not their best, it still is far superior to the Lexus' Mark Levinson system."

The increase in power along with the 7 speed transmission makes for a great combination. The gas mileage is about the same as the 2006 at about 20mpg in mixed driving.

Purchased the Infiniti M35 because of these four advantages (ranked in order) Price (less than $39,000 with $11,000+ incentive), exterior/interior design and fit, visibility/safety, and driving comfort/performance. In first 1,000 miles of city/highway driving MPG is 24.6. Its turning circle and panic braking capability are excellent.

I've owned an Acura TL- Type S, a Lexus GS300-Sports and an Avalon Limited, Each of the cars drove me nuts with rattles and phantom noise.  Although these were fine cars, none delivered the driving experience of the M. I'm also thrilled to report that my M has been rattle free with no phantom noise.  The seats are incredibly comfortable and the lumbar support is excellent.  This was a huge factor in my purchase decision because I suffer from back and neck issues.

Would have paid another 5-10K for a similar model from MB or BMW! The interior of the car is equally as stunning as the performance. All of the functions, including the navigation, are extremely easy to use.

The vehicle has demonstrated low speed and high speed rpm increases while downs shifting. At high speeds, this is causing additional wear and tear on the drive train as evidenced by a large clanking noise. At low speeds, this is causing excess wear and tear on brakes. In both situations, it poses a safety hazard. Nissan/Infinity claims this is within the normal operating range, but the problem is significant and widespread as evidenced by Nissan/Infinity's own service people and engineers. Infinity will be forced to address this very soon or face a Toyota situation."

M35 - Much more car for the money! The interior is great and very Spacious inside, the outside is soo sleek. With perhaps one or two exceptions Infiniti has thought of everything with this car.

infiniti,m35,2010,SteveDC, 01/14/2010,2010 M35S,5,"I just bought M35S. First off that is one BEAUTIFUL car! I know looks are subjective but I love the look of this car. M35 - Much more car for the money! With perhaps one or two exceptions Infiniti has thought of everything with this car. Very spacious inside and Premium Bose, which is way better than the Harman Kardon stereo in 2010 E350 I have tested. The gas mileage it is not bad either (7spd tran+303 HP) so far 19.2 MRG combined for this level of sophistication, luxury and comfort."
infiniti,m37,2011,m37s, 07/02/2011,Audio Failure,3,"My first Infiniti M37S.
Driven 12,600 miles.
Audio started failing.
Shuts itself down every now and then.
Brought it in and received a G35 loaner. They replaced the whole system.
 Still the same problem and worse, navigation voice guide doesn't work anymore.
With new system, lost all my recorded CDs that's taken out.
So need to redo all that.
XM charges extra for changing into a different ""radio ID"" as they call it.
So have to pay out of pocket to fix it.
And still awaiting more parts for trial and error repair.
Acceleration lag gets worse after 10,000 miles, and nothing they can do about that.
Going on a roadtrip this weekend, and had to drive this without audio.
Regret buying."
infiniti,m37,2011,csrmax, 03/23/2011,Infiniti Got This M Right!-7 month update,4,"After driving my M37S over the last 7+ months, there are several ""tweaks"", in my opinion, Infiniti should make to this truly great vehicle to make it outstanding. 
Transmission needs a ""software"" update(a la BMW) I've found it more responsive in normal mode than Sport mode.
Dynamics of the Sport Package are excellent,the vehicle handles beautifully, but overall ride is too ""choppy"" for a vehicle in this price point.... get rid of the Bridgestone tires!Dunlop would be a better choice(our 2011 G37xS has them)
Vehicle should have side maker turn signals(Maxima has them!) and headlight washers
Infiniti/Nissan needs to have an""emergency"" response system..ie BMW Assist, OnStar "
infiniti,m37,2011,dieter, 12/03/2010,2011 M37x /Premium & Technology Packages,4,Outstanding performance and handling. Clear & large gauges that are well lighted day or night.User friendly electronics with a well designed touch screen interface as well as large buttons at well placed locations.I highly recommend this vehicle to seniors like myself who have difficulty with the gauges in cars like the E350 or 535i.I drove the E350 in early sun light and could not read the speedometer. The BMW uses red and orange lighting that is difficult for older eyes. 
infiniti,m37,2011,cogeezer, 03/09/2011,Give Me a Break,4,"This car has everything! It's a technological wonder. Why then can't I control some of these amazing features? For instance, I must have the doors lock when I'm driving. No override. I can't use my telephone phonebook when I'm driving. It's much safer to pull out my phone and try to read the number than to use my large screen nav system. No override. I can't use my nav system when I'm driving. Guess I'll be stopping a lot on the freeway to phone and navigate. However all my electronic safety equipment such as blind spot warning, front end collision avoidance, etc. turns off when I stop the car and I have to remember to turn it on or it won't function. So why is that safer? There is no alarm for not wearing my seatbelt. So why is that safer? Also the music box doesn't seem to be able to read most CD information so all my CD's, artists and songs are just the date and time recorded. Not too convenient. And speaking of the nav system, I've been living in my new house for three years, but my nav maps don't even show my neighborhood. I was told I could buy an update. Mighty kind of Infiniti. Speaking of nav systems, the nav system on the Infiniti sucks. It's difficult to use and technologically out of date. My old 2004 Acura TL had far superior nav capabilities and voice activation years in advance of what Infiniti has now. Infiniti touts the voice activation for the phone and nav as safer than pushing buttons. Might be if it worked! The voice activation is practically never right. Extremely frustrating. As for performance and appearance the car is spectacular in almost every way. My only complaint is that the gas mileage is horrible (15 around town and 22-23 on the highway, even using the Econ mode). My problem is I am so frustrated by all the quirky electronic annoyances every time I try to drive that I just want to take the car back."
infiniti,m37,2011,CSRMAX, 08/31/2010,Infiniti got this M right!,4,"After owning 3 BMW's over the last 7+ years,(03 M-3 Coupe, 05 545i,07 550i) I was not impressed with the 2011 new 5's design, and decided to look at Jaguar XF. AC would not work on the test drive..next! The Infiniti dealer was located near the Jaguar dealer, so I stopped and was blown away with the Malbec Black M37 S that was on the dealer's showroom floor! I was even more impressed after ""test"" driving it (dealer let me take the car for over 3 hours) I couldn't believe this vehicle was a 6 cylinder. I felt no change in power from my 550i. Needless to say, the M37S now resides in my garage! This vehicle is fantastic! I'm sure maint. costs will be less than BMW and reliability much better"
infiniti,m37,2011,Tom, 08/06/2018,2 years and no regrets,4,"A really under appreciated car that has aged very gracefully. Still looks contemporary. Good power and handling, drives like a much smaller car.  Will do anything the comparable  European sedans can do with lower cost and better reliability. Managed a 14.2 @ 98 with the shifter in drive at the local drag strip. Not as soft as the Lexus ES previously owned but still a comfortable ride. No issues or repairs needed yet, seems to be a very solidly built vehicle.

On long trips I feel comfortable that my car will slow down and speed up depending on the car in front of me.
I have had problems with the cruse control cutting off when driving into direct sunlight.
The land departure feature is wonderful as is the blind spot warning.
I never again want to drive a car without these features.
I have not experienced a problem with acceleration as described by others."
infiniti,m37,2011,SteveS, 12/05/2010,Disappointing performance,3,"Too often when I step on the gas hard, I get a long lag before the car accelerates.  When that happens, it feels like 160 hp not 330 hp.  Other times it's fine but I can't rely on adequate acceleration to move quickly onto to the highway or to pass cars.  When I slow down, the transmission jerks as it downshifts and sometimes unexpectedly actually upshifts jerking the car forward.  Infiniti service said that there was nothing they could do -- the car was designed this way."
infiniti,m37,2011,csrmax, 08/20/2011,Infiniti Got This M Right.... not really- 1 year update,3,"After a mostly positive 7month review of my M37S, now, at 1 year of ownership(mileage under 5K), my opinion has changed.When the vehicle was delivered 8/2010, all 4 rims had black stains, which the dealer could not remove, or, knew the cause(possible inproper detail chemicals) all 4 rims were replaced.July 2011, 2 rims were showing the same staining, and replaced. I began to have ABS/TRAC warning lights and a creaking in the break pedal also in 7/2011..... Master Brake Cylinder replacement!!! Rear sunshade stuck in the upright position,with motor running while driving! 3 dealer visits and still NO FIX! Contacted Infiniti Consumer Affairs.Looking for early lease termination!"
infiniti,m37,2011,mbzfan06, 01/17/2011,Fantastic,4,"Upgrade from 2009 M35 to the M37S. Better suspension and steering. Better gas milage. Typical Infiniit high quality fit,
finish, and material. Best looking 4dr sedan out there. Great software and GPS. Hook up to my cheapy Motorola cell was flawless. 16 speaker Bose above average , but my Mercedes HK is better.... but thats about all the Merc has over my Infiniti. 20 inch tires get noisy over 70mph, otherwise all is quiet. Hard to beat 330hp hooked up to a smooth 7 speed. Ahead of its class compared to Lexus, Mercedes and BMW."
infiniti,m37,2011,alfstinky, 08/23/2010,Very enjoyable driving,4,"I have to say that I love driving this car. My last car was a G35 sport coupe and I needed something with more room but I still wanted some what of a sport feel. The M37X with the ability to select the transmission shifting points gave me just that. I drive it in sport mode and it's a full size car with sport handling. Yet for winter driving in the northeast I can turn it to AWD mode and get safety I need for slippery road surfaces. The interior is very well done, better than the BMW 5 series and much better than the MB E class. The sound system that comes with the premium pkg is a pleasure to listen to. I'm extremely satisfied with this car. Gas mileage with the air on in the city is about 15"
infiniti,m37,2011,egbob, 01/06/2011,M37 trade up,4,"Traded in my 2 year old G37 for a new M37. Loved the G, but too little space. So the M should be a good compromise.

Love the car! Honestly, I don't have any of the issues I've seen in other posts, like I'm driving a different car or something. IPhone 3GS synced flawlessly,no reception issues. Copied in my address book, no issues. IPod Nano works perfectly. Excellent NAV, no issues.

Tested the Lexus IS, ES and GS. Boring. BMW 5 also, couldn't get excited. Love the room and comfort of the M. 6'5"",I need like the space, and only Nissan
built cars have the leg room. Quiet also. Not the acceleration of the G, but a good compromise of handling, size and space.People notice the car."

I was immediately sold by the interior, and feel it's as nice as my Lexus. Navigation is disappointing.  My 7 year old Honda (and portable Garmin, for that matter) has more features, and are much more user friendly.  The whole point of voice commands is to negate having to look at the screen.  HVAC should be part of the voice commands (like my Honda).  Also the climate controls must be navigated through the screen (requiring me to take my eyes off the road), and there is not a dedicated a/c button to be able to turn it off w/o having to go into the menus.  Navigation requires too many prompts to get anything accomplished. "

This car is stunning. Interior with Deluxe Touring Package in Java is great. Toys abound with Premium Package. I got mine for nothing down & $550 per month. Had G37s, so went for non sport this time. While Technology package might be nice - I would only use Distance control assist &
Intelligent Cruise Control.

For all the nay sayers, go back to your dealers. You can teach the nav via setup. I got 6 free oil changes on my car.

Exterior is very nice. Typically, rounded cars tend to look good for years, angled cars not so much - look at
VW Bug or Porsche 911"
infiniti,m37,2011,ecott, 05/22/2011,Nav/Voice recoginition system is AWFUL on the Infiniti M37,4,"The Nav/voice recognition system on my 2011 M37 is terrible.
Typical example- It asks me to name the state so I cay ""South Carolina.""
It pulls up Maine.
Try again, this time I get SC.
It asks me to name the city so I say ""Mt. Pleasant.""
It pulls up
5 choices for me to choose from ""Easley, Clemson, Greenville, Ridgeville and Camden."" REALLY????
Finally I get all the way through the state, city, and st. name but instead of asking me the street address, it turns off.
It is like trying to use a free 411 service.
If you've ever tried that you know what I'm talkng about.
I really like or even love most things about the car but the Navigation system was apparently designed by a monkey."

My navigation got me to her location no problem. But directions to go home, which is only around 7 miles, routed me over 20 miles out of my way. I am unfortunately not very familiar with the Bronx and this was quite stressful at this hour in the morning. Bad directions are routine with this vehicle. And bluetooth remains practically unusable because no one can hear me well, I'm told there is too much echo."

Of course now that I have searched online i see many people have a similar problem.
 One would think Infinity would do something about this.
I never would have bought this car if I had known this problem."

infiniti,m37,2011,PRS, 12/05/2010,First Model Year Blues,3,I bought this loaded Sports Package M37 after owning an M35 for 5 years.  The M35 was the best car I ever owned.  The M37 feels like it was rushed out by Infiniti in an attempt to get a prettier looking car on the market quickly.  Furthermore the M35 was cheaper than many of its competitors and the new model loaded comes in on the expensive side of the competition.   I've had many problems with the car already some pretty major.  Major flaws were apparent in the GPS after using it for 30 min.  I was stupefied that Infiniti put the car on the road without these kinks worked out.  Apparently I hear there's a lack of processing power needed to run the GPS properly.  I expect more from Infiniti.
infiniti,m37,2011,Randi, 11/01/2010,Don't buy,4,I am very upset with my Infiniti M if only for a couple of things. The first is that for some unknown reason Infiniti decided to police their customer's lives. You cannot enter an address in your navigation system or look for places close by unless your car is stopped regardless of whether there is a passenger in the passenger front seat. This was not required by law. It is actually more dangerous because on a number of occasions we have had to stop the car on the side of a highway or in a dangerous place along the road so we could enter data to get us to our destination. I would not recommend this car until they change this! you also cannot use many of your phone look up features. 
infiniti,m37,2011,engine101, 10/11/2011,Acceleration Problems,3,"Great car until you want to accelerate or break.
The engine seems to stall when you accelerate to pass someone or pulls back to hard when you break.
I would think the engine would be better for a $50,000 car."
infiniti,m37,2011,CH, 10/04/2016,"Love at first sight, 2 Now ok",4,"Originally I was in love with the vehicle at site. It has a nice style to the body. Very corporate looking vehicle. The cost of maintenance is low. Oil changes, and tire rotation. Re sale value is good also. The package I have has all the dings and features and that's the reason why I didn't get the S. What I don't like about the vehicle is the IBA turns on early in the morning, but only if its before 9am (lol) check engine light goes on a off due to map sensor what is getting replaced today. Bluetooth isn't the best and handling, acceleration, and oh my God! transmission Jerk is so ugly and unattractive. That's my biggest pet peev. The car literally does not know what to do. From 20-40 mph it jerks constant. I hate that with a passion. On take off it could be a lot better, and the navigation needs a serious upgrade compared to the Aldi A7 navi. Overall it's a 3.75 maybe a 4. Great vehicle for the buck and the price. People love the outer of the car and the cabinet is great as well. On long drives the seats make my back hurt. Didn't want to write a review because I don't want people to get turned off by the car. Trust me overall it is a great vehicle and Infiniti & Nissan know's has to make overall great vehicles.

The included options and comfort in the interior made this a great choice.  Car looks very sharp both inside and outside.  Incredibly smooth and quiet.

infiniti,m37,2011,jcox1944, 11/16/2012,Infiniti M37: $90 for tire rotation every 7500 miles - a bad design,4,"I recently purchased an Infiniti M37 and like the car. I was in for service today and told I have to pay $90 for tire rotation every 7,500 miles because the sensors have to be recalibrated in order for the tire gauge on dash to work. That means I would have to pay nearly $400 before I get a new set of tires. They do not tell you this when you buy a car. This is a bad design for a luxury car and undermines the marketing effort of the company to consumers. I have had 11 BMWs and nothing like that. This is nickel and diming the consumer in the service department. Bad news. If I find this with other services, I am going back to BMW. They cover your service including tire rotatio"

I started with a lease to just make sure?
Basically, I love the car, and my service writer has been great; however, I am disappointed in two things: First the Bluetooth has been a nightmare. I can hear people fine, but my callers say I sound like I'm under water, echo, they can't hear me, etc.
I first was given a software update, didn't work. Next they replaced my entire Bluetooth unit, didn't work. Lastly, they made volume adjustments, the following callers said ""call me when you're home, I can't hear you!"" Not sure I will keep the car, Bluetooth is a must!

Bose system is incredible! Handling is outstanding. The V6 rumble is very nice. I also tested the Acura R, interior way too small. Benz E has nice interior and look but handles like an old Town Car. Mushy suspension, numb steering and a pathetic V6. I did not consider the Lexus due to their current problems.

On the down side, wind and road noise is quite a bit louder than I expected, the navigation isn't great, and it's really missing some features and options available on its rivals. After buying my 2012 M37x new in August 2011, I traded it for a 2012 Audi A8 in March 2013, and I'm a much happier man.

First, the paint quality is not what I expected in a car at this price point. Our black M is covered with orange peel in the paint. From 10 feet everything looks perfect, but up close and from a angle the peel really stands out. A car in this market segment should not have this issue. Second, the shift points in the transmission don't seem to match engine RPM and torque bands when starting from a stop. This takes a little bit to get use to.

I think it's the best looking car (not just in its class), even nicer than the Jag XF which I looked at but ultimately decided against for two reasons: Too expensive & I'm sure will be unreliable through the years. I said to my wife, I couldn't imagine even a Porsche Panamera being a better car! The M with sports package is the best of both worlds, 4 door practicality for the family and a SPORTS car for me! BMW 5 series & MB E Class are just too pricey by the time you add the features we all want. Make the smart choice, go with the M! "

It will not handle Call Waiting calls like my prior M35. For someone, like myself, this is a nightmare.

Interior design, materials and craftsmanship are gorgeous and outstanding. The 6 cylinder 3.7L engine is smooth yet very responsive. Nice gain there on my old M. Handles as perfectly as the prior M did. Much quieter cabin though. Much better Bluetooth phone system, Bose audio is stellar and not much different from my 2006 M. Many new tech features are a welcome addition."
infiniti,m37,2011,dude, 08/15/2010,Love ths car!,5,This car is outstanding.  Got the m37 with sport package and premium package. Fun to drive factor is super high. Paddle shifters work great with downshift rev matching. Love the look and interior fit and finish is gorgeous.  Blue tooth phone and music streaming with my iphone 4 work flawlessly and perfect.
infiniti,m37,2011,Florida guy, 10/11/2010,iPod owners beware,4,If you are an iPod user and have current software (4.0 and higher) forget about synching it. Infiniti can't figure it out and corporate customer service just shrugs its shoulders. Pretty disappointing and pathetic. (I assume same is true with iPhones)
infiniti,m37,2011,Florida guy, 10/15/2010,Beware iPod users,4,"Many good things about this car. Comfy, fast, sensational interior, good but quirky safety technology. But, despite being touted as a technologically advanced vehicle, it cannot properly sync with the new iPod or iPhone software. Corporate customer relations says it cannot help so, in essence, you're on your own at nearly 60k!"

Only a few things that keep this car from being the best in its class.  The bluetooth is horrible! Infinit sent out a update for the system to work better with iPhone, I had it done and its still bad!! To hard to make phone calls too, why not a dial+Name. Also sound system vibrates under very little bass. I am having issues with my auto Up on my windows. They intermittently work!"

infiniti,m45,2003,Lori D. Moore, 04/05/2018,It's Like driving a Race Horse,5,"If you want to take long cross country trips and are my age (63) then take breaks so you don't get sore.  The seats are sports car seats, not plushy cushy seats.  The suspension isn't soft or cushy either but let me tell you, hang onto your hat when you give it the gas!!  You don't really need to slow down much to take a corner.  There just isn't any body roll and this car can deliver.  I grew up with the 1960's muscle cars and everything that went with it.  I am female and a great grandmother, but I do enjoy driving in a sporty manner.  Since I live in So Cal, I can drive the freeways with ""authority"".   My M45 is 15 years old now and has 137K miles on it.  Have NEVER had a repair on this car.  Just the normal maintenance stuff.  Now that it is older, there are more road noises that I hear and my CD player quit working but what would one expect at this age?   The M45 doesn't like our dirt roads much and it doesn't absorb the stutter bumps very well but it does love a mountain road and a remote road where you can loosen up the reins and let her run.  When you have it in the manual mode, it seems to lunge forward and you need to be prepared for that at a stop sign.  Alot of people think the manual mode is worthless, but they don't let it wind out enough.  Honestly, you need to have this car for a while  and really learn how to drive it.   In the years that I have had the M45, I have seen only 2 others like it.  When I have taken to get tires or an oil change, the comments you hear are ""This sure is a nice car and you don't see M's on the road""  It is a very capable car especially for its weight but that is something I like because you feel like the car is solid and ""on the road"" not ""floating above it"".    If you are looking for a strictly luxury car, then you probably won't think it's all that but if you want a combination of luxury and high performance, this is the one for you.  The instrument panel some people find confusing but all you need to do is read your owners manual and you will see how easy it really is.  There are multi-function controls so you need just to touch the component you wish to control and then look at the buttons numbered 1-6 and push the one that is appropriate.  Easy peasy lemon squeezy!!  THIS CAR IS SO MUCH FUN TO DRIVE!

infiniti,m45,2003,logan2744, 06/18/2014,NICE Car Bad Back Seat,4,"Purchased the car about 8 months ago. It had 124,000 miles on it. I was on a local government auction site and saw it. I wasn't even looking for a car. I was actually looking for something else not car related. It had issues. Needed paint, starter, driver seat and some tlc. I checked for recalls and found that it had 2 recalls that needed to be done. Infiniti fixed them. While at the Infiniti Shop they saw that the gas gauge wasn't working properly. That was a $1000.00+ to repair. So after getting it painted, a new driver seat, starter and putting some tlc in it at an additional cost of $1000.00+ I finally think I have a great running car. Car has some get up to it. "
infiniti,m45,2003,Tarek Wally, 06/30/2018,"The Original M45, a thinking man's perf. car",5,"In my opinion the styling is timeless, has aged well, and is very distinctive.  I always have people coming up to me asking what it is, particularly in the captivating Red Garnet Fire paint.  The acceleration is amazing, even more so at freeway speeds when you put the pedal down, the 5 speed auto downshifts to third and in no time you're at triple digit speeds, all the while the 4 cam V8 sounds exhilarating and happily loves to rev.  Thankfully the 4 wheel discs slow with authority.  In winter or slick conditions it's smart to be gentle on the throttle and I had no worries when winter tires are swapped in. Having never been stuck in Minnesota winters is a tribute to the predictable nature of the chassis and good driving skills. The biggest drawback is fuel economy, followed by rear seat leg room.  The only seat you need to care about is the driver seat.  It's a big shame these are such rare cars.

We're still enjoying the power, but the transmission isn't very responsive and the manual mode is worthless.  The seats are comfortable and have nice amenities, but the driver's seat squeaks now.  We still love all the gadgets, but they are difficult to use.  We've encountered more issues, but we do have 108K miles now.  The exhaust manifold was changed under warranty.  Now it's cracked again - poorly engineered.  We still burn a quart every 1,000 miles (108 quarts so far!)  Tire wear is phenomenal.  The originals ran 28K miles.  The second set were Essenzia and were just changed.  The new Hankook Ventas don't feel very good on the car."

a nice touch.  The tiptronic 5 speed

The car gets loads of attention and compliments, my mechanic always compliments the powerful v8 and many get surprised when they find out the car has 340 horses under the hood. 

Ive had a few issues with the car, like the fuel gauge inaccuracy which has left me stranded a few times on the road. My camshaft position sensor failed me at around 75k miles. My only complaint is parts are scarce and everything must be special ordered from infiniti. Other than parts issues, recalls, and general maintenance this car is flawless.<br><br><br><br>

Feels great up to 120 mph - feels unsafe at 125 mph.  Big car - Interior feels narrow.  I like the handling and performance of my car, but it does not have give you feedback like my BMW 540i.  This car is a sleeper.  You can pull away from nearly every car on the road.  Stereo system is very nice.  Ours is black with tinted windows and chrome wheels - I think the best color for this car.

We have owned one now for about 4 years and up til recently have been some what satisfied. It has about 80K on it and everything is falling apart. Like previous poster gas guage is unreliable and it has been in the shop waiting for a part for over a week now. The whole instrument cluster has to be replaced!! A big rig has a tighter turning radius. Interior lights have been replaced a few times too and rarely work correctly. Infinities are not built to last.

After 5 years, it still turns heads at the styling.  Odd and unique....which is why I love it.  Not a lot of them on the road.  The power is second to none in its class, the features are top of the line for a 2003 model and it handles better than any BMW, Mercedes, Lexus I've had the pleasure of driving.  So many reviews complain of gas mileage.....what do you expect in a V8 performance car???  It's not a Hybrid!"
infiniti,m45,2003,TJ, 07/21/2009,M for Muscle 4.5 V8,4,I bought a used 2003 M45 in 2006 with 28000 miles on it. It is black with brushed aluminum wheels. It also has hand painted silver and gray pinstripe along the length of the vehicle. This picks up the chrome and the wheels nicely. This car is a beast on the road. I have complete confidence in the capabilities when highway driving. The car is very stable. Stays flat on the road. No pitch or yaw issues for a car of this size. There is more than enough power to get you in/out of trouble ;)... The V8 is smooth and responsive. It responds with a growl during acceleration at any rpms. There is no equal for the money. What a value!

Our M45 has a very unique look, which I've come to like.  The interior is still very nice.  Our car still drives very well - it doesn't feel like 108K mi.  The power is very impressive.  The aluminum suspension components cut unsprung weight.  A lot of things have broken, which is upsetting. Infiniti service writers are nice, but they will not fight for the customer.  Our air bag light has been on since a hair over 50K mi.  The warranty is good up to 7yr/70K, but they wouldn't fix it.  The oil issue stinks.  Due to the bad service, I won't buy again."

I'm just glad I never bought it new. The quality is below luxury in my book. I also have a Lexus the quality of the material and finish is top notch. The Infiniti not so much trunk struts don't work, center arm rest is cheap and feels loose, sunroof liner coming apart, fuel guage not reading correctly (recalled ), engine doesn't start up on first try sometimes, and airbag light is on.

It has always been service by Infiniti wihtin the manufacturer specs. When I picked up the car, the front rotors were warped...they cut them. This problem has persisted over the past three years and they simply cut the rotors.  Secondly, the car burns over 1 quart of oil per 1000 miles.  As everyone else has experienced, Infiniti denies there is a problem, states that burning 1 quart per 1000 miles is normal.  If you persist, they will then go through the ""consumption test"" and will try everything they can EXCEPT FIX THE PROBLEM.

both of them away.  When I got into my 
E320 after two long days of driving the 
M45, the Mercedes seemed frumpy and 
outdated - and that's a car I love.  
The Mercedes handles better and burns 
less gas.  Other than that, there is no

in every other category."

dealership, it was an easy choice. The 
dealership not only treated us more 
professionally, but had a superior 
product with a much better price tag. 
Loved driving this car its lots of 
fun. Ran a G-tech on the car and it 
ran 0-60 in 6 seconds and a quarter 
mile in 14.2 not bad for a four door 
sedan. If you are looking dont miss a 
test drive of this car. So far the 
only downside I noticed was that the 
controls on the side of the seat are 
not real easy to reach, however once 
the seats are set the memory seats are 
easy to reach."

Almost everyone that sees my car loves 
it (Graphite on Graphite with

experienced a problem with the tire

reason for this is that the fuel tank is

obvious.

The body is not what I would call a
leading edge design.

fits, the doors close well. Fit and

But with the deal has come some real reliability issues including new tires (Michelin Pilots) due to lot rot, new battery and a new fuel pump (all replaced under warranty). I've had this car towed in twice in 6 weeks!  I worked for GM for 4 years and am begining to wonder if I bought a Buick!  Dealer has made necessary repairs but has done little to build my loyalty.

hesitates two to three seconds when 
sudden acceleration is required such as 
for merging lanes in freeway traffic.
The cruise-control ""collision 
avoidance"" feature tends to cause rear-
end collisions because it causes the 
vehicle to suddenly decellerate when it 
tries to pass a truck-trailer rig on an
adjacent freeway lane, especially on an 
inside curve.
There is a severe blind spot at the 
left and right windshield post and 
adjacent car door (where the rear-view 
mirrors are mounted) for people of 
short stature like myself, a problem 
for close manuvering."

If it dies the dealer is either to fix it or lower the price. Nissan speaks for itself. It even has a low rumble RRRR. The tires are 18/low profile so expect to pay more. People shouldn't compare this to a sports car because it's on the same lines as a GS.  I owned a 97 Camaro SS.  Fast but it's a luxury sport.  Classy car. People will tell you I have heard of a M but never actually seen one.  Very smooth design. "

is, except for expensive). The car 
really hauls. I totally dusted an Audi

The BMW was more sporty, felt the road more, 
yes. all that's true. But given all those people 
in their automatic 325 sedans, I think 
that argument is hooey. The M 
drives really well and knocks you back in your

and fit-finish are excellent, gadgets fun. 
 Finally, the M has taken its knocks for its

I took a BMW 530 to task with no problem.  No one knows what this ""sleeper"" can do.  Most don't even know what the M45 is.  At 70 MPH this car is asking you to please let it go faster.  At 100 MPH its asking to please open it up all the way.  During that time it feels and handles like a German car and the stereo is going, so pay attention to your driving.  If you can't handle or appreciate very fast cars, go get a something else.  This one is a dark horse among many wannabes.  At today's prices its a steal.  They won't be so low for long."

it could comfortably double recommended 
highway exit ramp speeds w/o noticeable 
oversteer or tire complaint.  The 
silent V8 had real thrust to adjust 
high-speed handling and accelerate from 
100+ mph.  As the owner of an '01 M

fun and off beat.  (And probably

The various car magazine comparisons all rated the Infiniti M45 top of the class in 2006 and 2007.  I found this car listed on a Jalopnik review for top used luxury car bargains and boy were they on top of it.  The 4.5 V-8 is incredibly smooth and powerful.  The best feature of all is that the car drives and handles amazingly!  In addition, basic maintenance items like brakes, wheel bearing hubs and other little issues on a 9 year old car are super easy to fix and parts are very affordable.  Many parts have an identical low-priced Nissan part number if you do a little research or lurking around on nicoclub.com  I also drive this car year-round and with Michelin X-ice tires it is remarkably sure-footed in the snow and ice.  If you've been driving around in a Camry or Accord or Fusion or other plain old 4 door sedan, do yourself a favor and consider what I did.  I sold my 2013 Accord through Craigslist and picked up the 2006 Infiniti M45 Sport and had $5,000 left in my pocket.

The interior is good but could use better front seat with multi adjustment seat of other cars in the same class. It only offers your basic functions.

infiniti,m45,2006,Ronald Crowley, 04/10/2017,Luxury with a rocket ride,4,"Lots of power.  Needed to replace an amplifier at 100K.  Cost $700.  Bose System is better than my top of the line Sony Home Stereo system.  Seats are very firm .  I now have 207K on the car and still rides beautifully.  Got caught up in the passenger air bag replacement and took 6 months to get the parts to get it replaced.  Replaced wheel bearings on passenger side at 150K.  That cost $500.  So when things break, it isn't a cheap fix.  Good thing is rarely does that occur.  I'm 6'5"" and weigh 300lbs. fit fine.  Driver seat is still firm after 7 years of daily driving.

It is packed with luxury options to make it a true luxury car, while the 335hp V8 with firm suspension makes the car a true performer. It is not a sports car for sure, which it should not be, as it is a luxury sedan.  This car makes the trip enjoyable no matter drive it fast or slow."
infiniti,m45,2006,SteveB, 05/21/2006,Great car--low gas mileage,4,"The Infiniti M45 handles like a sports car.  It has cutting edge electronics-- the best navigation system available, laser cruise control, keyless ignition, rear camera, an audible warning if you get too close to the white line. Based on my experience, reliability is excellent.  The only negative: 15-16 mpg.  Since I drive about 8000 miles a year, the low milage doesn't cost me very much.  To me, it's worth it to have such a high performing, comfortable and technologically advanced car."
infiniti,m45,2006,Bobby, 01/25/2007,Great Sport Sedan!!!,4,"The 2006 M-45 Sport is a great sport sedan and I think it is the best value of all the good sedans out there. If you compare it to its real peer group, BMW 545/550,MB E500/550,AUDI S-6, it is as fast or faster, handles and brakes better, has more user features in the interior, and is less expensive! My car is loaded with Voice-activated Navigation ,Bluetooth , heated and cooled seats,DVD,6-disc CD changer, leather, 19 in. brushed aluminum sport wheels, etc. It is the best driver's sport sedan I have ever owned. The acceleration is very quick (0-60 in 5.2 sec.), the brakes are phenomenal, and the handling is very flat around fast corners."

I have never driven a sedan that handles this well. I like to drive aggressively on mountain roads and the M is willing partner. Passengers are blown away by the technology, GPS, bluetooth, self adjusting cruise, lane departure warning I could go on and on. I have yet to have any problems with the car, just oil change. Did I mention the Bose 14 speaker sound! This car is tight! 12 hour drives are piece of cake!"

The initial test drive with M35 wasn't quite satisfying, so I decided to test out the M45. The V8 on the 45 version has a great compromise on the bulkiness of the sedan. The car takes off like a rocket. The thrill on speed is just one of the best features, the stability is probably the second biggest accomplishment for this car. Body roll is minimal when serving through the lanes in high speed on the freeway. The manual shifting is precise and quick. The only recommendation I have for this car is a six-speed auto gear box insteaf of five and a small lift on the rear facia."
infiniti,m45,2006,Linda, 09/10/2007,Terrific Performance Sedan,4,"I love this car!  I have owned it for 2 years and have no complaints.  I owned a Corvette before this car and wasn't sure how I would adjust to driving a sedan but this one has it all.  It performs well, the power is there, the transmission is very smooth and it handles corners beautifully. The interior is very comfortable and visually appealing.  It has a sexy exterior (I added the rear spoiler). The technology is easy to use (although the voice activation takes some getting used to).  The stereo is amazing and having XM radio is great.  I have the Dolby surround sound and it is like sitting  in a concert hall!  Having the Bluetooth is handy.  Keyless ignition and entrance is a great touch."

Love the 3D GPS, voice activated controls, rear backup camera, A/C control seats (could be better), and overall looks.  But from the very first oil change, have noticed using oil; not leaking, not smoking, but I have added from 1 to 2 quarts between changes.  Also, moonroof leaks in any car wash, have had to have the AC serviced each year.  Heated and cooled seats do not compare to the BMW. Ride is noisy, low-profile tires look great, but makes bumpy ride.  If battery dies, no way to open the trunk (for jumper cables)."

Build quality appears good and there is plentiful space in the cabin. Very poor pdi. Glue all over the car and the rear deck spoiler was warped on delivery. It was replaced after the second trip with another warped part(?). Has to go back again. Performance is acceptable for a 4000 lb. Vehicle, but not great- it's no m5.Fit and finish excellent.

The Infiniti M45 is by far the closest feel to the german's you can get in a japanese sports sedan.  Great reliability, great styling, and many features.  Problem with the car is the horrible gas mileage averaging 13.5 MPG in the city and that's 3.4 MPG less than my BMW 540.  Tons of features but they are all low grade.  For example..the seat heaters don't even compare to the BMWs, the sound system is very hollow and tin sounding (plastic like), shared dashboard gauges from the Altima, and last...the suspension is horribly rough on everyone in the car."
infiniti,m45,2006,HAL, 01/06/2006,Big mistake,2,"After owning from Porsches (11) to Bmw's (4) and various American cars spanning over 45 years, this rates as one of the most overrated and troublesome vehicles I have owned. What makes it worse has been no factory support for these problems, which have been mostly electronics that control safety function such as ABS,Traction Control,Etc.The selling dealer service manager did everything he could to solve the problems, even improvising on his own but was limited by the factory representatives. Back to German cars, forever!"

This is far and away the best all around car I have ever driven in this class.  I test drove BMW 5 series, Audi A6, and Lexus GS430 before I purchased the M and in my opinion the M blows them away. The rear active steering (RAS) makes a subtle but noticeable difference in turning and cornering.  The intelligent cruise control absolutely spoils you for long commutes!  Why not drive the M45?  Well, if you drive the M35 first (6 cyl,280 HP) , you'll love it.  But if you then drive the M45 (8 cyl 335 HP) you'll never go back and it will cost you $7,000 more!"

It handles like a 2door sports-coupe and roomy enough for 5.  This car out-runs most sports-cars!!!!  Life's too short, so buy one now!!!! My lexus gs400 seats , fits me somewhat better but the M45's seats, has more lateral support.  They should put Michelin a/s Pilot sports on this car.

Not to much difference really in suspension from what I'd seen during test drive. But you can't get the heated and reclining seats in the M45 Sport. For the money the performance, design, and technology are the best out of BMW, Audi, Acura, and Lexus. If you want a performing luxury sedan go with the Infiniti M. Its nice to be able to take a 530i BMW at the stop light and win!!! And as for the lexus GS430, you can leave them in your dust Too. INFINITI, It seems Ive become a definite part of the Family.

It's sleek, stylish, and the interior leaves nothing to be desired. It's fun to drive, and as I live in the mountains, it handles curves and hills like a dream.

Number one would be the engine and drive train.  Best feel of power and control I have ever experienced including BMW540i.  It is both design and crafted with excellence and thought.  The technology is very good but not quite up to the Acura RL, but I would take the drive train and vehicle design over the technology difference.  The features are very extensive and user friendly.  One can practically live in the car enjoying all the features and technology.  It handles very well at all speeds and conditions as all the reviews showed.  I have not been disappointed."

It has trememdous power, yet it is smooth as can be.  It handles and corners quite well, in fact we drove the M45 sport version, and find little difference in how the regular version handles.  Although the M45 appears to be smaller than a Q45 on the outside, inside it is just as large, with a much larger trunk.  We cannot imagine a better luxury vehicle for the money!"

I'm glad I got the M45, I think the M45 is the best value out there.  It's has more power then the Lexus 430 (previously owned). It's a nice car and a great value. "

You must take your foot off the accelerator and reapply slowly, Same with the manual mode. Can be dangerus when changing lanes in heavy traffic. To dealer 3 timers, they say they can not replicate this and it is fine. It is not fine,  did this from day one. Some one said a software problem may exist as it is 1st generation software.

A full year into the ownership experience I still look forward to getting behind the wheel.  The acceleration and torque remind me of the muscle cars I knew from the 60s.  I've owned 2 of the last generation BMW 5 series. The M45 competes with them in performance, but beats BMW 5s in room, comfort, and technology.

With the Acura everything is standard, but there are no options to get.  This thing I have has the DVD player in the roof and on the dash.  With rear wheel drive you have no need for SH-AWD.

It replaces a G35 coupe and the difference in fit, finish and quality is amazing.  I had two G35's and always was disappointed by the cheap and often squeaky interior.  The M45 is a world apart in terms of materials and and the feel of quality.  If anything, the car is faster too.  There is no substitute for pure V8 power and torque!  The list of technology and features on the car is a huge leap also.  Especially if you love the gadgets like I do.  I compared the Lexus GS and Acura RL and found the M45 to be the best choice for me.  It is more of a SPORTS luxury car, but has all the features of the other two if not more."
infiniti,m45,2006,calsteamer, 05/11/2005,Best all-around performance sedan,4,"I have spent the past 6 months trying to decide on new car.  I tested all comparable cars (BMW 545, Lexus GS430, Mercedes E500, Cadillac STS), and this was by far the best car for the money.  Finnaly, a car with Japanese reliability that drives like a german car.  "
infiniti,m45,2006,Todd Bessemer, 05/20/2005,Todds M45,5,"Great car. As good as my BMW that I traded. Only had it for 3 weeks but I cannot find a single solitary problem. Fast, Great fun to drive, gets looks and waves and beeps. Love it. Kids  love the DVD player. We do too. No backseat whining from the little ones."
infiniti,m45,2006,Leejack, 05/23/2005,Wow!,4,All I can say is wow! The the powerfull V8 is as smooth as butter and the transmission seems like it can read my mind. Performance like this along with all the bells and whistles you could ask for make this a great vehicle. 
infiniti,m45,2006,MARK, 05/24/2005,awesome vehicle,5,"I had a 2004 TL which I really liked.  But, last weekend I test drove an M45 for fun and was immediately hooked on this vehicle.  I traded in my TL and took over a demo with 8,000 km's on it.  This vehicle is a true sports luxury vehicle.  The power, handling and technology is out of this world.  Even the geartronic is by far superior to my TL.  The DVD audio system in my TL was the best I have ever heard until now.  "
infiniti,m45,2006,Brad King, 05/24/2005,Everything you could want and more!,4,"I tested all the competitors(Lexus, Acura, Mercedes, and BMW). The M gives you the most bang for your buck. I've got the technology package and it is unreal. No other car has all of the features this came with. Bluetooth connectivity for the cell phone works great. The DVD surround sound is incredible. I suggest the Santana Supernatural DVD for testing this sound system. The backup camera is very helpful for parallel parking. The laser guided crusie control is great. You can watch DVD videos on the front screen if you are in park. This is great for when the wife is shopping and you want to kick back in the car. The power in the M45 is fantastic. You could not ask for more.  ENJOY!! "
infiniti,m45,2006,sdcal, 06/06/2005,First car I ever loved...,4,"I have almost 3000 miles on my M45 Sport and have enjoyed every single one of them.  Even those when I was stuck in S CA traffic.  The car is very fast, very fun, and very comfortable.  I do not understand those that compare the car to a maxima or G series Infiniti.  There's no comparison."
infiniti,m45,2006,Dr. E. Brown, 06/08/2005,The New Benchmark,5,"The Infiniti-M series is the new benchmark in this class without a doubt.  It takes all of the good qualites of the Lexus GS and BMW 5- Series and combines them into one complete package.  The car is quick and handles well, and it feels like a real luxury car.  The interior is beautifully finished and the exterior is very nice looking.  This car has almost every feature someone could possibly want.  Infiniti has hit a grand-slam with this car."
infiniti,m45,2006,Paul Rogers, 06/20/2005,"Great value, still not quite first tier",4,"I have come to the M45 after 12 years of owning much higher-end luxry performance cars: Mercedes SL55, Jaguar XJR, Acura NSX.  The M45 won me over with the only interior design comparable to the first-tier cars, and very reasonable performance for a 4 door sedan. Exterior design is uninspiring, sharing far too much with the Nissan Altima and Maxima.    Highs: interior design, wheels, ride comfort, seating room, performance capability, value.  Mediums: steering response, exterior styling, exterior fit and finish, paint quality, audio  Lows: interior fit and finish (relative to class); buggy XM radio implementation; rear shade is $5000 option (because it is bundled with rear video screen)  "

infiniti,m45,2006,Dale Fredrick, 07/14/2005,M45 Sport - The True Positive & Negative,3,"Positives: 335 HP V-8 engine is superior to all others, very smooth & powerful. Seats are very comfortable for long drives,ventilated,lumbar. Voice commands,Bluetooth,NAV,Bose Studio 14 spkr DVD audio & technology features superior. Reliable electronics (Japan),100% Japan parts content & assembly. Awesome tech & features for price point. Negatives: Headliner ""clicks"",intermittent rattles,road feel & handling feedback compared to new BMW 5 Series is poor,wheel balance on front right was way off. Quirky steering wheel movement on freeways requires continuous tiny hand inputs probably due to 19"" tires and sport suspension setup(too tight)After 3000 mi.& 3 months sold car to CARMAX for $48,000."
infiniti,m45,2006,Rob Conley, 08/02/2005,Very Refined Hot Rod,5,"After driving many competitors, selected the M45. What a wonderful car. Very luxurious and spacious for four people. The interior is very well done, liked (and got) the wood accents. This is the best handling  and quickest sedan I have ever driven. The manual-shifting automatic works MUCH better than others I've tried. The shifts are very smooth, and it feels like it is meant to be used. I use it 90% of the time. The engine is just great, capable of quick acceleration from any speed. The navigation system has a learning curve, but is very useful and the voice feature actually works! Also like that the computer system supplements, but doesn't replace the audio and climate buttons."
infiniti,m45,2006,?, 08/19/2005,Un diplomatic fun!,5,"I have driven an X5, XK8 coupe, Range Rover and a S Type in the past 2 years. I have been HAMPERED with problems with the RR and the XK8 and finally decided to try somthing more reliable upon a freinds recommendation to try the M series.  I literally left 5 minutes before signing the for an Audi 6 and thought I'd at the very least try this car.  I did, I bought it and it's really a tremendous car.  Did I just jinx myself?  Anyway, to date love it.  The air conditioned seats!  What a treat.  I'm 35 years old and it's the perfect sporty sedan for me.   Chris J. Meza"
infiniti,m45,2006,Preston Ingalls, 09/05/2005,What a car!!!,5,"I love this car.  I traded my 2003 G35 in for it which I loved but this is such an upgrade.  The comfort on the road, the awesome Bose sound system, the handling and the speed for passing leaves one breathless. After looking at Beamers and Lexus, why would you buy one of those when you can have this???  I can see why Car and Driver mag selected it as the best in its 8-car class for luxury cars."
infiniti,m45,2006,mbeirwagen, 10/19/2005,I love this car!,5,"I have been driving luxury vehicles since 1995 and I am absolutely blown away with my M45.  Once I understood how to run the controls which are a little intimidating, I have been on the ride of my life....Watch out for cops.  The interior is finally luxury for an Infiniti. This is my 5th Infiniti and the others ones had a very plastic interior.  Not this one! So much better than the GS 430. You really must treat yourself!"
infiniti,m45,2006,Burn-It, 12/02/2005,Awesome Ride,4,"I love it when BMW 5 series owners start messing with me - after I toy with them a little while, they are just a spec in my rearview mirror before they knew what hit them. The M45 Sport Tech is awesome, has incredible torque through all ranges. I compared this against the Lexus GS430, AudiA6, MercedesS430 & BMW545. The M45 Sport has all of the strongest features of each of those 4 wrapped into 1 incredible luxury rocket ship! Very roomy interior and trunk. Although Lexus has a few more electronic gadgets, I like the M45 navigation and heads-up controls better.  The interior rocks, not a bunch of plastic like Lexus and not cold like the German makes. No wonder all the mags rated M the best."
infiniti,m45,2006,jrh332, 12/06/2005,The Beast Within,4,Had my choices narrowed down to Audi A6 S line or the M45 Sport.  Infiniti won hands down and didn't hurt being roughly $8000 cheaper with about the same equipment level.  I know it doesn't have all the Audi features but the Audi doesn't have all the M45's equipment either.  Truely a drivers car.  The performance out of this 4000 lbs car is something you have to experience.  Performance tires may pick up some noise depending on pavement otherwise as quiet as sitting in your living room. Controlled ride and appears to be screwed together pretty good.  
infiniti,m45,2006,RobB, 03/03/2006,My M45,4,"This M45 replaced a 2002 BMW7series. It was $30K less with most of the features and higher quaility. The V8 is as responsive and the trunk will handle 4 golf bags. The electronics function better than the 7 series and the gps screen is the best I have used. The only down side is this car is not a car for the winter season in Michigan (go for the M35 all wheel drive) We spend our winters in Fla. so its ideal.  To sum up , this car is like driving a sports car with room for a foursome."
infiniti,m45,2006,sambar6, 03/18/2006,Pleased with my M45 with Premium Package,4,"This car absolutely rocks.  The V-8 has ""push you back n your seat"" torque throughout the power band.  The transmission is smooth is regular driving and responsive in spirited driving.  Considered Acura RL, Caddy STS and Audi A6.  This car blew them all away."
infiniti,m45,2006,KillerM45, 03/22/2006,I luv my M45,4,I've only had my car for 5 days but I can say that this is by far the the best vehicle I have ever owned.  The luxury of the care is second to none.  All the options ( I own the premium edition).  I would most definitely recommend this car to anyone who is looking is catagory of car.
infiniti,m45,2006,JEFF, 04/01/2006,fantastic car,4,"This car is really fun to drive; terrific acceleration on the freeway. As a former Lexus owner, the road feel of the M45 is a welcome change from riding in a cocoon. The dash console is attractive but a little confusing. Sirius satellite radio is a big plus."

infiniti,m45,2006,M45, 07/29/2006,The Dream Car,5,"If you ever wanted a car that could do everything, the M45 is the car for you. It comes with every accessory known to man. It's one of those cars that you enjoy getting into every day to go to work or go on an outing. No matter where you go, people will be looking and admiring what you are driving. I have owned in my life time at least 12 vehicles from different makers and I can honestly say, I have found a home with the Infiniti M45."
infiniti,m45,2006,he knows, 09/17/2006,the facts and nothing but...,4,"An exemplary combination of fit, finish, power, convenience, reliability, power, comfort and all other characteristics one would expect of a vehicle of this class and price."
infiniti,m45,2006,Mitsman, 09/24/2006,Sport M45 Surround Sound,4,"If you like music, you have to get the Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound w/ DVD Set Up. The absolute highest fidelity Sound EVER experianced. You will need quality Live Music Videos and be sure to choose the Dobly 5.1 ""Audio Option"" on the DVD. Absolutely unbeleivable.  And obviously, this car is extremely nice in every area I could write about."
infiniti,m45,2006,Kent, 12/20/2006,Love it,4,"I originally was going to buy the GS 350, but after driving it several times, I felt cramped and I couldnt even sit in the back seat with out slouching over.    Once I drove the M45, it has plenty of room and power (more than the GS430) and costs less.   It's a very civilized hot rod!  Love it!"
infiniti,m45,2006,DJ, 06/19/2007,Great choice in this segment,4,"Purchased used w/4,000 miles, all options except DVD screen and heated rear seats.  Great performance and handling for such a large car.  Tested Lexus GS 430 and BMW 530 but M45 seemed much roomier in the back and quicker as well.  Love the soft leather and rosewood, even though Lexus still more refined inside.  Exterior styling also a little bland compared to E500 and GS 430.  Nice exhaust rumble that's not intrusive when cruising at highway speeds.  Glad I don't have sports suspension, supple ride that's only occasionally harsh over very large irregularities (especially if accelerating hard).  Rides a bit noisier than Lexus, but expected given sporty personality."
infiniti,m45,2007,Wendell, 11/06/2006,Outstanding to Own!!,4,"Leased this car about 3 weeks ago. Have been following this model since the redesign in 2006. When my 2003 Volvo S80 lease was about to end, I saw an special on the website. I went in to the local dealer and they were able to set me up. although I went in to get an M35, I ended up deciding on the M45 Sport. The 8 cylinder is only 1 mile per gallon different in the MPG. The power of the 4.5L is quiet but very muscular. The interior comforts are great and the overall appearance of the car bring many compliments. Got a 21 month lease on the car at about $100.00 per month more than I was paying for my S80. love driving this machine...."
infiniti,m45,2007,desertfox, 10/21/2009,M45 Sport,4,"Purchased this car used w/27,000 miles on it. CPO Infiniti. I'm a Lexus guy and still own one but this car really opened my eyes. The ride quality is great, no issues with sport suspension. Interior is quiet as any luxury car I have ever driven. This car takes no backseat to any German luxo sedan out there."
infiniti,m45,2007,mike8231985, 04/20/2012,Best car I've ever owned,5,"I had a Mercedes E-class prior to this and was ready for something more sporty. I'm in my 20s, and I think the E-Class is geared towards older people who just want comfort. The M45 is for people who like to drive hard and get thrills from speed and performance. I never thought a sedan would be as much fun/more fun as my BMW 330ci. Reliability is amazing and part of the reason I decided against buying another German car. The Infiniti fits my personality a lot better than the stuffy E-class."
infiniti,m45,2007,CTB, 10/20/2006,Excellent Car,4,"Outstanding sport car in a sedan body; great vehicle for those that like a blend of luxury, quality and speed"
infiniti,m45,2007,mboy, 10/24/2006,1a,4,After 3500 miles the M45 has been a pure joy to drive. The rear view camera works very well as does the adaptive speed control. The lane departure function can be annoying on streets that have uneven surfaces or are a bit rough as these surfaces are picked up as lines and false readings are frequent. I am about to turn this feature off. Acceleration is more than adequate and handling is superb. Fuel consumption is a bit disappointing at only 16 mpg combined. Overall a great car. 
infiniti,m45,2007,Rando, 09/15/2006,Goes like a bat outta hell !,4,"Car is fast !  Handles extremly well in sweeping curves exiting off the highways, no one can keep up least of all those tail-gating SUVs, LOL !  Downshifts are awesomely quiet.  "
infiniti,m45,2007,freshpavement, 03/20/2007,"Great car, very fast + lots of fun",4,"After test driving almost every model made by BMW, Mercedes, Audi & Lexus, I was surprised that the Infiniti M45 was the most comfortable, fun to drive and intelligently designed of the bunch. I wanted a 4-door sedan, so during the test drive I put my 6'3"" son in the back seat and he had plenty of leg & headroom (not the case with the BMW 5 or 7 series, nor the Mercedes E or S Series).  The electronic systems are easy to use - I pretty much had it down after the first drive.  It's a really fast car - in fact, I've had to talk my way out of two speeding tickets in the year I've owned it.  No problems whatsoever, great sound system (I got the sport model with the nav/tech package)."
infiniti,m45,2007,Lars, 06/03/2007,Extremely Recommended,4,"I test drove Volvo, Saturn, BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Lexus. None of these other cars are so much fun to drive with such great technology features as the Infiniti. My M45 is fast, easy to drive, comfortable with more leg and head space than Audi, BMW or Mercedes has. What a smooth ride."

infiniti,m45,2007,MMM45, 12/30/2008,Luxury at a Lower Cost,4,"I opted out from buying the Sport model due to it being for my wife and the harsher ride. I purchased a used 2007 M45 with 18K. It has the Tech pkg & the Advanced Tech pkg. It may have the 18"" wheels, but they are chrome and this car has the ground effect pkg including the spoiler like the Sport model. You cant beat the Graphite Metallic exterior and the black interior color combo! It handles great and has lots of power, though for a V8, I think there is a lot of it capped somewhere in the programming. This car is loaded with features! It has everything except the power rear seat controls. The steering, braking, balance, and power combo is superb!  "
infiniti,m45,2007,MMM45, 12/30/2008,Additional Comments,4,I forgot to add that I love the 14 speaker Bose system in this car! 5.1 surround sound is just unheard of in a vehicle until now! Wonderful! The 6-in-dash CD changer and DVD in the center console is great as well! This car is like a mobile home audio entertainment system almost.   The heated and cooled front seats are great too!
infiniti,m45,2007,Kris Shanahan, 09/19/2006,Amazing Ride,5,"This car continues to blow my mind.  It is by far the best car I have ever driven.  I trade in every 2-3 years, but it is going to be hard to give this car up."

infiniti,m45,2007,KS, 04/16/2007,Great performance and fun driving,4,"Just leased 2007 sport model with techno package and aerodynamic kit black on black and must say it is one hell of a car. I have been looking for a while and narrowed my choices down to BMW 530i sport and Infiniti M45, I was leaning more towards Infiniti although it was more expensive than BMW but I was able to get a great deal and all the options I was looking for. This car feels expensive and it is a blast to drive! The engine is so smooth and the exhaust growl makes me want to floor it every time. Even when I pull up to Mercedes S class or BMW 7 series they can't help but stare at my Infiniti and then I leave them in my dust."
infiniti,m45,2007,Mak, 08/05/2007,Best Car in Class,5,"I bought the M45 sport 2 months ago and can't be happier with the choice I made. This car handles and drives better than the competing 5 series models I drove and leaves most luxury sedans in the dust. It wasn't the value that drove me to buy this car (it is way cheaper than the beamer) but the overall package.  Even the much more expensive BMW 550 doesn't deliver the luxury this car delivers, and I prefer the interior of this car. The back seat passengers have more leg-room and can actually adjust their seats. This is the first time my two kids have stopped fighting over the front seat. The younger one actually prefers the back. Overall, could't be happier. Love, love the car."
infiniti,m45,2007,andy, 05/24/2007,Great car,4,"I've driven BMWs 12 out of the last 20 years. Went to look and prices were out of site. Drove 530, E350/550, GS 450h, Audi A6 then the M45. Drove out loaded advanced tech package, spoiler and rosewood. Car is a dream. Has every luxury item that the Germans nickle and dime you with. Very smooth but powerful acceleration. Quiet comfy interior, great stereo and nav, ac seats are great in florida."
infiniti,m45,2007,Kevin, 06/17/2007,Love this car,5,I've had the M45 for 2 months. I've driven it almost 4500 miles and I love the car. Haven't had even one small problem. 
infiniti,m45,2007,pep, 06/14/2007,Problem with headlights,4,"Everything that you have read about this car is true (it's great),  it's hard to believe anyone being disappointed with the M45 Sport.  However if you drive this car on the highway at night, you need to know that the design of the headlights is faulty.  The high beams are focused so high that they do not illuminate the road in front of the car at all.  There is a single adjust for both high and low beam lights so if you take your car to the dealer they will misalign the low beam focus if you complain of the faulty high beams.  I drive 70 miles at night on a desert highway to work daily, if you drive your M45 in town this will not be an issue."
infiniti,m45,2007,Dave, 07/10/2007,Outstanding Sport Sedan-Best for the US!,5,"I test drove BMW 335i and xi, 328xi, and 535i and xi, and although these cars were more aggressive driver's cars than the M45 sport sedan, I purchased the Infiniti.  Major deciding points:  M45 was priced similarly to the 335xi, but had more power, better features, and much better interior than any of the BMWs.  If I were driving in Europe, I would buy the BMW, but in the US, the M45 Sport is a better package and it is cheaper!!  By the way, the 328xi and 530xi do not even compete with the M35, let alone the M45.  If you are seriously considering any version of the 2007 328 or 2008 530, do yourself a favor and compare it to the M35/45. Infiniti clearly beats these cars!"
infiniti,m45,2007,Matt Johnson, 08/08/2006,My M45,4,Only negative with sport model is that you will DEFINITELY need snow tires for any kind of winter driving.
infiniti,m45,2007,dfcarter24, 09/13/2007,Best car yet!,4,"Being my first sedan since my 1989 Ford SHO, and many Suburban and pickups in between, I spent 1 year researching and dreaming of what I wanted in a sports sedan. The Infiniti M45 Sport has exceeded all my expectations. My only complaints would be the poor fuel mileage (what did I expect in a 335 hp hot rod?), perceived need for a six-speed transmission, and the non-effective high-beam headlights. But these complaints would not deter me from buying this car all over again. I probably should have sprung for the Bose 5.1 surround-sound system, but the regular Bose system is certainly no slouch. Fresh off a mountain romp through the twisties, the smile on my face could very well be permanent!"
infiniti,m45,2007,ignacio garcia, 06/11/2009,Japan made a good sport sedan,4,"After researching several cars in this class including the BMW550 and the Lexus IS350 and others, I selected the M45Sport for its handling and value.  Two problems for a 65 year old like me are: 1) Stiff ride for long trips.  2) Road noise.  Gas mileage is another problem.  Toyota has the technology backwards:  If you want the sensing of front traffic while on cruise control or lane change notice, then push a button not the other way around.  Excellent car overall."
infiniti,m45,2007,Brad, 09/22/2006,Our 4th Infiniti,5,"We had a 2003 M45, we thought that car was nice.  The 2007 is night and day.  Beats the 550 in every way"
infiniti,m45,2007,Dan, 09/28/2007,M45 Review,3,"While this car is complete with everything, the only thing that is in need of improvement is the Sport Rims.  The car runs fantastic with every possible feature, DVD, Bluetooth, navigation with voice recognition, etc.  However, the roads here in New England make sense for stronger sport rims as they are built too soft and have twice caused major cracking to the wheels which had to be replaced. While this is a not necessarily a flaw, normal driving conditions in New England include potholes, and hindsight is 20/20 and I would have chosen different more durable rims, although the sport rims give a better appearance.

After ~6 weeks of driving we are extremely pleased with the comfort and performance (not surprising considering our last vehicle was a Toyota Sienna minivan).  The disappointment is the mileage is at the low end of its rating (we're getting ~20 mpg when gas is >$3/gallon!).  We test drove the Lexus GS 350, Mercedes E350 and Acura RL.  The M has the comfort and peformance we wanted."
infiniti,m45,2007,brobob, 09/05/2008,My last car,4,I have had my eye out for this car ever since I heard there would be a replacement for the Ms. Right away I loved the look of it from every angle. My last car was an Infiniti and I have found that Infiniti treats its customers right. It has the good power that  require. When I first heard the 5.1 sound system I was sold. The car feels and sounds solid. A little too much road noise when the road has thumps. Other than that I love the car. 
infiniti,m45,2007,rmelli, 03/26/2007,m45,5,"I have the M35X not the 45. I find the 6 to be big enough to get me out of any tight spots without any requirement for a larger engine. The car is a wonderful machine. I had to get used to the dash system, but once mastered it became very easy to navigate. I look forward to driving this car as it handles like a dream in the curves an open road. I have owned two Lexus a 2001E and 2000G. Both were wonderful cars but I like my Infinity best of the three."
infiniti,m45,2007,Don, 05/23/2007,Love this car,5,"I recently purchased this car and loved the way it handled. I just traveled from Florida to Virginia and back, and that's when I really appreciated the car's handling and features. The navigation system routed me differently than I usually go, and it turned out better. The steering control of the bluetooth phone, stereo, and cruise control was great. The gas mileage was a little lower (19.2 MPG) than I would like, but the power and comfort made it worthwhile."
infiniti,m45,2007,Jim Cahill, 12/03/2007,Most fun sedan I have ever owned,4,"Overall, this is a great sedan.  The mileage is rated at 17 city and 23 highway and I have been averaging about 19 combined.  I live in Minnesota and we had our first major snowfall yesterday.  With rear wheel drive and the all season tires it did not perform well so I am having some snow tires put on.  That should make a huge difference."

infiniti,m45,2007,Susan Real, 02/11/2017,Best Car Yet!,5,"I purchased this car after owning a G35 and I must say I absolutely love this car!!! It handles the road so well and it accelerates just as smooth. I must admit there are a few features that should had been standard such as and Auxillary plug which is pretty common in most vehicles as well as a bluetooth system that allows me to connect my music, not just my phone. Another feature I'd like to see is the automatic wipers. Overall, I think this car is amazing, it's a vehicle that I will keep for years to come.

infiniti,m45,2008,MTCS, 02/06/2009,Good solid vehicle,4,"I traded in a 2009 Maxima for the 2008 M45X (new). This is a very nice luxury vehicle. It has all the toys inside that the BMW 5 series has. The smart cruise control is awesome. This vehicle accelerates very quick.  This car is a keeper. It is not a head turner. I think the  goodies inside with all the electronic gadgets you get to play with is where you get your monies worth out of 2008 M45X. The surround sound is awesome.  Pretty quiet ride, not as smooth on rough roads as I was expecting. On the highway you cannot tell the difference between 75 and 90 mph. Simply a well built machine.  I had buyers remorse initially but the car has won me over, this car is a keeper!"
infiniti,m45,2008,Joe Warner, 10/01/2008,Best car ever owned.,5,"The 2008 M45x is one of the most luxurious and best handling sedans in this category.  It may not be the best in every category but the combination of luxury, performance and features is excellent."

It has good acceleration, its comfortable and its stylish but not over the top.  It doesn't attract too much attention but when I sit inside I feel pampered.  Good features are ride and technology.  Bad features are gas mileage and noise level."

The car has great power and acceleration, and a sporty stance.  The exterior is not quite as aggressive as it could be, but whatever the exterior lacks, the interior quickly makes up for.  The interior design, layout, and overall look is amazing!  The ambient lighting is beautiful and the control console is like none other.  The comfort is tremendous in this car and is spacier than almost any car in its class in this price range.  Overall, it is a beautiful car and does everything that I need it to."
infiniti,m45,2008,MTCS, 02/18/2009,Not as flashy but just as nice,4,"Traded in a 09 Maxima for the 08 Infiniti M45X. I test drove the 08 G37 and a 08 BMW 550. The G 37 actually drives better but I figured I would get the top of the line and go with the M. The car does not turn heads but as the other reviewer put it, you get pampered when you get inside. I had a Maxima prior to this so I understand all the gadgets. Everything is laid out well. It has great power, you will not get embarrassed on the acceleration lane and on a smooth road you cant tell the difference between 65 and 85. The surround sound is like a concert hall.  Around town the ride is a little bouncy, you will feel most bumps in the road and the M goes through gas.  "

Interior is quiet and serene at high speeds. I find myself regularly doing 100-120mph without even feeling it. Exhaust note is sweet. The best low beam headlights in any car I've driven (the road is evenly carpeted with bright white light) but strangely very lousy high beams. Leg room in the front and back is class leading"

This particular M has all the packages minus sport and all wheel drive. The Tech, Premuim and Comfort packages are amazing. 14 speaker Bose surround sound with drop down DVD player are a plus with the power reclining rear seats. The only draw back on this vehicle for me is the road noise. That being said, I just turn the music volume up a bit. Which never hurts my feelings. Overall, I love this car.

infiniti,m45,2008,Mouseclick, 04/21/2008,Better Than All Competitors,4,"After thoroughly reviewing several cars from BMW (3 and 5 series), Jaguar (XF), Mercedes (C class), Lexus (IS F), I settled upon the M45 sport, almost fully loaded (lacks mobile DVD system).  Some of these cars are like comparing apples to oranges but, the M45 above all others is best in overall value to performance  it has the best of all worlds.  It offers great performance, plenty of space, excellent design and the best technology features of anyone.  While all the other cars were always sorely lacking in some features (for example, the IS F lacks space, the Jag lags in technology, etc.), the M45 simply glimmers best in everything overall, and at a respectable price comparatively."

Perfectly comfortable inside and outside. Excellent nav system, very useful rear view camera (day or night), especially for parking in tight places, plenty of power.   Overall 9/10, only because I know, there is better cars out there which I have not tried yet."

It was ""used"" with 3,700 miles and includes the Sport, Tech and Advanced Tech packages, which are just about everything you'll need unless you are shuttling around some very special friends.  (The only thing it's missing is the reclining, heated rear seats... boohoo.)  I looked at dozens of cars before finding this one at an incredible deal.  Giving up a Porsche 911, I wanted power... check.  I also wanted something luxurious... check.  All without making me feel like I should be twice my age in order to drive it... that's where the Sport Pkg comes in.  This car handles incredibly well for something this big and the acceleration nearly matches my 911."

I don't find the control center confusing, but rather find it loaded with useful features.  I push the car hard on winding roads and I find it very responsive and easy to handle. (It compares favorable to BMWs I owned in the past.)  The gas mileage is not good, but that is the only disappointment (especially when premium hit $4.00 in Santa Barbara.)  All together, I highly reccomend this reasonable priced luxury sport sedan.                            "

Nissan really listened when they built this. Everything has improved, and the additional horsepower puts it into a different league.  I love the ride - feels more substantial, and corners like it's on rails with breathtaking acceleration.  My wife says it reminds her of our BMW 750 - but more fun, with a sexier interior and exterior.  Electronics, back up cam, sound system, etc. all exceptional.  They even added a heated steering wheel and retractable outside mirrors.  The dial-a-transmission is very clever. Bravo!  "

Most because of the reliability of their vehicles and my experience owning an impressive car. I wanted to stay with an 8 cyl car. Not many people are aware of this vehicle since it debut in 2011. However, with minimum exterior aftermarket additions I LOVE my car even more.  Wish I could upload a picture. I have had a lot of people ask what year in my car? They find it hard to believe its an 2011. However, since the Q series have came on the scene people are more gear towards the new looks of the car. I love the way my car drives and feel on the road. Its a bigger car but handles fairly well for its size.

Once we found out they don't even make the part anymore and had to have the part actually made in Japan and sent to US. Took weeks to get the car repaired.  None of the repairs have taken a short period of time. Now a piece broke off and shards of metal went in the engine and they say we need a new engine.  After so many times of having to fix this car, the Infinity rep was asked to pay for the new engine and they said no.  Why make a part that if it  breaks would shatter and go into the engine and cause you to have to have a new engine????  They said they would put the car back together (with the shards in the engine) and if it broke down again they would give us an employee discount on a new vehicle. If it breaks down because of the shards in the engine the engine could just stop, would you want that to happen if you or your child were driving the car?    A 2011 model and they discontinued making certain parts for it?  They put in parts that if they break cause engine damage!!!   Think before you buy."

The car handles crisply and when you accelerate you'll think someone snuck a V8 into the engine compartment.  It does 0 - 60 in about 5.5 seconds.  My previous Infiniti was a G35x, also an excellent car but with under-specd brakes.  The Q40 has fixed that issue nicely.  Plus fuel economy is decent.  I can easily drive from Salt Lake to Las Vegas on a single tank of gas.  Overall, I get around 22 mpg.

If you can’t handle that noise I recommend you to buy Honda Fit and enjoy it.
The one thing which must be done and forgotten was the rim size at least they must have to come with 20-22’ rims coz when you hit bumps you feel how the rim size is smaller for the car, beside that I recommend everyone to give it a try.
"
infiniti,q40,2015,Brandon Smith, 02/19/2016,Don't call this a luxury car,1,"I have owned my 2015 Q40 for almost 2 years now and it is the most disappointing vehicle I have ever owned. I thought I was buying a Luxury vehicle as it as touted as one and the price matches or exceeds other comparable small Luxury sedans.

The only upside is that the car does have a good amount of power and is quick but other than that really has nothing going for it.

The interior is very cheap with plastic everywhere and everything squeeks and already seems to be falling apart. Technology in the car is reminiscent of a vehicle from 2000, the lcd screen looks horrible and barely has any features or control over it. 

The gas mileage is abysmal, I do about a 50/50 mix of highway/city and I have never exceeded 15.5MPG! My last car was a large four door sedan that weighed almost 1500lbs more and was from 2004 but it got around 19MPG.

The Infiniti dealer network and support from Infiniti USA is just downright horrible. Purchasing the car was not made easy at all, and I cannot even get a response from Infiniti when trying to contact their support.

If you are looking for a true Luxury vehicle and a Luxury experience steer clear of Infiniti as pretty much any of the other Luxury brands will give you a better product for a better price.

infiniti,q40,2015,Feng Guo, 12/18/2015,2015 Infiniti Q40 AWD causes me tinnitus and heari,1,"I bought this new 2015 Infiniti Q40 AWD from Beshoff Infiniti (San Jose) on Feb 28, 2015. After driving this noisy car for three months, or about 3000miles, I started having ringing in both ears (tinnitus). It became more and more obvious after I drove this Q40, and I have trouble to sleep since then. I also start losing my hearing in both ears, especially for the low voice from a meeting in a group or in a noisy environment, or someone with bass voice in the phone. I have contacted Beshoff Infiniti in June 2015 when I noticed the tinnitus caused by the noise.  They refused to take the car back with full refund and claimed that it’s normal car noise. I took my doctor’s suggestion to wear earplugs when driving this Q40 since then. After another 6 months of driving (total mileage is 10,000miles now), the tinnitus and my hearing didn’t get better, and it’s boring me a lot, both in my life and work. I contacted the dealer and the car maker again this month. They asked me to do a second road test and still claimed that it’s normal road noise. But this “normal” noise is killing me and I don’t think I can drive this car anymore.
 Because the dealer and Infiniti refused to help me with the problem, I did some noise tests and analysis myself, to figure out what’s going on. According to the result from Adobe Audition CC, a professional audio analysis software, the noise mainly from 100-400 Hz, that is the low frequency noise not sensitive to human being. This means, even if the driver didn’t hear the noise, the energy carried by this sounds will still go through the ear and damage the auditory nerve cells without immediate impact. The symptom is, you may not hear a loud noise (at 6000-8000Hz), but your ears are in the pain. The low frequency noise of this Q40 AWD carried much higher energy than another model made by Infiniti, the Q50, at this range. This indicates that the company has the technology and capability to reduce the noise, but they did not apply it to Q40 for some reason.
 I am in the progress of negotiation with Infiniti regional affair manager now. Infiniti remains to claim it’s the normal noise, and because it not the defect on any part of the vehicle, they cannot repair it or give a full refund as I requested, neither the compensation to the health damage on me. With no concern on the fact that this noise already caused severe and permanent health damage to the customer, Infiniti refuse to recall the cars and investigate the potential harm of the noise to the customers. It’s always difficult for individual to negotiate and reach desired outcome with the big company.  So far, total 8574 of Infiniti Q40 were sold in U.S. since Jan 2015 ( Infiniti sales stats: http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2011/01/infiniti-g-sales-figures.html, the sales dropped from 1000 to 38 by Nov. 2015 ).  All these customers may suffer from the same noise. Some of them may have family members riding with them, including children. As a Ph.D. in Biology, I am aware that the auditory nerve cells are the only type of cell that cannot regenerate in human body. Once you lose the hearing, you lose it permanently. The public should be alerted that there is potential risk to drive this car, for both the current Q40 owners and the potential buyers. 
If you are the current owners of this model of Infiniti Q40 and have the same problem with it, please contact Infiniti regional affair.

But it is comfortable, reliable (after a few expensive fixes to a vintage luxury car notably the shocks) and is fun to drive.  It is safe (I was rearended in a 98 q45 and it was totaled, but I thought it was minor damage right away) and you will win in an accident.  The engine and transmission will last forever, but you will replace the injectors and coils in the around 180K for sure.

We have not had one single problem with it, unlike the problems that we have heard about with the G35. I don't understand why Infiniti changed the body style.  The 2001 is so much better looking, in my opinion."
infiniti,q45,2002,Rick Sparks, 11/17/2015,Mr. Q45 Still Rocks,5,"Back in the 90's, my wife & I bought a used '90 Q45, the first year of Infiniti's new sedan competitor to Lexus, BMW, Mercedes and Cadillac. All these years later, we remember that car with great affection - understated yet classy design, beautiful interior w. lots of room (but not too big), and for the owner who loves to drive, great suspension and ride combined with a world-class 4.5 liter V8 that loved to run. And all with Japanese reliability.

Lately, we've thought a lot about that early Q. When it came time to replace my 150k mi. Mercedes E320, we chose a 79k mi. '02 Q45. The '02 was the first year of the 3rd generation, but everything about the earlier Q45 still applies. Best of all, the final series Q has no real weaknesses as a used-car buy; no air suspension to leak, no Northstar engine to fail, no complex electronics and no current dealers who hate to see an older Q come through the service bay. Our local Infiniti dealer treats my 14-year-old Q as if it were a new Q70.

In searching for our '02, I discovered: 1) there are relatively few 3rd gen Q45s out there - Infiniti just didn't sell many new, and 2) most 3rd gen Q45s have accumulated over 100k miles. That said, I found a relatively low mile (79k) example about 100 mi. away w. great body/paint/interior and accident-free history. Service records are always a plus, but (sadly) not that common; a pre-purchase inspection is always a good idea, as is a search for customer (& BBB) ratings of the dealer you're buying it from.

For the new owner of a used Q, the climate and audio controls on the 2002-2006 series require a bit of reading in the owner's manual, but are actually very logical (if not intuitive) and work fine. The interior design, especially the dash & center console, is both gorgeous and trend-setting; the current Q70 interior design is very similar. Large, supportive seats come complete with lumbar support for the driver & are the most comfortable of any car I've owned in 45 years of driving. That includes a healthy number of BMWs, Jags and Caddys.

The Q45 was designed as a grand tourer in the European tradition - fast, comfortable & stylish transportation that can devour continents. Infiniti succeeded at a price that undercut their competitors by thousands. Although some regard the 3rd gen Q45 as somewhat quirky (headlight design, HVAC interface, transmission in permanent sport mode), the car's comfort, performance and space make it a true driver's car you can live with. You won't win any economy runs with it (20 mpg in mixed driving), and given the slightly numb steering, the Q is not exactly a canyon-carver, but it will get you there in a hurry with comfort & panache to spare. Those Gatling-gun headlights are the bomb, but be sure to follow the owner's manual suggestion to avoid turning the headlights on for very short periods; that apparently will burn out the ballast much faster, which is not cheap to replace (removal of the front bumper is required.)

Maintenance is straightforward - just keep the 5W40 oil changed (synthetic, of course), put on a quality set of tires (I'm running new Pirelli P7s), and basically maintain it w. fresh coolant every 3 years or so, good brake pads and new engine air & cabin air filters once a year. And don't skimp on using recommended premium fuel - that thoroughbred 4.5 liter V8 will be much happier. Keep it clean & enjoy the fact that you own one of the world's great super sedans: the Q45.

UPDATE: Six months in, I'm still happily driving my '02 Q45, albeit after investing some money to bring it up to standard mechanically & cosmetically. 

I decided to spend $200 at my local Infiniti dealer to update the transmission software to make the throttle more responsive; they also replaced the electronic accelerator pedal w. a new design. After the upgrade, the throttle response is much better, although the transmission remains
 prone to stay in a lower gear too long when accelerating at anything other than a leisurely rate; it's as if it's in permanent ""sport"" mode. I also had the dealer change the transmission fluid/filter ($100) & do a proper 4-wheel alignment ($90). After the alignment, the car tracks/feels much better now going down the road.

I also spent $500 to have the front bumper removed & professionally refinished/painted; the original paint was wearing 80k miles' worth of scrapes & scratches. Other expenses since purchase include new Pirelli P7s, new brake discs/pads front & rear and a new cabin air filter. 
 
UPDATE #2: Our Q45 has accumulated 13,000 miles of daily driver use in a year with zero repair costs & no problems. Average 20.4 MPG in mixed driving; oil consumption averages 1 quart/5k mi., which seems normal from everything I've read about this engine. Fabulous car, great value, glad I bought it.

FINAL UPDATE (April '17): Sold the Q a couple of months ago! Fabulous vehicle, still highly recommended, just too much car for a daily driver. Replaced it w. a 2010 VW Jetta. :)

No more hesitation on takeoff.  The first part of the fix replaces the accelerator pedal with one with a bit less lag in the pedal itself. Nice update. Good update. The second part of the update doesn't involve any new parts - it is all ones and zeros, but it's what makes the big difference.  It's gone from Oldsmobile shifting (no offense) to German shifting, and from a stop the car feels so much faster. It reprograms the Engine Control Module. Shifting and acceleration are totally different. "

It now has 165K on the odometer and in those 50 thousand miles all I've had to fix was one wheel bearing (other than routine tires/brakes/plugs).  That's fantastic.

brakes and handles very well in heavy

the smart cruise control is brilliant.

I did a lot of research, drove them all, and am a former MB, BWM, and Lexus owner.  I had a down payment on another BMW 530i and then stumbled over the Infiniti.  I hadn't even considered the Q - mistakenly thought it was in a higher price range.  Drove the Q, bought the Q."

The last Q kind of left me cold, boring ""anycar""  styling, perfect for the old Caddy set.
This is another beast altogether. It is fast first of all. The ride and balance of the car rivals anything BMW has to offer (I just sold my 740) and there nothing in the Lexus stable that can even come close the the zest this car offers to the driver. It is unstated yet elegant and did I mention that it was fast. 
The car is deceptive and I was horsing around one time around a curve where I295 dumps into I95 and realized I was doing 135 when it felt more like 75. Be careful with this car, did I mention that it was fast?"

And, a bunch of deer coming out in front of me no time to think. Each time the Q handled it with all being 'SAFE' and without 'INCIDENT' Sounds unbelievable!!! But 100 percent TRUE... I was in AWE!! 😊 I've never owned any car that would have been able to keep from colliding with the deer(s)!!! I'm a real lead foot. And I take 35 mi. Corners at 50+++. Handle's GREAT!!!

I believe that this is exactly what F50 Q owners have done.

the acceleration didn't impress like I 
thought it would.  I read that the 
gearing would be improved for 2003, so 
I waited.  Another test drive and I was 
sold.  You can really feel the 
difference.  The feeling of your

After purchasing in February 2015, the car failed to start in December 2015, stranding us at the local shopping mall. When we took it in to have it looked at, we were told that we weren't driving it enough to keep the battery charged. (It was our intention to drive it sparingly to help maintain its value). By October 2016 the new battery had died, stranding us again, even though we had driven it at least 30 minutes every 3 days as instructed. This time we were told that the car was engineered to only charge periodically while running so as to increase gas mileage. If we wanted to keep the battery from dying, we had to drive it even more, or put it on a trickle charger when we weren't driving it. When we bought the car, we weren't told any of this. Didn't know we were buying an electric car that had to be plugged in every night!

infiniti,q60-convertible,2015,Jeff S., 06/29/2020,Best hair dryer I ever owned,5,"I bought this car new in January 2016 and still haven't seen anything else I'd rather own (at the price). I chose it over the Lexus 350 IC convertible.

It performs great, and the 7-speed auto tran is very responsive and using the paddle shifters is the next-best thing to a manual transmission. It is responsive at the throttle and brakes, steering is very good but not much road feedback through the wheel, and suspension is appropriately tuned (though some people will find it stiff).

It is very comfortable for the front seat occupants but don't take back-seat passengers any farther than down the street--it's cramped back there. The trunk holds a lot more than you would guess, but when the top is down there is just enough space for a gym bag. I thought that might be a problem but after 4.5 years I found it worth the tradeoff. I'm a gigging musician and with the top up I can get an amp, guitar, fold-up cart, and gear bag in the trunk. If I want the top down, all of that is going in the seats.

WIth the top down, you've got a hardtop car. It might be just a little noisier in the rain than a true hardtop, but otherwise is pretty quiet and has much more structural integrity than my Solara soft-top. The retraction is fully automatic. You have to hold the button down until it finishes with a beep. I have found a couple of times that the top won't move up or down if the engine is not running. It is random so maybe the battery doesn't generate enough current. Also there have been a couple of times where it won't move even with the engine running; I stopped the car and restarted, so I chalk it up to ""needed to reboot.""

The only problem I've had is the bluetooth audio connection is very slow to connect to my phone (I've tried other phones, it's not the phone). It connects right away for making calls but takes 2-4 minutes before it is ready to play audio.

The GPS system, like every other built-in one I've used, works well but the menu navigation is counterintuitive. I have a similar problem on my two Toyotas.

Controls on the door (windows, mirror adjustment, mirror retraction) require an awkward reach around the grab handle.

The auto climate control is well-featured but like every other one I've tried, seems sensitive to the air temperature, not your temperature. So the A/C will not be cold enough if the sun is beating on you. And on a cold day, when you start up the heater does not blow the hottest possible air to warm things up, so I set the temperature all the way up until the interior is comfortable then I switch it back to the target temp.

Overall this car has been a great value for the price. I got a pretty good deal because it was over a year after the model year was released and I think the dealer wanted to make room for the 2017's to come in. I suspect the convertible was not super popular.

My fuel mileage with city and highway driving has averaged 22.3 miles/gallon.
The car has great acceleration and handling.
I'm 6 feet tall 250 pounds and would not recommend the car for anyone larger than me.
I am very happy with the car.
I purchased mine as a certified pre-owned for $33,000 with 12,000 miles.
As far as value for the money, nothing else comes even close.
The car has also been very reliable.
At 37,500 miles, I just replaced the tires and brakes all the way around.
The trunk is a little tight, but I am able to get my golf clubs, two pair of golf shoes, shag bag, 2 golf shirts, 3 golf towels, and golf supplies in trunk.
I think they should have just made the car a 2 seater like the 370Z and increased the trunk storage.
I am very happy with my purchase.
Now 53,000 miles no problems....replaced brakes at 40k with ray asbestos  hybrid & happy with them...
Now with 83,000 miles....replaced brakes and tires at 80K...rotors still good. I am still using the original battery ....load tests fine, but will probably replace soon.
The only problems I have with the car are 1. Switch to control passenger window on drivers side is starting to act up...sometimes window does down an inch then stops...will probably have to be replace...when IPhone updated to IOS 10 could not receive phone calls on bluetooth hands free...can make outgoing but not receive. Cannot update or download software on-line....must take to Infiniti dealer and they want $80....I'm pretty disgusted with them and have been living with this inconvenience.

Now with 88k miles no new problems....Decided to change OEM battery about 2 months ago prior to failure....barely passed load test. Switch to control passengers window seems fine now....never replaced. Still living with Bluetooth inconvenience. Still fun to drive, great reliability, and over all very happy with purchase....My only beef I have is that you have to use premium gas or it could damage the engine...At the present, premium costs 60 cents more per gallon than regular. I've tried running regular and noticed reduced performance.

Now with 95K....no problems....changed rear differential, transfer case, and transmission fluid...pretty straightforward, but cannot replace trans filter(Infiniti says lasts life of car and no part available). Plan on replacing spark plugs....have to remove throttle bodies to reach, but will clean them, too. Also, will check serpentine belt, hoses, and antifreeze before winter, but I think the belts and hoses are OK. I changed antifreeze at 50K and will probably change again after replacing plugs. I am still happy with purchase. Car has had no major problems and so far have just had to do normal maintenance.

105K Now....changed plugs....everything is fine.....no problems very reliable vehicle.

infiniti,q60-coupe,2014,tap, 10/15/2015,Fun to drive reliable vehicle!,4,"Leased this vehicle in AWD about a year ago. Have never had a problem with it.  Great looking and great reliability. Love the performance and AWD drive system. Stock tires relay road noise but stick well.  I run winter tires to enhance Snow/Ice traction and will take it anywhere. Technology is good, but not great compared to today's standard, but new model years promise upgrades in that area.  I have this on a special lease program for 24 months and its coming near it end.  I wish I would have taken a longer lease, I really enjoy this vehicle.  Some earlier comments referenced poor MPG, but I get from 21-24MPG in a mixture of driving conditions. The requirement for Premium fuel is a draw-back.  Just typically Me or Me and my spouse in the vehicle so the limited back seat space and truck space has not been an issue for us.

infiniti,q60-coupe,2014,John L, 01/20/2018,More of the same which is good!!!,5,"Have owned 6 Infiniti cars and they continue to impress me...for the most part... This is my 3rd coupe but what bone head choose to move the seat controls to the side of seat!!!! Good thing there is a memory setting because unless the door is open you cannot adjust seat. Storage has always been a issue, but the car is a coupe not a wagon so live with it or buy a QX. Some storage net/bins at the sides of the foot wells would be a nice add for the odds and ends along with a legitimate berth on console for phone since we all have them. I rack 50 to 70k on these cars per year and it never gets old, Oil, Tires etc.... and muscle relaxers for the constant grin. I have owned BMW's, Audi, Corvette, Which are all top of the line equipment but the Infiniti has proven to be the constant no nonsense performer..... Note I was a test driver for one of the big three and have had the opportunity to experience many of the the magnificent automobiles produced and for the buck Infiniti is still a good bang both in durability and smile factor.

infiniti,q60-coupe,2014,CHILL will, 09/05/2016,HAPPY DRIVER,4,"What you should no before buying this car is that it is a sports coupe. So your not gonna get 30mpg. I recently brought a pre certified 2014 Q60 sport model with 12100 miles on it. I traded in my 2007 M35. So far I like this car a lot I think you get a lot of bang for your buck. I paid 30.000 bucks for mine financing approx 21000 after 10000 for my trade in. So yeah 30 grand for a car as close to new as you can get. Yeah it's a bang for your buck. I love the new 20017 Q60. But not ready to spend 56k. Yes the technology lil things like the infotainment system is a lil long in the tooth but still relevant.  As far as the gas not bad at all. I drive 53 miles a day back and forth to work. And a tank of gas last me the whole week. Handles beautifully especially around curves. And I dont know how anybody doesn't love that signature Infiniti roar that 3.7 liter v6 puts out. Again it's a sports coup people it's supposed to sound fun and be fun to drive.. Also yes the new models are turbo. But remember turbo is a he'll of a lot of money when the turbo malfunctions. One final thing I got a great warranty regular warranty expires 2018. Power train warranty as well as pre certified warranty expires 2020. So yeah I'm very very happy

infiniti,q60-coupe,2014,rich323, 08/26/2014,Q60 - What You Should Know Before You Buy,2,"2014 Q60 Journey - I generally agree with the Edmunds review, however, there are two things that I wish that I'd known before getting into a lease on this car, which would have swayed me in another direction: MPG & the awful entertainment system.

I've had the car a few days shy of five months and in that time I'm astounded at the poor gas mileage.
The EPA sticker estimate puts it at a 22-combined MPG; however, my best efforts at driving gas-wise have resulted in no better than 12.9 MPG combined (!). 

12.9 MPG is low by any standars-- and believe me you'll start to feel the hit in your wallet when filling that tank with premium.

infiniti,q60-coupe,2014,bdhotwheel, 12/13/2017,Pocket rocket - Q60,5,"The car is very sleek looking and handles very well. Acceleration is great and it has enough bells and whistles in the interior.

infiniti,q60-coupe,2014,Steve S, 12/27/2018,Japanese GT,4,"Got this as a trade-in at a Lexus dealer and paid $23.5K, loaded with only 11K miles. Fantastic deal used, but I would never have considered it new at almost $45K. The 3.7 engine pulls hard and sounds great doing it. I wish it had a manual (not offered with AWD), but the automatic is not bad and will hold gears to redline when hammering it. The car corners flat, the brakes are strong with a firm pedal and the steering has good heft and feel. The ride is not bad considering how well it handles and is tolerable even on bad roads. This is a well crafted car and the interior materials are all good quality although the seats are a bit too hard for long drives and the trunk and back seat are tight. No complaints with the Bose stereo which has clean sound and puts out strong bass. The navi is old school, but I use my phone so its not an issue.  So far, only routine maintenance and the mpg has been acceptable. It will get close to 30 on the highway at 65 but only 15 if you hammer it around town and I average around 19-21 in 50/50 driving.  These are supposed to be very reliable and -if used- offer outstanding bang for the buck (IMO).
35,000 mile update - No change. There is an occasional annoying squeaking sound from the front cowl area, but that's about it. Still fun.

40,000 mile update: I'm finding the seats uncomfortable for long drives and it chugs premium unleaded, but runs its a$$ off.  Some drops of water will occasionally come in at the driver side A pillar moulding, but otherwise no issues. The car's design has aged well (IMO) even if the tech is outdated. Its truly an old-school muscle grand tourer.
"
infiniti,q60-coupe,2015,Kailasa Ishaya, 02/17/2016,It's ALMOST perfect....,4,"I should probably start this off by saying I am a long-time Nissan fan.
My previous car was a '95 300zx TT that had been meticulously maintained, but was getting expensive to own.  I did consider a new Z; but the last several gens of Z's are just plain fugly to me; are cramped inside; and feel somewhat cheap. So, after testing the Q60S, 370Z, Lexus RC350 F-sport, Audi TT, Hyundai Genesis coupe, and the new Camaro, I decided for the Q60S.  (I almost went with the Genesis, but the Hyundai dealership here was [non-permissible content removed])

This Q60 Sport is a great car...except for a major flaw, and a few minor quirks. 
It's a blast to drive, VERY quiet, VERY comfortable, and has all the tech a spirited driver could ask for.  The driver's seat is one of the best I have ever planted my butt in, the controls are intuitive and well-laid out (though I would now recommend the shift paddles on the wheel), and I've never been able to get the car to lose its cool, even in a good rain!  The suspension is dialed in JUST right in my opinion - stiff enough for excellent handling, and supple enough to handle the 3rd World condition roads we have here in Hawai'i.  Visibility is good, and with the reverse sensors and camera, you're able to see it all.  Brakes are super and haul the car down fast.

The engine is a dynamo - it puts my old stock TT to shame.  I don't get what a lot of reviewers say about the engine being noisy - hell, for a 330hp V6 that has a 7000rpm redline, it's smooth and gives all the right noises and it lets the engine put out a few more ponies to boot.  Regardless, it sounds great, and I get a big grin every time I rev it!)

The major flaw - the transmission.  The 7AT in this car is VERRRRY slow in regular drive mode.  The tranny in my new Ford paratransit van is better...and that is a horrible thing to say.  
I've had the Q60s tranny software updated, and the tranny STILL just sucks.  Basically, it acts like it was programmed for best fuel economy and not performance! When warm, there is a hesitation from a stop - like the torque converter is bad; same thing happens around corners occasionally; and at other times it feels like the tranny is having trouble deciding what gear it wants to be in. This gets really frustrating with that 330hp on tap!  I drove a QX50 loaner once, and that car embarrasses my Q60s acceleration.  
The problem almost goes away when the tranny is in DS (manual sport) mode, but the shifts are still a little slow and the takeoff balky.  
The transmission in this car just kills the experience.
[UPDATE: - It appears the problem with this transmission is in the engine and transmission controllers - they don't handle a car using ethanol fuel (which we mainly have here in Hawai'i) when the ambient temperature is around 90 degrees.  I've switched to non-ethanol fuel, and/or dumping a bottle of octane booster in the tank, and this pretty much resolves the driveability problem.]
If you decide to get a Q60 coupe, and love to drive - get the MANUAL transmission.  I'm glad I only have a 2-year lease.  That's how badly the tranny irritates me.

My first little quirk is with the Climate Control.  I've had a number of cars with Climate Control, and it appears Infiniti decided to do things a little differently with their version.  For example, if you just want fresh air - you have to shut the system off, then turn on the fans, then lower the temp setting as far as you want, and then turn the A/C on, and then off.  Ridiculous!  If you don't do all those steps - even though the panel says NEITHER the temp control nor the A/C is on, they continue to work anyway!  Oh, and you can't have recirculating air unless the A/C is on.  There is also sunlight sensors on the dash that seem to override the temperature control.  In most cars, (even other Infinitis), I've always set the temp at 75, left it there and been happy.
  With this car, I have to keep changing the temp settings to keep from freezing!

Second quirk is with the doors.  The doors are damn heavy, and if there is any kind of strong breeze blowing, they are a bitch to open, and almost impossible to keep open!  I've had to come up with a new ""exit routine"" to keep from getting a leg caught in the door.

Last quirk - to me, even the upgrade Bose sound system's speakers sound muddy - NOT what I'm used to, as my 300zx had a Bose system.  The ""driver's stage"" setting on the system is cool - it's like surround sound, but the speakers need to be wayyyyy crisper in my opinion.  Subwoofer is pretty good, and it's nice to be able to tie my phone audio directly into the car system with a couple of button pushes. However, like most car makes these days, they are putting the subwoofers in the DOORS! This is really bad, because as the car gets more and more miles and age on it, the door panels make more and more vibration noise. I've had to get the dealership to fix that, because the car is otherwise so quiet the vibration noise is loud.

infiniti,q60-coupe,2015,Jorge, 07/22/2016,Excellent Car - Great Value,5,"After 105K miles and 7 1/2 years of ownership, it was time to change my beloved BMW 135i (I6 twin turbo 300HP/300torque / 6 manual) and I looked around high and low for a suitable replacement with a manual transmission. This is a review from BMW's owner perspective. My 2015 Q60S came fully loaded, in fact there were no options to add, which was quite funny and pleasant for me. The leather quality is good and craftsmanship is up to my old BMW. The technology in the car is great and Bluetooth and connections works well, the quality of the sound is very good but I miss the DSP capabilities of my old ride (no digital equalizer, etc). On the driving side, the engine feels powerful but in the high rev spectrum, it does not have the quick response of a twin turbo engine but feel agile enough, I have not explored the high end of the tachometer yet, but I am confident I will have a smile, it is still a 2,000 miles’ engine after all. The space in the back is enough for my 2 daughters on short trips and I am very pleased with the value and amenities of the car. Bottom line is, this car has a very reliable/trusted V6 engine, with Variable Valve and Lift technology but without the add ons that will cause constant repairs in a Turbo engine, like fuel pumps, positive crack valve, sensors, lean conditions, etc. It is a very powerful car and the delivery of the power is non-intimidating, has inexpensive components (normal spark plugs, spare tire, oil stick, jack, etc.) that will make you have a smile every time you have to service it. Missing points: The manual transmission feels normal, not really a short throw, crazy agility delivered close to 5K rpm, no 60/40 rear seat.

8,000 Update (Feb 2017)
Took a 500 miles trip with my 2 daughters and was nice. The engine has loosen up nicely and now I am enjoying a more spirited driving experience. The manual shifter has also become more engaging.
Things i like the most: Service experience at the dealer is great and so inexpensive (<50 USD for oil change). I know BMW service is included but let's talk after 48 months. The 3.7 variable valve with lift V6 engine is great and so engaging after 5K rpm, wonderful! The tires will not make it to 30K miles but I am sure it will be less expensive that run flats. Nothing has broken, no ratles and the leather seats look like new. Very happy with the Infiniti experience so far!
Details for improvement and why the germans can charge more: the headlights and fog lights have diferent color temperature, cruise control can have up to 5 mph variation, tilt the navigation a few degrees towards the driver, your right elbow does not have a support while shifting, shifter has to be 1 inch smaller.

One of the door locks broke, they want $2,000. The front seat motor breaks, $1500. This is on a car with 54,000 miles on it. None of it is covered.

(155k miles ) and it hasnt given me a reason to get rid of it. I've kept the scheduled maintenance up on it, and the only thing I've had to do outside of that, was replace items that would normally need replacing, like brakes, shocks, etc.
I got my money's worth on it.

Pros: Very reliable. Does good with towing, towed 4 sportsbikes from AZ to Cali and up and down hills didnt notice any drag. Aged well for the most part, still quiet, still comfortable, nothing leaking.

Cons: Not the fastest SUV out there"
infiniti,qx4,2001,jubal82, 12/02/2013,Simply admirable.,4,"Pros:

The reliability of Infiniti.
(engine/transmission never let you down)
The classic design.
(never get tired of the look)
The quiet city cruiser.
(car-like luxury-smoothness)
The able muscle on demand.
(whenever necessary @240hp) 
The attractive interior.
(quality leather all around)
The choice engineering.
(switchable Auto-2wd-4H-4L system)
The convenient features.
(4 seat heaters/2 auto seat adjustment)


Cons:

The gas guzzler. 
(15-17mpg)
The tiny legroom in the back.
(not easy to get in/out as well)
The rust issues underneath/fender areas.
(questionable building quality?)

I live in a rural area where it's 60%highway and 40% off-road driving."
infiniti,qx4,2001,ay9i, 09/12/2013,2001 QX4 in Canada - still going strong 2013,4,"170,000 kms and the only repairs have been engine coils at 150,000 ($900.) emissions sensor (2 @ $150 each) and air mass sensor ($300). The machine is excellent to drive in all conditions. The 4x4 system works very competently in snow and mud. The vehicle is well appointed, powerful, quiet and smooth. Extremely reliable.



Poor fuel economy & premium fuel
Cramped back seat (legroom)
Poor rust resistance *****

Anyone considering one MUST insist a shop remove the plastic covers over (esp. rear) wheels. EASY. A perfect looking vehicle can have BAD rust issues behind these
Must spray inner front fenders and under front of hood. These areas rust from behind & will ruin vehicle"
infiniti,qx4,2001,D. M. Weed, 12/25/2017,Great Value on a Solid Vehicle,5,"II picked up my QX4 in 2016 as a daily driver, a vehicle to park outside in all kinds of weather and not worry too much about its cosmetics.  It has proven to be reliable after I had a few issues related to age and mileage (181,000 when I bought it) addressed.  These are great vehicles—upscale materials, decent driving dynamics, and Nissan's bulletproof 3.5L V6—that are available nowadays for very little money.

The most serious issue on the QX4 is rust around the front strut towers (the front suspension can collapse if it isn't addressed), and although Infiniti will repair the problem under recall, it's a good idea to see whether the one that you're considering has a strut-tower rust problem before buying it.

The QX4 handles well, and the ride is good unless the pavement becomes uneven, and then it rides, well, like the truck that it is.  Don't expect it to ride like a newer unibody crossover in all situations.  Acceleration is decent, but the engine note makes the vehicle sound as if it is working hard to move.   The brakes are also decent but are not exceptional: it took me a few months to grow accustomed to the longer stopping distances required of a vehicle with rear drum brakes.

If the cheapish front disc/rear drum brake setup is the one cost-saving measure that I’ve noticed, then Infiniti also deserves kudos for spending money on the interior.  The leather on the seats is thick and high quality, the dash is made of solid material rather than clunky plastic, and the real wood trim is plentiful and gorgeous.  I also own a 2006 Infiniti FX45, which has a flashier interior that is also pleasant, but the materials in the QX4’s interior are simply more expensive and better.

Repair costs are reasonable since the QX4 is essentially a Nissan Pathfinder underneath the trimmings.  I consider my QX4 one of the nicest and best vehicle purchases that I've ever made.   I wanted a vehicle that could work, be fun to drive, and carry me in comfort; it has delivered on all counts.

A Final Update and Tribute

A 2014 Ford F-150 pulled out directly in from of me in my QX4.  I think that I had less than a second to react and t boned him in the driver’s side at about 40 mph.  The airbags deployed, but the passenger compartment remained intact and my passenger and I walked away uninjured.  (The driver of the F 150 also was not injured.)  Both vehicles were totaled.  I fear that my final comments on the QX4 have to be center on praise for its strength and safety.

infiniti,qx4,2001,darwinpost, 08/27/2011,Unibody Rust,2,"Right side unibody rusted out - the engine and front differential are connected to the frame which cannot effectively be repaired. Extreme safety hazard. If the unibody could be repaired, it would be temporary and pose a safety hazard for the next buyer and potential liability for the seller. Infiniti refuses to assume responsibility. Infiniti has repaired the driver's side strut tower housing, but does not acknowledge sever unibody rust. Dealer indicates other owners have same problem.

infiniti,qx4,2001,Mark M., 08/26/2009,Why did they stop making these?!,4,"I am a very particular buyer and I have to say my QX4 has exceeded all my expectations! I cannot say enough about this vehicle! Start with the engine, 240hp will move; no traffic conditions will deter you from going where you want to go! The 4 wheel drive system is excellent as well, just a click of the dial and you are good to go. It handled flawlessly last winter in a heavy snowstorm, while other cars on the road were crawling along at 25mph, I was instantly up to 40mph and felt like I was on dry pavement. Very confidence inspiring! The Infiniti gets looks everywhere I go and there's not a lot of these on the road which makes it even more unique! I love this SUV! Buy one, you'll thank me!"
infiniti,qx4,2001,Qx4Owner, 10/26/2006,Best SUV in it's class,5,"Before purchasing my QX4, I test drove every SUV in that class.  The QX4 is more powerful, but at the same time super luxury.  You feel the class as soon as you step into one.  The wood trim, analog clock and heated front seats are just a few items that make the QX4 a comfortable ride.  The 4WD is great in the snow; I was able to outmaneuver a friend of mines H2 Hummer.  Have had it for over 2 years now and cant image life without it."
infiniti,qx4,2001,MTMnet, 10/30/2005,Very Nice SUV! Bring back the QX4,4,Purchased it used with 95K miles and it feels almost like new.  Very nice inside and out. Drives great on smooth roads but is bumpy and truck like on bad sections of the freeway. I will try bringing the tire pressures down to 26lbs as recommended to see if that makes a difference. Otherwise the Q is excellent all around!
infiniti,qx4,2001,Ed, 04/02/2005,Great suv,4,"For the price, you can't beat this SUV.  If you're looking for a practical on-road SUV that drives like a car, look no further.  Auto-4wd makes it useful at city driving like AWD, but also has the benefits of 4wd off- roading."

chose Infiniti.  This is my first SUV, 
my other car is a Jaguar XK8, and I 
have very high standards, so I was 
apt to judge the QX4 rather harshly.  
But I LOVE this vehicle.  It's GREAT to 
drive - stable, comfortable, neither 
too big nor too small.  Plenty of 
features, nearly sumptuous interior, 
yet still a true off-road vehicle as well.  
It's hard to believe, but I appreciate,

Ride is real rough in the back and the cabin is a bit small, but at the time that i purchased it, there were not a lot of options in mid-sized SUVs. For a vehicle that mostly sits in a garage, around 6 yrs old it has had a lot of rust issues, mainly behind the fender flares and the running board. Infiniti would not do anything for me and wanted $1100.00 for new running boards. So I had a body shop redo the metal for the running boards for around $200.00 each. I do think I will by infiniti again, because they did not stand behind the rust guarantee. A $40,000.00 vehicle should not have rust that much so soon. "

Unfortunately, electrical problems have ruined an otherwise good ownership experience with our QX4. We should have seen the early warning signs. Had to replace the entire radio/CD player at 25,000 miles (under warranty), have replaced batteries once a year for a non start - completely dead issue - something creating a slow draw from the car when it sits parked. The longer it is parked, the more chance it won't start. Now that we're out of the warranty, CD player is again not working and the car needs to be jumped once a week. Take it to the dealer and no problems can be found."

The differential & drive shaft needed for rear wheel drive adds weight - for that reason gas consumption is a bit higher compared to contemporary non-SUVs. 2001+ models have the killer look - personally, I prefer it over the X5s and of course RX300 and M-Class. The front bezel and the wide three-spoke aluminum wheels (for 4WD trim) are both unique. The 4WD trim came with adequate and stylist standard features - Xenon HID head lamp,  sun/moon roof, 6CD Bose, electro-fluorescent dash, everything-power, leather, simulated wood-trim ... "

infiniti,qx4,2002,Mark, 10/19/2015,Love the Q! By far best vehicle I (we) have owned,5,"""Years ago I owned an 03 pathfinder that I loved. For the heck of it, I started to poke around looking at the Infiniti counter part (the Q) as I always thought they were really sharp looking. Ended up finding a low mileage 02, went to look at it, and it came home with me. That vintage pathfinder (01-04) was great (by far the best years they made), and the Q takes all that is great from the pathfinder, and steps it up a notch. First, mechanically, our Q (that we still own and is now 17 yrs old, 02 model built and sold in 01) has been nearly flawless mechanically...no, not just mechanically, overall. At 16 yrs old it was just in the need of some exhaust work (still all original) and shocks(despite no bouncing, clunking and tires still wear evenly).  She still rides excellent, and not 1 leak. Other than 1 small item (minor fix to climate control as blower was staying on) it has needed nothing. Really, nothing...and this car is loaded with options, that all still work. Just routine maintenance (oil changes, tires, etc.). Body is still tight (other than the running board supports rusting out - comon on these, but not the end of the world, easy fix - just some tiny rust spots starting now and I don't store it in the garage, and it has been in IL and WI - snow/salt - it's whole life), interior shows little wear (no cracks in leather, etc), and it is still a joy to drive. Plenty of power (240hp V6 also gets decent gas mileage), and timeless looks (still sharper looking than many new models, and not a ton of them on the road). Besides the sharp exterior looks, I believe it still has one of the most attractive and best laid out cabins (the dash, controls, gauges, etc...logical, and premium without being gaudy). Bottom line, I'd by another one if I could find a low mileage example...as anything newer I've looked at in the last 6-7 yrs, isn't an upgrade. Pick one up if you can it, and don't let mileage scare you, the Nissan 3.5L motor is one best out there (have read some reviews of drivetrains that put it in top 5 engines ever mass produced based on reliability, power and efficiency).""

infiniti,qx4,2002,danoqx, 10/27/2012,2002 Infinti QX4 Platinum Edition (Canadian Edition only),5,"This is without a dought the best vehicle I have ever owned, very reliable and super comfortable the engine is so smooth your not sure its even running. the only complaint is the gas mileage which everyone complains about with this engine however it is also very powerful so gas mileage is the tradeoff. I have 186,000 KMS now with no breakdowns except for changing the muffler and resonator. I have also owned a 2007 G35 and it also was a terrific vehicle but I found myself driving the QX4 most of the time so I sold the G35 to my son. I will continue to drive Infiniti or Nissan over other brands."

The only money I've spent on repairs was for a rattling heat shield early on. Aside from that, drivetrain has been bulletproof - no surprise as the VQ35DE engine was included in Ward's 10 Best for 2002. No squeaks or rattles - exterior and interior have held up remarkably well. CD player glitchy. Feels like a tank, which has its pluses and minuses - solid, but a bit underpowered; great towing (body-on-frame construction), but pretty poor fuel economy. Four-wheel-drive system is a technological marvel - has gotten me up a 45-degree snow bank with no wheelspin. Amazing truck - luxurious and reliable."
infiniti,qx4,2002,P-eye, 03/19/2007,Rust and Dealer Service,4,"purchased the vehicle new- love it but dealer service and backing leave a lot. Had it in for new wheels as the old bubbled and were replaced, no problem. Asked to check brakes- OK.  Less than 3000 miles later- new brakes, rotors etc.  Told underneath lots of rust- I asked why?  They had no answer. Less than 1000 miles later, needed rear muffler due to underneath rust. Unfortunately, now out of time on warranty (miles are way under).  Even with extended Infiniti warranty neither Infiniiy nor the dealer will address why there is so much rust underneath the vehicle. It has been no other places that any other vehicle I have owned has been. Love the SUV but probably will not buy another Infinity."

It had been totaled and required a lot of repair work, but because of the salvage title, it was less than half the bluebook price.  OK, a gamble, but everything worked perfectly.  My first long-distance trip up the coast left me giddy with delight at the performance and handling of this vehicle. Outside temperature of 112 degrees, a very long steep grade to climb.. I left air conditioning on full blast, cruise at 70 mph..and the QX4 ran up the hill like it was going downhill. Temp gauge didn't move. I knew then this was a keeper! Four years later and I'm still in love with this vehicle. Careful smooth driving gets me 15/16 mpg city, 23/24 highway."

extremely spunky. The slight negatives 
I have are that the AC is able to cool 
the entire vehicle very well until the 
outside temp gets to the low 90's, and 
after 20,000 miles, there is some 
vibration when breaking from high 
speeds which I was told can be taken 
car of when I get my brakes done. The 
anti-lock brakes have probably saved me 
from a couple of accidents.

After looking at a dozen, or so, I realized my 6' 5"" frame isn't well-received by the 4Runner's cramped interior, nor is the 3.4L (fabulously over-built engine) engine adequate to haul around the 4Runner's rump.  Enter the QX4. The Infiniti was my ONLY alternative to the 4Runner, which is saying a lot. While the Infiniti isn't a body-on-frame SUV, it still has a rugged aura about it.

Never had anything but routine maint. before I bought it and hasn't had anything but that since I've owned it.  Had a 4Runner, than a Pathfinder now the Q.  All great vehicles, but this one is my favorite (yes even over the newer models of the aforementioned).  Although we all know it is a gussied up Pathfinder, it really isn't.  Same great reliability, and performance but much better styling, features.  Not as many on the road (be different), still looks better than most SUVs even though it is 5 yrs old (timeless style). Everything about it just feels right, solid, fits.  Definitely the best vehicle I have owned (and I've had a couple people's share)!!"
infiniti,qx4,2002,samwong, 03/08/2002,Pretty Good SUV,4,"Have this SUV for a month now, everything's running great. A very smooth vehicle, live up to expectation, no complains. We chose the Infiniti over the Nissan after seeing the vehicle in person, we feel it is worth the extra money, the material and workmanship is much better than the pathfinder. Go for it."
infiniti,qx4,2002,SUV hoper, 10/29/2007,Still the Best Midsize SUV,4,"I have owned a 4Runner, a couple of Pathfinders and my QX4.  Have also spent some time with a friends RX 330.  Even though this car is now nearly 6 yrs old, I still believe it is one of the best mid-size SUVs out there.  The style is still unsurpassed, great std. and optional features, excellent overall quality and reliability, and decent performance.  A shame that they discontinued it. Although the undercarriage may be the same as the pathfinder (not a bad thing), it trumps the pathfinder in style and refinement.  Line it up against the 07 midsize SUVs, and it would still stand out.  One of the best vehicles I have owned."

infiniti,qx4,2002,OZ, 08/05/2020,Impressive SUV !!!,5,"I got 200,000 miles out of this 2002 heavily optioned SUV. Still driving it after owning it for eleven years. Gonna take it to 250K miles if it doesn't cost major bucks.    No major repairs, just mainly regular maintenance. Had to do the replace the usual cooling system at around 185K. (cap,thermostat,radiator and flush), rear shocks and struts about 150K. That was the worst of it. Regular tune-ups at 30K.... don't believe the hype of 100K tune-ups. Plugs are a wear item. I use iridium/plat Denso plugs and pull them at 30K. They will last to 40K but I need better mileage, with the 2 buck plus gas these days. It takes 3 darn hours to replace plugs and spray out MAF sensor!!  Getting around 16 mpg, mostly with 70 mph.  Avg=16-18 mpg.  Thrilled to own a pre 2005 nissan/infiniti vehicle. You should know that Renault now owns these companies. Will be the last Infiniti I will own sadly. If you get one of these, cherish it and keep up the maintenance. It will kick down the road and take whatever you throw at it and say ""job done"".  It even comes with heated rear seats!! The sound system is 150 watts Bose. Not a lot of bass but enough even without the sub-woofer that I was hoping for. A super quality vehicle with a classy interior. If you are lucky enough to snag one of these after a good check-up by a mechanic..... grab it.  Would I recommend the Infiniti QX4 2001-2003 .....Heck yeah!!! "

Car is fast once you get going. It is probably the most comfortable car to drive. The sound system is incredible. It could be better with more bass but its good.

infiniti,qx4,2003,rohitra, 03/02/2012,Great SUV for two,3,"This is a very good looking sturdy SUV and a great second hand buy. It is basically a luxury Nissan Pathfinder, with an auto (AWD) mode, although the AWD mode is not that effective.
Compared to a Lexus or Acura, the suspension is stiffer and cabin noise is higher.
My biggest regret with this vehicle (which I should have checked when I bought) :
The rear seating is very uncomfortable, there is hardly any headroom and sits very high. If you plan on using a car seat DO NOT BUY buy this SUV. The passenger door entry is narrow and the seats being high, moving a toddler in and out of the car seat is not a pleasant affair."

I has required no repairs, gets reasonable gas mileage and will go anywhere (the 4X4 feature really works) and cost me 2600 when I bought it. I own Four 4 wheel drive vehicles, everything from a setup jeep to a 1ton dually 4x4 dodge pickup, and this is the one I most often drive in snow and all other conditions. It had some cheap road tires on it and I replaced them with a slightly aggressive mud and snow tire and that made it a true 4x4 (it even has low range). Everything in the car works and it even has a 5000lb towing capacity, which I have used. Best car for the money I have ever owned hands down.

more ""rough"". There was significant 
wind noise and engine noise. Jumped 
onto the QX4, and I didn't even know 
that the car was powered by gas 
(thought it was electric). Only thing 
to improve on is the Rear-Seat Legroom

I think I test drove every SUV in the

best!

Great handling and performace.  Plenty 
of pickup and very little sway.  Tight 
cornering.  Smooth ride compared to 
its competition.  (it was smoother 
than the g35 sport).

Definitely worth the upgrade from a 
Pathfinder just for the classy front

better warrany are all more plusses

comfortable for it's passengers.  Not 
enough leg room and the door opening 
makes it hard to get in and out.  The 
QX4 has great pick up, you just touch 
the petal and you're off.  The steering 
is also very reliable and secure

Compared this with other SUV's in the 
$35+ range, best bang for the buck!
Narrowed it down with the Acura 
MDX, the QX4 gives you the things to 
make the $30K plus purchase 
worth it; one touch power open/shut 
Sunroof, same with front driver AND 
PASSENGER Windows, 6 disc in-dash CD 
changer and Xenon headlights! The 
things you don't even get with a base 
MDX and some still left off with the

I get immediate & powerful response

hesitation. I drove all the SUV's in

do the ""look back"" when walking away

Read most Edmunds reviews prior to purchase and some of the negative reviews I have not seen.  I will confirm that the DVD monitor button rattles when in use.  The back door rattles only when one hits a moderate jolt, but so far we love it.  Lots of room with four captain chairs, powerful engine.  "
infiniti,qx56,2004,Allan , 07/12/2008,Fun Ship,4,"I am sold on Infiniti.  Having driven BMWs for over 15 years I must say that as soon as I test drove the Infiniti it felt very much like a Beamer but much better.  Coming from an X5 BMW I wanted to have speed and pick up and still have a car feel to driving.  The QX56 has it all, power, comfort and the Cadillac Escalade that I test drove was no comparison.  This is an 04 with only 21,000 miles so it feels like new.  Took it on the interstate for the first time and it was like heaven. The cockpit gives one the feel of an aircraft.  Awesome job Infiniti I'm hooked!!             "
infiniti,qx56,2004,Mark Z., 02/07/2006,Still Can't Find What I'm Looking For...,4,"After a disappointing Escalade ownership experience, gave the Japanese Mfrs. a try. The QX56 won us over with their features, gizmos, and inventive seats. The test drive did not reveal some immediate issues we discovered on our fist trip: the truck rides hard, even on highway, had to reduce tire pressure to make it acceptable. The road disturbances excite the truck body which resonates the interior with an uncomfortable sound. (shoulda' used thicker steel) The overhead console rattled (had replaced). The brakes replaced 3 times - never admitted that they undersized the rotors. Temp. controls are counter-intuitive. Seats are flat w/ little side & head support - Nissan Armada's are better! "
infiniti,qx56,2004,TK62, 03/14/2004,Love It!,4,"Just bought the QX56 and I love it.  
Terrific design characteristics and 
very roomy inside.  Have yet to see 
many on the road so that makes it more 
appealing.  Looks like a big SUV but 
drives like a smaller vehicle. "
infiniti,qx56,2004,deanomeano, 04/02/2004,Infiniti QX56--- absolutely awesome!,5,"Was looking at BMW X5, Hummer, 
Escalade, and Q56.  After driving other 
3, I went to Infiniti dealership.  
Looks of this vehicle on the web cannot 
compare with the awesome looks of it in 
real life.  Phenomenal luxury with 
brute good looks.  My wife was 
overwhelmed with the features, looks 
and performance.  Obviously, it's new, 
so we'll have to see how it holds up.  
It's an Infiniti, so we're expecting a 
lot in reliability.  Makes Escalade 
look sick in comparison."
infiniti,qx56,2004,Bailey, Esq,Great Vehicle!,5,"This is my 5th SUV and 2nd Infiniti - 
it's by far the best full-sized luxury 
SUV now on the market! If you remove 
the headrests from the front seats, 
move them all the way forward and 
recline them, they form a long couch 
with the seats in the 2nd row.(My 
Infiniti QX4 also did this, and it's a 
great feature.) The QX56 offers the 
ultimate in comfort, luxury, space, 
design, and drive. Better interior than 
the Escalade, which has a dated dash 
and no back-up camera. Better seat 
configuration and legroom than the 
competitors. Also, Infiniti's service 
is great, and their warranty is a bit 
longer than that of their competitors."
infiniti,qx56,2004,OWENSSFC, 08/15/2004,LOVE THIS TRUCK,5,"I HAD A GMC DINALI FOR 3 1/2 YRS

WAS HAPPY TO SEE NISSAN PUT THIS TRUCK 
OUT THAT MET MY SIZE/TOWING NEEDS. I 
PREVIOUSLE HAD 2 PATHFINDERS WHEN I 
COULD NOT AFFORD NEW TRUCKS AND PUT 
OVER 200K ON EACH. I HAVE HADE THIS

1600MI BEACH TRIP AND TO THE LAKE. I 
TOWED MY 6500 LB BOAT WITH NO PROBLEM 
AT ALL. I ALSO TOWED MY 8000LB CAMPER 
THE 5 MILES FROM STORAGE THE TRUCK DID 
FINE AND WAS AS GOOD AT TOWING AS MY 
GMC WAS. WHILE I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS 
TRUCK A SHORT TIME I CAN ALREADY TELL 
THE BUILD IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE GMC. "

so we decided to step up into a 
differnt design. We have enjoyed this 
suv as much as the surburbans.  There 
is a lot more leg room in the middle 
row and third row of seats.  you do 
give up storage space.  Overall I would 
rate this and recommend the suv to 
everyone."
infiniti,qx56,2004,md, 01/28/2005,Surplus of horsepower,4,"I needed something that seats six comfortably.  The Sequoia, Escalade and Navigator 3rd row could not compare.  This SUV has incredible horsepower (315) and comes to a stop in a hurry.  GPS navigation is awesome (makes me feel like getting lost on purpose).  The family loves it.  The intelligent cruise control, the rear view camera, the memory seats (includes side mirrors and foot pedal adjustments) are great.  Heated seats in the driver, passenger and second row a nice touch as well.  During the cold weather months the remote start is a pleasure.  The nimble handling is almost as impressive as the acceleration (both low and midrange).  I would recommend this vehicle in a heartbeat. "
infiniti,qx56,2004,Tony Barcellona, 04/29/2006,My First Foreign auto.,4,"I love my QX56. I compared Escalde, Denali, Lexus, Toyota, Armada and others. The QX56 was by for the best equipped, best warranty and the best value at $50,000. I will trade it in for another QX56 in 2008 no matter what the price gas goes to. "
infiniti,qx56,2004,B Coombs, 03/19/2007,2004 QX 56,4,"Vehicle has performed well, and for a 2004 model, has some superior qualities, like rear view camera, and front radar that controls the vehicle speed while using cruise control. Plenty of size and comfort for any taste, it handles well in adverse Midwest weather, and for a large SUV earns respectable 16 mpg mileage. Overall I would seriously consider buying another version of this vehicle when I replace this one."
infiniti,qx56,2004,Ivette, 10/17/2004,wish I purchased foreign,3,"I fell in love with the QX56 when I
drove it and loved the way it handled so
we purchased it. I should have known
this SUV    was not a good thing when I
noticed the armrest on the second row
were unraveling.  Since then we have had
a squeak in the sunroof/DVD section that
is unbarable. It's been in the shop 3
times for that.The navigation system
stopped working after 1 1/2 months.The
back roof panel has fallen down, the
radio dial popped out above the DVD

on and there are no flat tires.The

I traded out of a Lexus LX470 into the Infiniti QX56.  In the first 20,000 miles the brakes failed 4 times.  The rotors replaced & resurfaced 3 times.  The ABS and skid control malfunction almost killing me.  It is a noisy, rough piece of junk.  Traded it today for an 07 Escalade.  WHAT A RELIEF!  The Cadillac is far superior in ride, quality, and technology.  Not to mention fuel economy.  The weird noises, parts falling off and brake failures on the QX are almost laughable.  A true GARBAGE TRUCK!"
infiniti,qx56,2004,Steve Goldberg, 12/03/2004,Why did I go with something new,2,"I got suckered into buying what I thought was a new luxury Japansese truck. I liked the exterior and the interior was not that bad to me coming from a Denali. This car shakes, rattles, rolls and I cannot believe it is no better built than my old GMC Denali. I do like the fact its very big and fast, what a nice engine. But I've been to the dealer 8 times for various quality issues in less than 6 months."

is without a doubt the most complete 
vehicle I have ever owned.  I drove all 
the competitiors (Escalade, Navigator, 
SRX) and it puts them to shame. Love the 
power and the ride.  I thought my 
Sequoia drove and road pretty good, but 
this vehicle is so much better. It 
""drives"" a lot smaller than it is.  "

drives well with minimal cabin noise 
on the freeway. Aggressive looking 
body that I really like. 17.25 feet 
long really demands attention. All 
that size doenst go for nothing, 
inside it is as if your in a limo. 
More leg room then you would imagine. 
Even the third row is comfortable for 
us big guys (im 6'6). I used to have a 
GMC Denali and the legroom in the 
third row is just not the same. The 
Navigation system is very easy to use, 
even though I dont use it alot."

Replaced door lock relay and windshield washer motor. Recalled for fire hazard from trailer light socket. Dealer refuses to fix rear window spray nozzle. Luckily able to avoid 2 crashes when brakes failed. Shakes, rattles and rolls. Drives like a tank. Steering wheel will not come back into place every time. A/C controls are terrible. Gas guzzler."
infiniti,qx56,2004,Mississippi, 09/14/2007,QX56,3,"Bought this in the first model year.  Too many small problems and a few big ones.  Several of the problems can't be fixed because they are ""not reproducible"" at the dealership."

I was initially concerned about the brakes after reading some of the early reviews, but that hasn't been an issue for me.  I've haven't had a single mechanical problem.  I would gladly purchase again."
infiniti,qx56,2004,rrsandlin, 01/10/2006,Excellent,4,The vehicle is extremely comfortable in driving and riding.  Gas mileage seems no better or worse than other SUV's previously owned.  Brakes have been the biggest problem; however I live in a very hilly part of the US.

Denali (we would have been kicking 
ourselves in the butt). We saw the 
inside of the QX56, we knew we had to 
get this vehicle. We test drove the 
vehicle and we couldn't believe how 
nice the handling was. It didn't feel 
like you're driving a HUGE SUV. It felt 
more like drving a mid-size SUV. I

them all and the QX56 was leaps and 
bounds above the rest; features, 
comfort, styling and standard 
features.  If you are looking at a new 
SUV, go drive one for yourself and you 
will be sold.  Be prepared to spend

We have owned the car for over a month

look forward to driving it and feel

intended to get a QX4, and I was very upset when 
they discontinued it.  I had no intention of going 
with such an enormous vehicle, but I love Infiniti 
and wanted to stick with them (my last vehicle was 
a 1997 I30).  Unfortunately, I think the FX's are 
about the ugliest things on the road, so I was 
considering going with another manufacturer.  I 
tried the Lincoln Aviator, the Cadillac SRX and the 
Acura MDX.  I didn't love any of them.  Then, the 
QX56 came out, and I had the chance to get 
another Infiniti that I actually liked!  Reading the 
reviews here helped me make up my mind, and I'm 
really happy I got it.  "

been awesome, but Infiniti won't stand 
behind the quality (or lack there of)

a quality (slightly larger) SUV. The 
QX56 fit the bill in size but the 
quality-stops me COLD. In 2 months, 
my catalytic converter has gone bad & 
there is a major squeak in the front 
passenger seat. The problem is that no 
one can tell me when the part will 
arrive even though it was ""ordered at 
the highest customer service level

However, I just wanted to add to every person that has already said something about the brakes.  We have also had the brakes serviced several times for rotor problems (shaking).  It's VERY ANNOYING because our dealership is one hour away and they won't pick up the vehicle to service it.  It's hard to love a car so much and have such a terrible time with the brakes.  We are considering exercising the Lemon Law because brakes are a safety issue.  Maybe Infiniti will perk up then?  The vibration in the roof is awful too.  I noticed several people are experiencing that as well."
infiniti,qx56,2004,twiliteguy, 12/01/2005,great value,4,I was looking for a large safe luxurious SUV for my family with good value and have found it in this vehicle. Comfort level is second to none in my opinion in the QX56. Gas mileage is not an issue when you buy in this class and size. There were issues with software probs in the navigation system but these were quickly rectified by my dealer. Dollar for dollar this SUV is got to be considered when purchasing in this class.
infiniti,qx56,2004,Lifesafety, 01/17/2006,AWESOME SUV. Better than my Hummer,4,"Have owned Hummer, Suburban, and custome vans. This QX 56 gets better mileage, 21 mph at 70 mph and  its features are topped by no one.Love the laser controlled cruise control. I'll never have to use my brakes again in traffic. The QX 56 does it for us"
infiniti,qx56,2004,BC, 05/28/2006,QX-56 Fun,4,"Great quality. Unique vehicle that gets great looks on the street and around the block. Great to drive, and great features explained in the next segment."
infiniti,qx56,2004,SJ, 11/16/2006,Problems with this truck,2,"The rotors were warped (thin, no good for vehicle wt.) - 3 dealer trips before they replaced it (""manuf. defect"") in all - y not issue recall? The steering never returns 2 position, the flaps on the back of 2nd row won't stay anymore (Velcro wore out after 12 mo.), cumbersome mech. 2 fold 2nd row- doesn't always work, lukewarm not heated front seats, very poor quality build, rear door auto lift problem, 2 tires wore out at 24K(cheap), space behind 3rd seat not useful like Expedition., oil change at non-dealer and screen reminder never goes away - tire pressure gauge and hand break fault - dealer had 2 fix - manuf. defect - one tire leaked air from valve, made in Japan, not true luxury vehicle."
infiniti,qx56,2004,kareem rasheed, 12/25/2006,reliability,1,"This car has lot of flaws and it is painful to pay so much money and do not get reliability. It has been in shop many times for AC, brakes, heater, door locks. The engine makes grinding noise in spite of using super unleaded fuel. "
infiniti,qx56,2004,TJA, 01/07/2007,Satisfied QX 56 customer,4,"Definitely better value/fun quotient over Escalade and Navigator, better new car price too.  This is one of those ""no brainer"" buying decisions.  After 2+ years and 45,000 miles would definitely do it again!"
infiniti,qx56,2004,rbarea, 05/28/2007,Still going strong!,4,"After 30 months of hard South Florida driving, my QX56 is still going strong! I'm averaging 15 mpg per fill-up with premium fuel. I've had no mechanical problems and the vehicles handling and brakes have allowed me to avoid several potential accidents. For the money, I can't believe that this SUV doesn't rank higher on everyone's list. Most people have not been inside a QX56 nor have they driven one but every time someone new gets inside my vehicle, it's all compliments. For those who are shopping SUVs, reward yourself and check out the value of the QX56."
infiniti,qx56,2004,r8rfan, 07/21/2007,Best SUV for the $$$$,4,"This is a luxury cruiseliner on wheels.  I have 77K on this car in 3 years because we would rather drive in this machine.  The only problem we had was they did not make the brakes powerful enough when they first produced it, but Infiniti stepped up in a big way and not only replaced the brakes, but also paid for all of my factory services for the first 30K miles in a gesture of goodwill.  They literally sent me a check for over $500.  Gotta love a company that stands behind their product.  The kids love this thing and we have taken 2-3 hour trips with this thing with 7 adults and no complaints of discomfort.  This vehicle is the ultimate in comfort.  "

I have driven several different SUV's and my choice was between this vehicle and the Cadillac Escalade. I must say that the escalade is beautiful on the outside like the Inifiniti, but the inside cannot compare. The Cadillac is not only outdated inside, but has a pimpish image and this is not what I wanted. When you say Infiniti it says class, luxury, technology and performance.  "

I spent like over 5000 big ones already on a car less than 5 years old. "

We are trying to use the lemon law to get our money back."
infiniti,qx56,2005,LBP2013, 10/16/2010,Very un-Japanese in quality!,3,This vehicle was purchased new in March 2005. My family and I had nothing but problems with this vehicle. We had many engine issues that Santa Monica Infiniti repaired many times and finally my family decided to work with an attorney since this car had so many repairs and many recurring problems and we believed it qualified for remedies through the lemon law. Through persistence and working closely with our attorney Infiniti finally had to buy the car back and give us monetary remedy. We then bought a 2007 Escalade ESV to replace this unsatisfying beast. Infiniti gave us the money in February 2008 after the lemon law buyback.
infiniti,qx56,2005,BogeyMan, 11/01/2009,75000 miles and still great!,4,"After 4 1/2 years and 75K miles, this vehicle cannot be beat.  We drive locally, long distance, in snow, heat and traffic.  We couldn't ask for a better ride, fit finish and overall reliability.  All we do are regular oil changes, tire rotations and scheduled maintenance and this truck runs great. We had an unfortunate experience hitting a VERY large deer once, and had we been in anything else, the deer would have been in our laps. We were safe, the deer escaped, and all we had to replace was the front grill and hood. Insurance covered it. Even all the toys (DVD system, Navigation, Sirius, power lift gate) remain in great working order.  We love this SUV, and the paint still shines like new!"
infiniti,qx56,2005,Fickle Buyer, 04/15/2005,Fickle No More: QX56 Loyalist,4,"Our search for the Dream family-sized SUV ended with the QX56. The size, ride, handling, ergonomics (exception: useless clock)and build quality is exceptional in this category. We blew through an Expedition EB (don't get me started), and a Sequoia Ltd (why do they STILL not have a fold- flat 3rd seat???)to get here. We ordered the bench 2nd-row: the 3rd doesn't split, requiring you to open the whole seat if you have 5 passengers in the Capt's chair option. Just took a trip w/4 people,1 dog,4 sets of clubs & luggage.Plenty roomy! Mileage on hwy fully loaded is +/- 16mpg. Range of 400 miles per tank is great. Very smooth on and off-road (mudding through a construction zone). Buy it now!"
infiniti,qx56,2005,Texas Girl08, 01/03/2008,"You've seen the good news, now the bad",3,"I loved my Q4x4 the first year I had it, but it started falling about at about 25k miles. In for repairs for failing elec system... rear liftgate won't lift (at all), tells you liftgate is open when it is not, flashes and beeps warning for flat tire when there is none, dvd is very noisy and the screen is not fastened securely. After the first year it bounces noisily, heated seats went out, driver seat lumbar broke, rear third row seat broke, nav system went out... these are highlights! Will never buy Infiniti again and selling this."
infiniti,qx56,2005,Infiniti driver, 02/12/2005,Wait for the 2006,3,"I believe Infiniti makes a good automobile.  I think because of the newness of this vehicle there are a lot of problems that need to be adjusted.  I have had 2 blow out tires.  I've had shaking when I apply brakes.  (Rotors were recalled in the middle of winter - that's scary)  Problems with Heat turning on and off, problem with seat warmer."

infiniti,qx56,2005,jlolson, 11/17/2006,2005 QX56 4X4,3,"I bought this vehicle because I LOVE my G35.  The QX is a decent ride with a powerful engine and lots of cargo room.  Seats move around easily, third row folds flat and is easily accessed.  The QX Comes equipped with cheap tires that won't stay balanced and need to be replaced for a good ride. Interior appointments are nice except for the dash which is straight out of the Armada and not up to luxury standards.  The Nav system is sub-par for a vehicle in this price range, Acura's nav is 100 times better.  With not a lot of Japanese vehicles to chose from in this size and price range it's not a bad vehicle but I don't love it like my G35."
infiniti,qx56,2005,Cronan, 03/03/2008,I would never buy Infiniti again!,2,"Coming from reliable Toyota vehicles I never thought that buying a new luxury vehicle would be such a let down. I have had over 20 issues with my QX56! From small trim pieces falling off to the brake rotors being replaced twice, the ABS system failing, transmission lines being replaced. I just picked it up yesterday for the transmission issue & today it is still gushing fluid. I am unable to park in the garage because of it. This is the worst vehicle I have owned ever! Please reconsider your Infiniti purchases...Buyer Beware!"
infiniti,qx56,2005,atorreon, 04/02/2011,very nice,3,very nice lux suv...great size and comfort. if you are looking from a great family hauler and can handle the 12mpg than choose this. the qx is loaded with several things other brands are just starting to do...a great example is the rearview camera which cadillac/gm/others dont do
infiniti,qx56,2005,qx56, 04/05/2009,LOVE MY QX56,4,I have been thrilled with this great SUV. I am a widow with 4 children and I am a Realtor. I have never had any problems with it and it out performs my former suburban. It is the best vehicle I have ever had for the Minnesota winter driving. Lots of room for hauling and lots of entertainment for the kids!
infiniti,qx56,2005,haire, 02/26/2005,beast,4,we love it. notice some noise and needs wind shield. great to drive. drove to canada our first trip right after we purchased. its really a head turner. still not many on the road.
infiniti,qx56,2005,HappyNow, 08/19/2005,Just Sold,2,"I was greatly disappointed with my QX56.  The car rattled the entire time I had it, 10 months.  The overhead console had to be replaced.  There were rattling issues with the front end.... I sold this SUV at a loss, but I was happy to get rid of it.  I wish i had read these reviews before i bought this suv.  To think i traded my lexus lx470, i wanted more room, for this big rattler."
infiniti,qx56,2005,QX56, 05/12/2005,Great Vehicle,4,"It is a very nice ride with many luxury features that are standard.  Gas mileage could be better, but for the size and engine power, it is overall a great deal.  Learning to park a car this size is a bit intimidating at first, but it is far easier than something as big as a Suburban.  "

infiniti,qx56,2005,Pumpkin PH, 08/08/2010,What a wonderful Truck,4," Most of the time, the QX56 has felt very smooth on the road and has been extremely comfortable on long hauls to Mammoth. Comfort is great, but still a body on frame truck. Roomy all around. Great 2nd row - limo- like room. Same height and width, but the extra 8"" length over the Yukon are surprisingly noticeable. The kids love it room for them, friends, and groceries. Tows like a champ, very comfortable on long trips. The 4wd system is great. No problems in 4 feet of snow or in light off-roading. Having a 4x4 lo range also sold us on this beast. After one year and 20k miles we are very happy. Currently 95k and counting."
infiniti,qx56,2005,bill r, 12/17/2004,A great SUV,4,"I checked out all the large SUV's and am a previous owner of the Lexus LX470 and Escalade EXT. The QX56 was tops  because: 1- The interior room, especially the 2nd row. 2- The seats fold flat for excellent storage and comfortable for my aging Golden Retriever. 3- The looks are attractive . 4- The rear parking camera. 5- The navagation system is far more practical and useful than On Star, plus it's free. 6-Infiniti people, corporate, called me to ask how I like it and how they could make it better. Impressive.I wanted to get another LX, but they still insist that their removeable 3rd row seats, are a good idea. Who wants to store them.I believe most people spending 70k don't have small kids. "
infiniti,qx56,2005,Paul, 12/21/2004,Best full size luxury SUV out there!,4,"I did extensive research before this purchase and I'm very pleased with the results.  The fit, finish, and comfort features are second to none.  Many of the luxury options on this vehicle are standard compared to others (Cadillac, Lincoln, Land Rover, Lexus, Denali), and you won't find as many on the road which makes it unique!  Although Nissan makes the similar Armada for about $7K less, this one has all of the bells and whistles, the engine is smooth, quiet and more powerful.  Before you go and buy an escalade or Navigator, stop by your Infiniti dealer...you'll end up with one in your garage (if it will acutally fit in it!!)"
infiniti,qx56,2005,REEM, 02/13/2005,IT CAN BE BETTER,3,"Interior noise coming from the plastic on the doors, seats comfort can be better , so they need to clean the interior plastic ,and get more comfort seat.  "
infiniti,qx56,2005,Allen Pearl, 02/13/2005,We like it a lot.,4,"This auto replaces a 2004 M45.  The M45 was very nice, but no trunk room.  This SUV fills all of our family needs, has a wonderful ride, and the handling is supburb.  All in all, the QX56 is perfect for us, and we love it.  Fuel economy is important, but not as important as all of the other features on this car.  We love it.  It's big, yes, but easy to handle."
infiniti,qx56,2005,Jeff Centers, 03/30/2005,Infiniti QX 56,4,"Vehicle is a pleasure to drive.  I own numerous German autos and this one is comparable in quality, features, and especially comfort, at half the price.  The power band is awesome, the transmission silky smooth, and the driver controls are well placed.  Brakes could be better, and it has a pretty good blind spot on the driver side but you learn to accommodate.  Overall it was a great purchase and I am proud to drive and be seen in it.  It definitely turns heads everywhere we go."
infiniti,qx56,2005,RattleSUV, 04/09/2005,RattleSUV,2,The car has had enough rattles for 20 auto.  It has been in service at least every month working on the rattle and front wheel rattle.  Would never purchase another Infiniti again after this experience.
infiniti,qx56,2005,Happy Owner, 04/10/2005,Excellent SUV QX56 4X4,4,"With 3000 miles already,my wife and I are very pleased with the vehicle. There hasn't been one trip back to the dealer for anything. The XM Satelite radio is fine, the Navigation is wonderful with the ""Birds Eye View"". The gas mileage I think could be better but 14.25 mpg is what it gets. This SUV is Powerful, no problem getting out into the thick of it. The stopping power could put you through the windshield, I had one occasion for a panic stop, (AWSOME)"
infiniti,qx56,2005,Bear, 04/13/2005,"""Big"" But Outstanding SUV",4,Overall I'm very satisfied with the big Inifiti SUV.  Edmunds is right about this beast being thirsty but I knew this when I bought it.  Very good build quality.  Very nice interior.

infiniti,qx56,2005,carl j, 04/21/2005,Too many problems,3,"This could be a great car, but when you pay $55k for a luxury auto and then have the rattles, shakes, and bad brakes it doesn't matter how nice everything else is.  I thought it would be worked out for 2005.  Now I am suffering along with the 2004 owners.  I wish I had never purchased this vehicle.  It has taken a lot of time and energy to get Infiniti to make the fixes on this thing and it is still not better.  I would rather be driving a common Tahoe or Sequoia.  I may look good on the outside but I am too embarrassed to have friends, coworkers, clients etc ride in it.  If you really want one, I advise to wait a few years and then reevaluate very conservatively or buy a 2004 for cheap."
infiniti,qx56,2005,miaschele , 05/01/2005,qx56 suv,4,"Wanted to downsize, had 4 surburbans and was leary of change. Love this car, ride is the smoothest, interior is spacious and so fun to drive.I drove all the other luxury SUV's and this car is my favorite by far and fairly priced compared to others. The lack of cargo space is hard to get use to but that is part of downsizing."
infiniti,qx56,2005,Infinitiqx56, 05/12/2005,QX56,4,I went from a 02 Escalade to this.  I like 80% of the style and features of the Qx56 better.  There are a few little things I do miss like the doors do not lock automatic when you shift into gear.  Also I am a big fan of the heated seats and the Qx56 do not get hot enough.  I miss the power folding mirrors for parking in tight spots.  Over all I like the Qx56 better though.  The power lift gate is very cool.  Also the third row seat is way better and it folds flat.  If any one is in the market for a luxury suv then I would recommend this one for sure.  One other note the 4 year 60k mile warrany were also a deciding factor for me.  Hope this helps someone out there.   
infiniti,qx56,2005,DUBAI, 05/16/2005,Good Value,4,Great car to have. I have switched from FX45 to the Q56. The only set back is the Quality of the material used in the interior!! i wish if it was like the lexus! Performance is great!!! i cant wait fo the after market parts!! 0-60 is faster that the Range Rover and the X5 4.4!!!  I would recommend this car for every one!!
infiniti,qx56,2005,Larry Foles, 05/28/2005,"Shake, Rattle and Rattle",3,"This car has a great drive train but rides rough, rattles and the wheels vibrate like crazy. The dealership says it was design so tight that you will feel more of the road. If the road is not a good road then you will feel it in the steering wheel. I'm trying to get them to satisfy me but not getting anywhere. This car needs work."
infiniti,qx56,2005,Harry, 07/10/2005,Fun to drive,4,"We now have 6500 miles on this vehicle, although we have to stop more often for gas, I wouldn't trade this vehicle for any that I have purchased in the past. Since 1969 I have purchased at least 28 new vehicles, not including motorcycles and some trucks. Fun to drive, very quiet, excellent radio. Don't like where the clock is, but who cares about the time when you are driving this unit."
infiniti,qx56,2005,ed klee, 07/26/2005,Driver and Vehicle Become One,4,The instrument panel is very attractive with out effecting the need for being functonal. Instrumentation did not leave me wanting! The comfort of the seats and color co-ordination with the hardwear; first class. they just did'nt miss a beat from the rear view monitor to the navigation system and ever thing in between.I would like to know what if anything they left out. The exterior is a combination of the look of power and style just what i was looking for in an suv. Under the hood total power and acceleration more than I can use.
infiniti,qx56,2005,Lopez, 07/26/2005,Bigger is Better,4,A/C could be stronger at the beginning.  But does fine once vehicle has driven for a short period.  Only item I would change inside is split third row seats.  Everything else is excellent!  So far so good only 700 miles.  Happier now then with my Lexus RX 330!
infiniti,qx56,2005,Julie, 08/16/2005,Best for the $$$$,4,"After shopping All SUVs this was the on for me. I have owned the Mercedes ML, and the Lincoln Navigator, for interior plushness and utility this QX56 is far superior. The easy tumble mid seats and the fold flat rear third row is better than the Escalade. You can remove the mid-seat console for even more ease to the third row. "
infiniti,qx56,2005,David, 08/29/2005,Disappointed,2,"I own a Chevy and a Mecedes Benz. When I bought the QX-56, I thought I would be treated with the same intensity as I am with the Benz. Instead, I feel like I bought a Chevy. The truck, although pricey, is a terrible driving truck. Its balloon tires bounce down the road and the steering wheel jumps out of my hand over rougher road surfaces. Its dashboard is the most cumbersome I have ever come across. It is noisy and has many rattles. It only has 8,000 miles. I had problems with the front brakes at 3,000 miles. The dealer knew about it. The rotars were warped. They cut them instead of replacing. A Chevy dealer would cut. A benz dealer would replace"
infiniti,qx56,2005,Karen Walker, 01/04/2006,I love it!,5,It's a great vehicle!  Has all the bells and whistles that I love!  Great around town or on long drives.  My kids are entertained with the DVD system and we love the Bose stereo sound.

The noise is so intense that I can not enjoy the true fun of driving this vehicle. In addition the drivers seat offers very little support,it seems to cavein rather than support.Since I took ownership I have had to have the rotors cut on three different occasions. In short, as for quality, this vehicle leaves a lot to be desired. "

I really wanted a Lexus but there was just something about the Lexus that seemed like it was 5 years behiond the times, even the GX.  Someone told me to try the Infinity Q56.  It's a luxury liner.  All the luxury and comfort of a Lexus and then some, and then the brute power to pull anything and go pretty much anywhere.  "
infiniti,qx56,2005,LC, 01/06/2005,kudos,4,"The QX 56 has taken us by surprise. We previously had suburbans and lincolns and this vehicle beats both hands down.It lacks the rear space of the suburban, but has enough room. The smoothness, handly and quality are above and beyond what we expected. great car for the price. We looked at Sequioas and the interior space was not as nice as the infiniti. A great family SUV. Highly recommended. "

It is something all cars should have.  Around town gas mileage is a little slim, but road milage is fine. Liked the way the rear two rows of seats fold away.  Having owned three Lexuses before this purchase, I'm very impressed with Infiniti.  This car is bigger than the Lexus 470 and is better quality than the Cadillac Escalade  "

The Chevy needed repairs so many times, the service manager & I became best friends. Finally dumped the lousy Chevy for a QX56. Couldnt be happier! $45K for the Chevy. $48K fully loaded for the QX56 and the difference in the Infititi's quality, fit & finish is LIGHT YEARS ahead of the Chevy. Best was the QX has more power, towing, options & feels like a truck that will last. The QX56 has it all & puts away the competition for the price. I checked the Escalade & was $15K more than the QX56 with the same options. Escalade is a dressed up (YUK)Tahoe! QX56 ROCKS!!"

Couldnt be happier! $45K for the Chevy. $48K fully loaded for the QX56 and the difference in the Infititi's quality, fit & finish is LIGHT YEARS ahead of the Chevy. Best was the QX has more power, towing, options & feels like a truck that will last. The QX56 has it all & puts away the competition for the price. I checked the Escalade & was $15K more than the QX56 with the same options. Escalade is a dressed up (YUK)Tahoe! QX56 ROCKS!!"
infiniti,qx56,2005,DJ, 02/05/2005,The QX56 is fine,4,"I read some mixed reviews before going to the dealership and test driving the QX56 for myself. Funny how the Nissan Armada gets consistently high reviews and the QX gets a hard time from the MSN car reviewer expert when the QX and Armada are sisters with the same engine and body but the QX has a quieter ride with all the luxury carpet and leather. Plus, the QX costs 10-25K less than other luxury competetion. It is most comfortable and has awesome power w/the best towing capability of any SUV. Love the interior and styling is fine, much better than the square SUVs that look so generic regardless of what badge is stuck on them.    "
infiniti,qx56,2005,Lorelei Krieger, 02/05/2005,"Ice, Snow, Sleet Can't Stop Me!",4,"Having lived in Chicago for most of my life, I was thrilled with the promise of milder winters. Memphians love to bragg about their lack of winter-like weather, and I was more than willing to experience this first-hand.  Chicago can be brutal. Even so, knowing that owning a powerful Suv equipped to handle the worst road conditions was not necessary here in the sunny south, it was love at first site. My first road trip was to Florida, and she performed beautifully.  So what if she never had to prove herself in two feet of snow.  Well, God decided to answer some ones prayer for a white Christmas in Memphis. Two days before, it started out with sleety rain that soon turned in"
infiniti,qx56,2005,robbmickey, 02/05/2005,Great Car,4,"Bought this car for my wife and we have both loved it.  Looked at the Escalade, Denali, Land Cruiser, etc. and picked the QX45. Interior is very roomy and can actually fit 8 adults (although getting into the back seat takes a little work).  The car has quite a bit of power and rides smoothly. Great in dash 6 disk changer and sound system.  Definitely a family car as it is a big vehicle."

We have had sports cars and traded in a Volvo convertible (C-70) Now my wife says it's her turn to run them off the road! If you can afford the premium fuel and don't mind if a K&N filter doesn't add to the lowly 12 miles per gallon this is THE vehicle for you !!!

This thing is HUGE, but drives like a much smaller vechile. We pondered over this or the Denali, and I'm glad of the decision. This rides better, looks better and runs better, and I'm a Chevy man from way back."

infiniti,qx56,2005,Jason P, 04/24/2005,"Great leg room, but....",4,"We have owned the QX56 for about three weeks. It offers lots of leg room for passengers. I wish the front passenger seat was offered with 10 way adjustments and was a tad bit more comfortable. The storage behind the third row is VERY disappointing. We were forced to place our luggage in the third row, next to our son, on our first long trip. Infiniti should consider splitting the third row bench seat to accomodate luggage and at least one third row passenger. All-in- all, my wife and I prefer the QX56 over all of the other SUV models we tested. If you are looking for 8 passenger room, you should strongly consider this model; however, beware of the limited storage space!!!"

It has been to dealership 4 times still NO FIX. Dealer is a nice team but they cannot rebuild the whole car. Now less than a year new AC broke, Breaks are gone, Back spoiler broke and flew on Highway  If you love engine, wait 'til it starts giving you a hissing snake noise. DVD/TV interrupt with Audio. Remote on TV does not work. I have lost my patience and  ***PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT NO Matter which couple of things you may like in this vehicle **** OR wait till Infinity fixes it all  Do not be impressed by NEW Buyers Comments, They do not know what they got into.."
infiniti,qx56,2005,Diana, 07/04/2005,Dont buy a QX56!!!,3,I bought my QX56 12/04 and it has been in the shop 8 times for rattling from the headliner!! 3 times for brake repairs and I only have 7K miles on this thing!! The dealership is worthless and I am frustrated. Its not fun driving a car that has the most awful squeak/rattle coming from above constantly!  Even my 2 small kids and the radio cant drown out that noise! It has also been in for the gear shifter sticking twice.  Please think twice about this vehicle....its not worth it!
infiniti,qx56,2005,Jon R, 07/06/2005,QX56 Owner for over a year,3,"Many mechanical issues.  Replaced front brake rotors and pads 4 times.  Infiniti knows of brake shutter problems and finally found a fix.  Both front driver and passanger window motors had to be replaced as windows would not roll up properly.  Interior plastic scratches very easily.  If you have kids....expect the interior to get all beat up looking and scratched.  The cruise control sensor will not function if the sensor gets any dirt and water on it....so forget about using in the rain.  We use in the snow during the winter and the 4X4 stability is poor due to heavy weight difference toward the rear.  On a positive note, the service dept is excellent.  I would not recommend."
infiniti,qx56,2005,APearl, 07/16/2005,Love this car,4,"Except for the rear door catching part of the edge of the front door, in certain instances, the car is a dream to drive, and own.  Comfort, style and the feeling of being safe on the road is built into this car. Can't wait to take it on a long trip.  Expect to take it north in August, and give it a good run on the road."
infiniti,qx56,2005,Steven ZoBell, 07/16/2005,"Great looks, sounds like a Taxi",3,"We were looking at several vehicles and fell in love with the styling of the QX56.  Love the ride, interior and power.  However the vehicle has been in over 10 times in the past 8 months for anything from many large rattles & squeaks, new brake system to having to repaint door molding and roof rack.  Just today - the same center console rattle that we have had it in for 4 times started again.  This is not a subtle rattle, but a loud one that wakes small children."
infiniti,qx56,2005,Tommy, 07/17/2005,The Fortress,4," I bought this vehicle last year and I love it. Sure the gas mileage isn't that great, but if you spend that much money on a vehicle and all you do is worry about the gas mileage then maybe you shouldn't buy one. The power is unbelievable for an SUV of this size. I highly recommend the QX56.   "
infiniti,qx56,2005,Shawn, 07/18/2005,Better Quality than a Chevrolet / GMC,4,"Thus far the ride, craftmanship and luxury features are better than the 2001 Suburban and 2004 GMC Yukon XL that I previously owned.  We are really enjoying the QX56."

I strongly recommend all Q56 owners have their brakes check. The dealer has not been able to get rid of all the rattles. At two miles hour bumpers will sustain damage upon hitting object. Dealer did not imfom me that I needed to use premium gas until after I purchase the Q56.             "
infiniti,qx56,2005,Chris, 08/19/2005,Rattle Box with Bad Brakes!,2,"This car has been a real disappointment.  We love the look of the car and the overall comfort of the interior.  BUT, We have had it in for service 4 times now, they charge us almost $600 each time for service, and with 20,000 miles they have had to fix the brakes 3 times, the dealer has even admitted that there is a brake problem with these cars and they do not know how to fix it except to keep replacing them every 5000 miles or so.  The interior console that houses the fold up tv screen rattles like crazy, the automatic opening backdoor has had to been fixed twice. After having this car for 1.5 years I have had enough. I dont feel safe with these brakes and a 13 month child. Don't buy it"

Since 4/05, when we bought it new, we have had the brakes replaced, the rotors replaced, and more work done to the electrical system (on several occassions).  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone."

The second row legroom is comparable to an airplane seat in first class.  The Navigation is system is the easiest one I've used to date.  The truck has phenomenal pickup and has an unbelievably small turning radius for it's size. Parking's a breeze with the rear view camera and beeping alert. The interior is luxurious, yet understated.  There is nothing ""over- the-top"" or flashy about this vehicle unlike many of it's comparable counterparts on the road today.    "
infiniti,qx56,2005,Bill, 01/16/2006,Bill,4,"The QX56 has all the others beat by a mile!  Runs great, looks great, holds 8 people comfortably, or hauls 4x8 shhets of plywood.  You name it.  Easy seat conversion too.  I most like (and have never seen) the Q's ability have a person sit in the second row, and NOT have his knees touch the seat in front. The best, (and best value for the money) auto, I've ever owned!  Very satisfied!"

I have taken three long round trips 1,600 or more; and it was a pleasure to drive. I averaged close to 16 miles on the trips. City mileage is about 14.3 miles to the gallon. "
infiniti,qx56,2005,Jim Heine, 02/19/2006,Problems with QX56,3,"The road performance is fine.  The shortfall lies in the dash- poor heating and defroster times, too complicated to find proper settings for climate controls.  Have had several minor breakdowns with basic functions ie windshield wipers,mirror motors. Probably would not buy again- I'm a 3X infinity buyer."
infiniti,qx56,2005,WeBHappy, 08/01/2006,So far Soo Good!!,4,We loved this vehicle from the first test drive. Rented a 2004 for extended test drive and it was terrible!! Brakes felt like we were driving on cobblestones. Took a chance and bought a 2005. We love it and have not had any problems. No other large SUV handles like this. Beats my Q45!!
infiniti,qx56,2005,Tim, 09/23/2006,Great vehicle; Smooth.....but jittery,3,"We owned a Yukon and considered the Escalade and LX450 when we bought the QX56. While the overall vehicle has been very good, and the ride also very good, it still has some jitters and noise on the highway that were not experienced in the other vehicles. Most of the time, the QX56 has felt very smooth on the road and has been extremely comfortable on long hauls to Mammoth. Comfort is great, but at times the ride and feel on the freeway can feel a bit jittery and truck-like inferior to the ride we experienced with the Yukon,or the other cars we drove. Roomy all around. Great 2nd row - limo- like room. Same height and width, but the extra 8"" length over the Yukon are surprisingly noticeable."

infiniti,qx56,2006,Penny, 01/15/2009,My lease is expiring- - here's my story,3,"My lease expires next week so I thought I would summarize the pros and cons of my experience with the QX56.  I have had it for over three years and it has almost 45K miles on it.  Overall I have enjoyed the power, quiet, and handling.  The kids have enjoyed all the leg room, the captain's chairs and DVD in the back.  Cargo capacity is great.  The biggest problem I have with it is the suspension- -the car booms and shudders with even small potholes.  Second biggest problem is occasional glitch with brakes that dealer told me they had never heard of but has happened with other owners.  (suddenly makes a loud clunking sound and gets jerky upon rebraking- -must restart car.)  Actual mileage: 13."

Yet it was really comfortable and absolutely great to drive on the highway.  After a year and a half, I traded it in on a 2006 model, and I've been extremely happy in every respect with the new model.  Obviously, early manufacturing problems and quality control issues have been resolved based on my experience.   My dealer experience, although limited to scheduled maintenance visits, has been superb.   The '06 QX56 is great on the road--powerful and comfortable.  The interior is very well done.  Gas mileage on the road is inverse to my speed.  At 70 mph, I get 19.2-19.5 mpg.  "

Driving this car though, has always been a challenge.
I have had constant alignment and suspension problems and the brakes...oh the brakes.
This super heavy truck warps brakes yearly!!!
I am on a final set hopefully, slotted and drilled but wish I didn't have to go aftermarket!
You would think Infiniti would have matched their rotors to the weight of the car!!
Questioning getting another although I love the styling."
infiniti,qx56,2006,pnad, 09/28/2015,Good used luxury SUV,5,"I wanted big and comfortable.  Shopped Lexus, Cadillac and Lincoln.  The QX56 was cheaper than the Escalade, bigger than the GX470 and more reliable than the Navigator.  It is a little odd looking from the outside, but looks great from the drivers seat.  And oh what a drivers seat it is...  Its like wearing new shoes WITH new socks.  So comfortable.  Passengers LOVE the second row seats.  The 3rd row, like most, is better suited to smaller kids but I could sit back there for a 30 minute ride.  Bose stereo sounds awesome. AUX input is strangely missing, but you can connect a phone/ipod whatever to the DVD input.

Mileage isn't great, but it is the same for most of these trucks.  Read up about brake issues on these trucks.  Same for Nissan Titan and Armada.  Warped rotors are not a big deal to me.  $56ea at the local part store, I don't care if I need to replace them once a year.  The other brake issue is the 'delta stroke sensor'.  You will want to google that.  A sensor goes bad in the brake booster causing the antilock brakes to kick on.  Feels like you are trying to stop on ice.  I knew it was a possibility so I wasn't freaked out when it happened to me.  Truck still stopped pretty good, just had that grindy/vibrating pedal feel.  You can clear the fault by simply restarting the vehicle.  If it happens a few more times I will look into replacing the brake booster ($180)

infiniti,qx56,2006,Butch, 07/18/2008,Great towing - awesome truck,4,"After researching over a year comparing Navigators, Yukons, Sequoias and others we are VERY happy we chose the QX56. We just returned from Lake Powell towing 10 hours each way, the QX made the trip seem easy.  Lots of torque for towing, no problem pulling a 3,000 lb boat up long grades using AC in 115 degree heat.  The load leveling worked superb!  It's very quiet and comfortable and fun to drive, handles almost as good as my BMW 740.    I read a lot of reviews and felt confused by the contrast of those who love and hate this truck - glad we took the chance because we love it.  If you tow it is a good choice with load leveling and tow mode shifting."

It handles well, rides well and has torque to spare when you hit the pedal getting into traffic.  Very roomy and comfortable we have the dual entertainment screens for the kidss in the seat backs....a blessing.  Tires and Rims look great and the body style stands out..  I have owned Yukon's, Jeeps, and the odd pickup and I can honestly say this QX56 is a winner. We looked at an Escalade and it was just an overexpensive Yukon with plastic wood glued onto the same Yukon stuff. Even the seats were the same...for 65K???  QX56 get one....you will be very happy."
infiniti,qx56,2006,Katie, 08/13/2007,Unreliable,3,I am very unhappy with this car.  First the brakes are recalled and then the hatchback broke on the day we needed to pack for camping.  The electrical goes out randomly.  The car thinks the emergency brake is on when it isn't and it then skids when I come to a stop.  I feel very unsafe driving it.  I do love how big it is.  I do love the DVD for the kids.  I love the automatic lift for the hatchback.  The navigation screen is totally useless.  I love the back up camera.  I will not be able to buy another car without it.  We are breaking our lease early to get rid of this car.

We enjoyed our 2004, even though some people had problems.  We, truthfully, never had a bit of trouble with our car.  The new Q is 4 wheel drive, and has many added features we did not have in the 2006.  Most important to my family is our safety, and we feel safe with this car.  Reliability is in the head of the owner.  We never had problems with the car, and found it to be very reliable.  We are willing to sacrifice fuel for safety, and comfort, and this is why we own the new QX56.  Truly a great allaround vehicle, for us. Allen Pearl"

Drove the Lexus, Lincoln, Escalade, Hummer, and the QX56 won me over. The first speed bump I drove over shocked me because I barely felt it.  I was so dissapointed in the interior of the Lincoln. Cheap cover over the GPS lost it for me. Lexus 3rd row folding against the side taking up space. If you are enviro sensitive, look at the amount of emissions put out by the Infinity vs. competitors."

We purchased the QX for my wife and 3 small kids while I will now drive the Lexus LX that previously was the wife's.  I have to say, that is looks like any of the issues with the car in 04/05 have been fixed now.  The truck is quiet (will never be as silent as a car), solidly built and has the BEST features.  I was ready to buy a new LX, but opted for the styling of the QX and frankly a lot more room too!  I hate that the Lexus seats fold up against the windows in my LX - but this is no problem in the QX.

We loved the 2004, and had no problems with it, now even the brskes.  The deal we were offered on the new Q was the best deal we had ever had on any vehicle, and grabbed the new car.  Very happy with the car,and all of it's new refinements.  We have found that the price of fuel is of no consequence where safety is involved.  We feel safe with the car, love to drive it, and enjoy all the stares from people on the road.  Nice job, Nisan, this is our 5th Infiniti since 1998.  We are customers for ever."
infiniti,qx56,2006,Steve, 10/01/2005,Excellent!!!!,4,By far the best in its class.  I have had my QX for 6 weeks and am so happy with my decision.  I was in a car accident and wasn't even hurt.  One of the other cars in the accident was totaled.  I did not even have whiplash.  Extremely safe...great if you have kids or you like to look cool.  Get the sunroof.  Navigation is simple.  Stock radio is amazing.  Could use a better A/C system.  Heated seats are not that hot.
infiniti,qx56,2006,pubsmeister, 01/15/2006,"so far, so good",4,"After one month, no problems. A clear upgrade from our suburban. Great power, solid suspension, firm brakes. Around town we remove the second row center console- that way the kids can get to the third row without flipping seats (nice when there are car seats or boosters in the second row). Biggest problems are with telematics. Bluetooth implementation is simplistic with poor voice recognition. I absolutely hate how the nav system is crippled when driving (it's an SUV, the front seat passenger can enter commands). It makes the idrive in our BMW look even more awesome."
infiniti,qx56,2006,Lauren, 01/17/2006,Can't find anything I don't like,4,"After looking at the Lexus, Cadilac and GMC SUV trucks I ended the search at Infinity. It has been the best decision I have ever made, and I put 150,000 miles on my Chev suburban. The drive of the QX is quite, smooth and luxurious. I have not had any problems with the mechanics or finishes of the inside or out. The GPS is very user friendly, the sound system wonderful. Working with Infinity has been very easy and their system of loaner cars makes normal maintenance a breeze. The seats are so easy to manuver and the configuations give you alot of flexability. Gas mileage is the only drawback. "
infiniti,qx56,2006,Larry, 03/07/2006,Best Large SUV Available,5,"Superb handling and ride. By far the best.  Interior comfort is very good especially for a 6' 2"" person.  Rear seats have lots of room with heaters and removable center console for easier entry to 3rd. row seats.  My wife loves her QX56.  After 12 SUV's this is the best. Very Good Dealer Service"
infiniti,qx56,2006,Me, 09/16/2006,Fantastic experience,5,Everything is so good with this vehicle. I have zero complaints. Would buy another one.
infiniti,qx56,2006,rhino2000, 10/11/2006,Picked over Mercedes,4,"My wife and I were sold on the Mercedes GL-450 until she drove the QX56.  Not only was the hype of a Mercedes false, but the QX56 was superior. We only wish they offered the Intelligent Key allowing entry wihtout pressing any buttons.  Power folding seats would also be nice.  Howevver; these features are not worth the $20k difference of the Mercedes.  We are so happy we chose this vehicle over the Mercedes.  If you are in the market for a large SUV, you MUST drive this one!  Also, the Infiniti service is second to none.  "
infiniti,qx56,2006,Sarah, 10/13/2006,Best SUV I've owned,4,"I just for the QX56 two weeks ago and it is a joy to drive.  After driving a QX4 and a Toyota 4Runner, both of which were fine, the QX56 is the car I've waited for.  The ride is smooth and firm for such a big vehicle. I love the power of the V8 and the fact that I can take just about anything (and anyone) wherever I need to go.  With only one child and one dog, my husband thinks I'm nuts to drive such a big SUV, but I love how safe I feel.  This is the 4th Infiniti we've owned and we can't imagine buying any other brand of car."
infiniti,qx56,2006,Kelley, 10/14/2006,Better SUV,4,"My wife and I were about to purchase the Mercedes GL450 when she stopped in to drive the QX56.  The truck is a great mix between comfort and braun.  It sounds like a truck, rides like a car, and hauls everything.  It also has all of the bells and whistles of the 21st century.  Bluetooth, Navi, great seats, large buttons, and a jammin' stereo!  The style was a little different, but once you drive it you see the truck in a whole different light!"
infiniti,qx56,2006,Gary Duenas, 06/10/2006,Best SUV Ever!,4,"My Wife had a Choice of Any type of SUV out there but liked the Nissan Armada.  We both saw a QX56 & said that's it!  Not knowing it was the same SUV.  We Love the Body style, Interior, GPS, Bose system, backup camera & audible warning, easy lifting 2nd row seats, DVD entertainment (added another Headrest DVD system), didn't include Tow Package but decided later not to add one because it Cheapens the look of the vehicle, added 22"" Customs Wheels w/Low profile tires, Cold Air Intake and Exhaust system (MagnaFlow) for Fuel efficiency.  Only problem that we inccured are that the Sunroof's plastic bracket comes off a lot, Air condition controls and all Passengers windows sometimes doesn't work."
infiniti,qx56,2006,Lemon, 07/03/2006,Lemon,2,"After reading all the other reviews i'm starting to belive that i was just sold a lemon. My driver's seat is comfortable although the other 6 are not. In the Winter i cannot get into the car because my handles become frozen shut (From Long Island - not cold temps). This Suv is absolutely top 5 for fuel guzzlers. Also, the wood pieces fall out of the doors when you close it. Like most other SUV's  when opening the windows it's like taking off in a plane (these windows are by far the worst at of all the suvs in its class). "
infiniti,qx56,2006,Paul m, 04/15/2006,Comfy Cabin,3,"The QX56 has great off the line power. The front seats are extremely comfortable. The ride is smooth. There were a lot of things that needed to be repaired because of poor workmanship at the 3,750 mile checkup. Middle seat cupholders are in a bad place and have been broken twice when stepped on in the dark. With everything working well this car is great if you have kids!"
infiniti,qx56,2006,Emma, 12/14/2005,Waiting to Exhale...,4,I've been looking for a luxury SUV for quite some time.  I did'nt want to be like the rest.  I saw an ad for the QX56.  I immediately had to go see it!  I called my husband and we went to go test drive the suv.  It didnt even ride like an suv.  Comming out from a Tahoe to a QX56 was a HUGE change.  This drives like a lux car.  I know we'll look to buy a small car to add to our addition for my husband.  We're in love with the Infinities!  All of them.  All the safty features are there.  We have 2 kids and I feel very secure with the added security.  Our kids will have Infinities to drive off to college (station wagon).  I can finally exhale.
infiniti,qx56,2006,J. Ur, 01/01/2006,Excellent,4,"The vehicle has been an amazing experience.  The ride is exceptional, with power to spare.  Comfort level is high and quality is what you would expect from an Infiniti. Get numerous compliments from strangers. Only complaint is the temperature controls are confusing and the A/C gets turn on unknowingly."
infiniti,qx56,2006,L Crosthwaite, 01/10/2006,My 12th SUV and the best yet,4,"After comparing other SUV's in this class, It was a easy choice.  Each of the competitors have some features that are good, but, Infiniti QX56 has the most features of all others for the price.  Power is great.  Ride and handling are very good.  The interior is comfortable and good looking.  You feel very safe in this vehicle. My Wife said she could be happy with others, but she would be real happy with the QX56. She loves her QX56"
infiniti,qx56,2006,AMEDESU, 11/12/2005,This one stands out from the rest,4,"I didn't know too much about the infinitis.  Then, i started seeing commercials, ads, and some around town.  I was over the ""sporty"" suv look.  I wanted something classy and different.  I looked into the infinity qx56 and i fell in love with it.  I loved it so much that i had all the extras that you can imagine put on for me.. 22""Rims, 2 part grill, 3 tv's.  I went for it!  I get double takes on my car all the time and compliments on it!  Infinity of montclair dealership team was great!  Thank you for buying my car of my dreams honey!   Dr. Michael & emma lawrence"
infiniti,qx56,2006,HDSCREAGLE, 11/15/2005,Northwest QX-er,4,"We drive in the Pacific Northwest and this BIG Urban Assault Vehicle definitely comes in handy in our fickle weather. It also provides a high degree of safety on our busy freeways. This is my wife's vehicle and she loves it.  You ride HIGH and safe, comfy in the leather surroundings. Controls are very intuitive and easy to use. We enjoy the automatic rear hatch, the back-up TV, nav system and the stereo is high-end too. "
infiniti,qx56,2006,Gary Mann, 11/23/2005,Great SUV,4,"I just leased 05 QX56 AWD last week. I love this SUV and all the features on it. I paid $50,300 for full loaded and money factor on my lease was .00136 for 39 months. "
infiniti,qx56,2006,jtcz06, 12/20/2005,2006 QX56,4,"My daily driver is a 04 Corvette Z06, however I look for reasons to drive the QX56!! I also have a 01 Denali, the QX is so much more of a comfort to drive. We love this truck!!!!"
infiniti,qx56,2006,Yolanda, 04/17/2006,I Love My Car,4,"So far it has been great! This is my first Infiniti QX56, previous 2 SUVs were Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition.  Have also driven an Escalade much.  Not the get up and go power of the Escalade but a close second.  More comfortable than the Escalade or my previous SUV's.  Great construction--sturdy, Navigator moldings didn't hold up well to my 3 girls and their numerous friends pilled into ""mom's taxi."" Did have an immediate gear shift problem within  hours of receiving the new car, fixed within 24 hours at the dealer. Gear was slipping out of drive and brakes locking up until motor turned off (not good in traffic)--no problems since first day.  Love the look, size, engine power."
infiniti,qx56,2006,David Hart, 04/29/2006,QX56,4,so far the qx56 has held up to it promise it drives like a luxury car but has the power of a SUV another great feature is that the back seats are heated and enough room for a 6ft to seat very comfortable in the back seat not to mention all the air bags that come with the car even on the 3rd row. overall this rates 9.3 out of 10
infiniti,qx56,2006,Allen Pearl, 05/17/2006,A very nice safe driving vechicle,4,"My wife and I bought a 2004 QX56, s wheel drive 18 months ago.  We have enjoyed the car, and the service offered to us.  Unlike some owners of that year and model, we have had no trouble with the brakes, or the car.  We were invited to look at the 2006, and because we were loyal owners of the 2004 QX56, and several other Infiniti products over the years, we were made a deal that we could not refuse.  We feel safe in the car, and we feel that we owe this safety to our family.  Fuel, the way it is, was a factor, but you cannot put a price on your life.  It was a pleasure to deal with Schumacher again, even though our old standby salesman has left the deaalership.  They treated us like kings."
infiniti,qx56,2006,NCLUDE, 05/31/2006,No Regrets,4,"I was looking for a nice, comfortable car (Lexus ES350 or Infiniti G35) and ended up getting the QX56 for its great ride and ability to hold our family of 6.  Compared to others in its class, the QX56 is the overall champion IMHO. Great ride, looks tough, lots of standard equipment and the price is great compared to others (Escalade and Navigator).  I considered the 2007 Escalade but by the time you added on the option it topped 62k.  You get much more vehicle for the money with the QX56 and also, not everyone else has one. For those trying to decide among full-size luxury SUVs, I don't think there's a better deal out there. In the end, you just have to drive one, then you'll have no doubt."
infiniti,qx56,2006,George, 09/10/2006,The best of my four SUV'S,4,"Great SUV and fun to drive, very luxurious with a lot of features. The best of the four SUV's that I currently own. (Sequioa LTD, 4runner LTD and a 4runner sport)"
infiniti,qx56,2006,Yoyo, 09/24/2006,Great Vehicle,4,"Great vehicle to drive, obviously a great drive as it is an Infiniti.  Well made with great power and amenities."
infiniti,qx56,2006,Luz , 09/28/2006,I'm in love!,4,"I got the Infiniti QX56 - 4WD from my husband as a gift.  I drove a Lincoln Towncar before I got my Infiniti.  But I just feel in love with the QX56.  I love the style, the power, the features and the head turning this vehicle gives. This is the first time I own and drive an SUV and I love it.  The price is excellent for all the features this great car has to offer!!!"
infiniti,qx56,2006,Shugrady, 10/05/2006,Love this SUV,4,"I just got my QX56 5 days ago and I'm so happy.  I traded in a 2001 QX4 that served us well. We decided to make the leap to a BIG SUV and it was the absolute right thing to do. It's fun to drive, there's tons of room for everything (and everyone), and it looks great. My husband thinks I'm nuts to want to drive such a big car, but it makes me feel extremely safe, plus it drives like a luxury car, not a big SUV. This is our 4th Infiniti and we are customers for life."
infiniti,qx56,2006,OL, 10/09/2006,Best SUV Out There,4,The title speaks for itself.  I bought the QX56 for my lead-footed wife and she loves it so much she may just keep it (unlike the other 3 SUV's in the last 5 years).  She has not one single complaint.  Maybe I'll surprise her and buy her a new one if there is a re- design.
infiniti,qx56,2006,karen, 03/01/2007,QX 56,4,The only problem I see with my qx56 is the wobbly handling when hitting a bump
infiniti,qx56,2006,Anne, 11/18/2020,Husband wouldn't dare sell my QX56!,5,"We've owned 'em all - Broncos, Expeditions, Tahoes, Suburbans, Yukons and Yukon XL Denalis, plus your usual assortment of 4x4 pick up trucks, but our favorite SUV is 
our current 2006 QX56. Traded a 2004 QX56 for the current one and although my husband wants a new one (has wanted a new one)  I refuse to part with this one.  He drives a GMC 4x4 so I consider the QX56 to be mine! My husband is 10"" taller than I am so it's always been hard finding a vehicle we're both comfortable with.  This truck allows us both to get comfortable with the seats, adjustable pedals, and steering wheel.  Although this vehicle is almost 15 years old, it still has many of the creature comforts and safety features that many vehicles still offer as options.  The only thing it doesn't have is the blind spot warning system but I understand that can be installed for less than $100 as an aftermarket.  Considering how big the vehicle is, it's so easy to drive, very secure on the road and has great visibility and no blind spots. We live in the North so I do a lot of driving in the snow and this truck is like a tank.  I have yet to feel nervous regardless of the road conditions; I am very confident that I will get to my destination safely.  I also like the fact that the truck sits up high so I can see traffic conditions ahead of me yet it's easy to get in and out of.  I've told him that since we won't get a lot for a trade in, why don't we just keep it and then he can buy the new one he wants. . . . Sounds a plan to me!
"
infiniti,qx56,2007,LastOneUp, 12/11/2006,Awesome,4,"This is a fantastic SUV. The ride is very smooth for such a large car and the power is incredible. The interior of the car is plush, big leather seats, entertainment system, GPS, awesome gauge layout, everything you could want. By far the best car I have ever owned. If you want luxury, size, power, and looks this is the car."
infiniti,qx56,2007,Dee, 04/01/2009,Love this Car,4,"I am in love with this vehicle. It's comfortable, stylish and so much fun to drive. Plus I feel like a million bucks every time I drive it because it feels like luxury. Besides, it also performs very well and runs like a dream."
infiniti,qx56,2007,scott, 01/30/2007,happy qx56 owner,4,This is a great vehicle.  we drove the new  denali and it rode great but the interior features of this vehicle blow the denali away.  we have been extremely pleased so far!
infiniti,qx56,2007,RODO, 12/24/2009,Much Better Than Expected,4,"I inherited this 4WD Beast when my Mother passed away. Not the SUV I would have purchased, but I am overly impressed. We named it the QE2, a great road vehicle, solid as a rock, very comfortable, 18mpg and my Suburban does NO BETTER, and NOWHERE NEAR the truck this one is. QUALITY ALL THE WAY. I highly recommend this truck."
infiniti,qx56,2007,nanny, 03/15/2007,Love it!,4,I purchased my vehicle in Jan 07 and have 3700 miles on it.  This car is a dream to drive.  I had driven a van or suburban for 25 years and wanted something different.  I test drove the Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade but didn't care for them.  The Lexus was just too small.  I went ahead and purchased the QX56 even after reading some very bad reviews because I talked to several owners of the QX56 and they loved theirs.  The main problems I read were with the brake system.  Mine brakes just fine.  I feel very safe in this solid vehicle.  I get approx 14 mpg in town and 17 to 18 on the hwy. West Houston Infiniti is great. I wouldn't recomend Clear Lake - not very friendly.
infiniti,qx56,2007,arcangelo, 01/31/2007,best SUV for the money,5,A lot of thought went into this SUV.  It's luxury and usability all in one. Drives like a car.. smooth and quiet.
infiniti,qx56,2007,wanttobyansuv, 02/10/2007,"Love the ride, not the gas pump",4,"Finally broke down and bought an SUV after 12 years and 2 kids with a Mitsu 3000 GT.  Love this truck, don't know how I lasted so long in the sports car. The drive and acceleration or very smooth and the visibility when changing lanes is not as bad as I originally anticipated.  The rear view camera is also very useful when backing up.  I have been able to easily back into tight parking spaces without concern for what is behind me.  Only real issue is how wide the truck is.  Sometime have a concern that I won't fit in certain spots.  Overall owning experience has been very positive and the kids love having their own windows and doors!"
infiniti,qx56,2007,Love my Infinity!, 04/04/2007,Love It!,4,"This SUV rocks!  Not boring, not snobby, not ghetto.  Just reliable, classy, well appointed transport. It's built like a tank and is very safe.  (I crashed, I know.) "
infiniti,qx56,2007,merton, 06/16/2007,Great fun vehicle,5,"Bought the QX56 over Memorial Day weekend, gave up on the 08 becoming available any time soon.  We got a great price, car rides and feels firm on the road and turns much better (tighter) than the FX35 that we traded.  Get the XM radio, its great.  Strong performer with 320hp. Gas mileage is what I expected for this size auto. Fit and finish is excellent and we like the safety features for us and 6 grandchildren."
infiniti,qx56,2007,Maxjack, 12/28/2008,Regret Buying QX56 Every Day!,1,"Worst mistake I've ever made. I've had problems with this vehicle the first 3 hrs I had it. Once vehicle was bought, Infiniti customer service vanished. Car was brand new and had many scratches and flaws. DVD player broke, differentials went bad within 4 months, rust on vehicle, key fobs work some days and some days not. This car has paint chips everywhere! A bug hits the car and the paint chips! This car has new squeaks and rattles every day. Interior is very plasticy and is put together poorly.  None of the plastic lines up. Leather is falling off of door. Infinity just keeps gluing it and won't fix it. I could not be any more disappointed in a company. "

infiniti,qx56,2007,Don G., 04/28/2010,Watch out for Mice!,3,"Leased QX56 in June 07. Had Continental Tires on it and ride was noisey and rough. All the doors rattled and windows did the same. All the door hinges & strikers misaligned and had to be realigned. Gas mileage 11 in city 17 on highway, but expected. Interior exceptional but Nav is awful. Two voices and one you can't hardly understand. This is a 39 month lease with 45,000 mi.Recently just after starting vehicle the 4WD, SLIP, VDC, and ABS idiot lights came on! Took vehicle to dealer and their findings indicated that the sensor had an open circuit, they found wiring Harness damage to the L/F sensor. They claim wires were eaten by a mouse? Wire covered with a plastic cable? Want $300+ to fix!"

The 08 interior upgrade is dramatic and makes this truly feel like a luxury SUV.  Lots of technology/luxury (HID lights, keyless start, HDD Navi, Front/Rear Sonar, intelligent cruise control, rear Camera, heated steering wheel, power 3rd row seat etc.) that make this truck feel like a million bucks. The interior is very flexible. We have the bench seat and 2 car seats and can still get 2-3 adults in the 3rd row. We take several trips/year from VA to HH, SC and can get 16/17 MPG even w/Thule box on top. No issues with reliabilty"

I cannot stress enough that MAINTENANCE, MAINTENANCE, MAINTENANCE will keep your vehicle in top running condition. This includes cleaning the interior and exterior at regular intervals, because you know, your car drives and rides better when its clean :).  Purchased used in 2010 with 28k miles from Atlanta. We have owned many Porsche's, BMW's, Ford Expedition, etc. This Infiniti ( 2008 QX56) is the best car we have ever owned. We purchased an extended warranty (100K additional miles) at 95k for $2400 from Carchex years ago in fear of a major catastrophe repair required before we were ready to replace "" The Box"" (one of many pet names).  I'm pretty sure we didn't use the value of the warranty before it expired at 200k It slept in the garage all night but lived outside during the day. It rides and drives like a dream and we have taken it across the country. Minimal expected wear on the interior. Other than rock chips, no damage except for a small pea size dot on the back tailgate. My 2 girls grew up in this car. When we travel, we move into the car. Knock on wood, we have never been stranded in this vehicle. It has serious get up and go for a ""bread truck"" as we sometimes lovingly refer to it. Yes, at a gas expense. We do go through the effort of only having it serviced at the local Ray Brandt Infiniti dealership (40 miles away)  where our service advisers have become like family. We have had no catastrophic failures with the engine, transmission, electrical or cooling/heating. Probably the most costly has been the struts. Then the brakes. Both I consider maintenance items. Oil changes are completed locally every 3-4K. Currently, I have 2 TPS sensors that are dead. Other than that everything on the car is operational. I just purchased a used Porsche Panamera and I refuse to get rid of my Infiniti. I LOVE THE BOX.

infiniti,qx56,2008,Family Man, 02/21/2010,Very Nice,4,I have now been driving this Truck for a 2 weeks. I did a small road trip around 400 mile. This truck has a very smooth ride. I would compare to more of a sedan ride. The technology is very user friendly. The cabin is loaded with comfort. The 3rd row is great for little kids which I have. The Dvd is nice and the back cabin heater/ac. The captain chairs in the 2nd row are very nice along with the push button seats. The drivers control area is well thought out. The only real problem with the Truck is the fuel economy. I am getting 11 mpg in city and 16 mgp highway. One has to be able to afford the gas. If  you are driving more than 1000 miles a month I would not buy this truck. 
infiniti,qx56,2008,CTJ, 04/18/2008,Great Chioce,4,"This is a great vehicle for the price. Even not factoring in the price, it is a great vehicle. I compared the QX to the Lexus LX 570. The LX has great bells and whistles, but the trade offs for going into the QX with the great price savings make the choice a no brainer."
infiniti,qx56,2008,Gus, 03/28/2009,The pinnacle,4,"The QX-56 is the best SUV secret out there. Stunning fit and finish inside, and excellent engine -- torque and power (mileage is poor though). We get 13 mpg in city driving and 16 mpg highway. If you drive 55, you'd be able to coax 17.5 or 18 mpg highway. Beautiful leather and wood accents. Electronics are abundant and XM Radio is terrific. Not a ""beautiful"" car on the outside, but still the best I've owned."
infiniti,qx56,2008,Extremely Happy!, 06/11/2008,Amazing SUV!,5,"I compared every SUV out there with a third row and this one gives you the most luxuries/technology for your dollar. We also looked at the Mercedes GL, Escalade ESV, Lexus LX 570 and the Navigator. This car has the whole package! If you want a vehicle with a third row that you use a lot this car is the best of what is out there.  If a third row is not important it still is the best of what is out there."
infiniti,qx56,2008,Love this car, 09/25/2008,Love this car,4,"I purchased this 2008 Infiniti over the summer and have had a few months to drive it. I love it. We looked at EVERY SUV in this category and for the comfort, technology and price nothing can compete with it. I feel like I am in a living room with every option available to me. The third row is a dream to use and to sit in. The 1st/2nd row has a ton of room. I love that the navigation can be used while driving because it is a voice navigation. The voice also understands me! It is really an amazing vehicle."
infiniti,qx56,2008,Happy QX56 Owner, 10/24/2008,The Best Large SUV,4,"This is my second QX56, the first being a 2005.  I can not say enough on how great this vehicle is.  Neither of my trucks has ever had a issue.  The dealership provides free oil changes ever 3,500 and is a pleasure to deal with.  The QX56 has just about everything a large, luxury SUV should have.  So quiet, so powerful, yet nimble given its size."
infiniti,qx56,2008,John Cincy, 07/06/2007,It's a beast,4,"Just bought this beast a couple weeks ago and love it.  My wife carts the kids around in it mostly but I have had some fun in it too.  Very easy to drive and tons more room than the Escalade ESV. Gonna cost me a ton in gas - wish they had the Flex Fuel option.

infiniti,qx56,2008,Jay Zar of Calif., 11/09/2008,QX56 4x4 Excellent Full Size SUV,4,"Excellent full size SUV for a medium to large family that needs space and the ability to haul or tow weight. We pack a lot when we travel. We have been on icy roads, full snow storms, up to 1 foot of snowed in driveways, mud, dirt, rain... you name, we have done it with a load of 2 adults, 3 medium to large dogs, and one child. This car outperforms Ford Expeditions, GMC Yukon, Chevy Tahoe's, and others in the areas of braking, handling and overall feel. With a full load, of around 800 lbs, we average about 15.2 mpg. Just in town around 14.5 and mostly freeway with no load around 16.5 going about 70 mph. Our 2007 Acura MDX with a full load averaged only 14.5 mpg. We use regular fuel 87."
infiniti,qx56,2008,MountainMan, 03/28/2009,A Near-Perfect LuxoBrute,4,"I've had a series of high-end super SUVs, including Landcruisers, Land Rovers, Lexus LX470, and I tested all of their most recent models before buying the QX56.  This Infiniti is the best by far.  It is huge on the inside, FAR larger than a Landcruiser/LX570 or Range Rover. Far more luxurious and full-featured than any other large SUV other than the Range Rover.  Everything is well thought out.  The exterior is handsome, especially the gigantic chrome grill and chrome roof racks.  These trucks are rare enough to continually look fresh, unlike say an X5. At 5000 mile it is still solid, rattle-free, and a joy to drive.  I don't think there is a better large SUV out there at any price."
infiniti,qx56,2008,George, 01/17/2008,Awesome,4,I am loving my new QX. I got it at the start of the new year. It has been great. I have 4 children and they fit very well. The 3rd row has theater seating so seeing the DVD is no problem. The ride is very smooth. It is as close to a sedan as any full size SUV I have been in. It has power to spare. Passing on 2 lane highways is a breeze. The cabin is very quiet despite the big 20in wheels. It has been great on the snow traction with the variable 4 wheel drive.
infiniti,qx56,2008,Jeff C, 02/20/2008,The Best of the Best,4,"I owned a 2004 (first year model) and had several problems with it.  I finally decided to get a new one to take advantage of all the modifications and upgrades.  Boy were there a lot of them. From the much more luxurious interior (more wood grain) to folding mirrors with directional signal, heated steering wheel, larger DVD screen, power rear seat, larger wheels.... and the list goes on and on.  They did everything right and I am in love with my 2008."
infiniti,qx56,2008,branfordboater, 08/01/2007,Love it!,4,"The most comfortable, powerful, well equipped SUV that I have ever owned and I have owned them all.  Highly recommended, unless you are not a fan of the gas pump."

Considered Sequoia and landed on this due to value/features/looks giving it the nod over a great engine/drivetrain for Sequoia.  Had the vehicle about a week now and very pleased. Fuel economy is better than I expected.  
infiniti,qx56,2008,Mike Penfold, 05/18/2009,Amazing Truck,3,"The truck is great, I purchased it to replace my 07 EXT due to a baby on the way.  I needed something with better crash ratings.  The funny thing is that two days after purchasing the truck, a 75FT tree fell across the highway and I had to go through it at 75MPH.  If I were to have the GM, I would most likely not be typing this.  This truck saved my wife's and my life.  I added a remote starter on the truck. A bit pricey, but extremely useful. Also added an I-Pod attachment that plays video and made it so that I can control the GPS and watch video while driving."
infiniti,qx56,2008,Mike, 02/02/2009,Best full size,4,"Love it. Has everything, sound system, bluetooth (connects and disconnects when needed, tried other manufacturers' systems, not happy), voice control, best rear view camera that displays image in milliseconds and has lines and noise alarm, anyone can park safely. Also great when rearing with a boat trailer. Engine has so much trust. Cannot drive without intelligent cruise control anymore. Luxurious, comfortable and roomy. It is like flying first class."

The QX56 is a true LUXURY SUV and I think it's the best deal out there for the price.  If you are looking for a large luxury SUV for your family, I would suggest the QX56.  It has all the bells and whistles included in the price except for nav and Tech Package. Not like other company with extra options can raise the price another 10K."
infiniti,qx56,2008,amber, 08/17/2007,Big disappointment,3,"I just turned in my 04 Armada, got the 08 QX56, looking forward to a great sound system with all my music on the hardrive. Alas, I did not research it enough because I couldn't find any info it. Hardrive can only be loaded by recording CDs to it.Takes forever. I have no CDs anymore.The Compact Flash Medium is ill-conceived/junk. Infiniti sales people must have been told to play dumb because none of them acknowledge what a limited feature this is. Single CD player only. None of this info anywhere on website or marketing materials.  I would not pay an extra nickel for it. Buy the Armada and don't option it. I had brake issues on the 04, I hope that is done with."
infiniti,qx56,2008,HHK, 09/20/2007,The best Big SUV on the market,4,"Had the car for 45 days.  Love it.  Excellent fit and finish and gadgetry for the price (or any).  Finally a big SUV with 20"" rims standard (hated large cars with tiny wheels and empty wheel well).  Entertainment center is an afterthought and not as well integrated (placed in the center console instead of the front dashboard, screens are not in headrest, plays only one dvd, interface not easily accessible), hence it's an option.  Puts the Escalade ESV to shame (loud over priced truck) for 20K less.  Handles like a large sedan, not a truck."
infiniti,qx56,2008,Julie, 03/25/2008,Should be SUV of the year,4,"I love my QX!! We made deal on 2007 then they got their first 2008 in, one look and I had to have it! changes are incredible and the 2008 QX should be SUV of the year. Beautiful inside, beautiful out...we love all the chrome! Luxury top notch. Love the bluetooth capability, the power 3rd row seats, intellicruise, music box is awesome. I buy all my songs on itunes and then load them in, we love that feature! Leather is beautiful, controls are perfectly placed and the power of this baby is hard to beat. First time I stepped on the gas, it gave new meaning to 'stepping on it'. I feel safe with my children in this SUV and we couldn't be happier to be driving this SUV. It deserves more credit!"
infiniti,qx56,2008,Dave, 04/08/2008,Nice Vehicle but Limited Music System,4,"This is a great vehicle if you need / want a large SUV and don't mind the poor gas mileage. My only major disappointment was to discover the only method of getting a song onto the hard drive is to rip it directly from an audio CD.  Anyone who has spent the time to move their music collection to a computer understands the amount of time this requires and would find it ludicrous to have to do this again in a car one CD at a time.  In addition, the Compact Flash slot will only read up to 500 songs regardless of the size of the CF card (A cheap 4 gigabyte CF card will hold approx 1000 songs).  These issues limit the usefulness of the music system, but if that is not important, the car is great"

After looking at everything out there, (and I do mean everything), we chose the QX for its blend of comfort, performance, quality, features and style.  There are other vehicles out there that do some of the individual aspects better, but none that impart the thoughtful implementation that makes this vehicle the whole package. Everything is well thought out and very well executed.  After living with it for awhile, you realize that all the ""little things"" are just right, and everything works together in harmony for a delightful driving experience.   Exceptional value for the money. "

infiniti,qx56,2008,Mike Marshall, 03/17/2018,"Owned almost 100 vehicles,this one is my FAVORITE",5,"Had 2002 Lincoln and it was OK but usually lower quality ford plastic parts, problems but was not looking until I saw this one for sale in Nov 2016 with 117K miles on it with all options except unneeded 4 wheel drive. Shocked at how nice of a car/muscle car/SUV/truck it is! This 400 ft lb of torque burns rubber and MOVES 0-60 in 7 seconds with the exhaust growl of a muscle car! The seat is as comfortable as my old Caddy Eldo seats but even better heated. Back seats heated and recline! BOSE stereo system with CD recorder built in! Have the full optional entertainment package ($3000 when new) that is amazing. So many options and gadgets that I still have not figured out how to use after owning it for 16 months.  2008 def. looks nicer than previous years with extra chrome everywhere and a much nicer interior as nice as a Mercedes S600 I once owned. Best looking SUV on the road, it has a ""buffed"" muscular look to it and an exhaust growl to match. It does have some ""blind spots"" that one must learn to watch, esp. at night with tinted windows. Just a few minor repair issues that come with buying a 9 year old SUV with 117K miles on it. Sits high, goes like a muscle car, carries 8 passengers or lots of stuff, love the power reclining rear seats. Keyless is nice. Nav. needs to be updated by dealer every few years which I have not done. Parts are expensive like all others and it is a luxury car with lots to go wrong when so heavily optioned. Gas as mentioned is bad but that's why it moves like a muscle car which I like. I did expect to get better than 12.9mpg on road trip to Phoenix from San Diego, so a little disappointed in that (3 total people and luggage only) Thought I'd get 16+. Oh well, I did not buy it for mgp, but instead for ALL ELSE. One GREAT vehicle and will keep long term, even think it looks better than the 2011 redesign (not as macho looking!)

And the value proposition of the QX56 was the best of class.  Fit and finish is exceptional.  It is a fun vehicle whose style is really coming into its own.  Many think it was years ahead of its time when it was first introduced, but with the upgrades and minor front and rear fascia changes for 2008, is now just plain beautiful."
infiniti,qx56,2008,Guillermo, 06/27/2007,It is just the best,4,"I bought this big SUV days ago and it is the best car I ever had. The comfort, technology, engine response and features are way ahead any other SUV at this moment. The new features on the 08 model are exactly the ones I expected and the reason why I never bought a QX before. My previous car was an FX35 which I loved too, but it was kind of small for my family. I highly recommend this vehicle for a test drive, I am sure you won't be disappointed. The ride is much better than the previous version with the improved tire quality (Michelin) and 20"" rims. The traffic feature helps you to avoid congested areas and is easy to use. The downside is fuel economy."

If you want a BIG SUV, this is it. We had a Navigator before. It started falling apart at 48k miles. We looked at and/or drove the Escalade, Yukon Denali, GL 450 and LX 470. For the price and features, you can't beat the QX. What other SUV includes as standard equipment a moonroof, Bluetooth, power fold flat seats, 20 inch chrome wheels, a navigation system, HID lights, a harddrive for music that rips CDs, a rear camera and rear sonar.

I traded in an Odyssey van. While the QX is true luxury, I have to say the Odyssey handles more smoothly on the road. I love the interior of the QX as well as all of the bells/whistles re: technology. I've only figured out about 60% of the features.  In addition to the roughness on the road, I was also surprised by the engine noise/vibration under driver's seat while accelerating; I suppose that's due to the huge engine size."

I tested and researched all SUVs and literally there is no comparison. Those in the market for a SUV, all they have to do is test drive the Q and they will say the same.

It delivers powerful performance, it's very smooth and quiet on the road, the list of features is astounding, and it looks gorgeous. I test drove an Escalade. There is no comparison.

Having looked at all the typical choices (GMC, Chevy, Ford, Cadillac, Toyota, Lexus) once we looked at the Infiniti, nothing else came close.  The number of options that are standard are amazing (i.e. heated steering wheel, rear heated seats, auto fold side mirrors, power 3rd row seats, power liftgate, etc.).  The interior design and legroom of the QX56 are far superior to the others.  The space behind the 3rd row seat is somewhat limited, but rarely do we use that seat.  Mileage isn't great, averaging about 15 mpg between city/highway driving, but I knew that going into the purchase."

The 2011 is awesome but the older model now is a great buy if interested. Great comfort, technology options, fun to drive, solid SUV for my 2 boys and all their friends too. The Q56 was $10K-$15K cheaper than the Cadillac and Sequoia at 35K+ miles. The Q56 was super close in bling, comfort, technology, performance and gas mileage. The 2nd row buckets and 3rd row bench is much better than the Caddy. If you are looking for a great SUV that in my opinion equals GM, Toyota, Lexus but costs much less check this SUV out. "

The value of getting this car nearly fully loaded as the base model for at least $10K less than the '09 and $15-20K less than the '10 Escalade would have been enough reason, but the car is just impressive.  The base model is loaded... VERY well appointed.  It's a beautiful vehicle with a masculine stately presence.  My hubby, a die-hard Escalade lover, is a convert!

Went and test drove a 2010 QX56 and liked what it offered (207"" long, so smaller than Suburban, but larger than LR3), fits nicely in the garage, and still has loads of room inside, plus nice ride & all the bells & whistles. With the $7K worth of mfg to deal incentives, and new 2011 model arriving late summer (which will be smaller like LX570/LC), the deal was too good to pass up.

Electronics is probably the best out there although not perfect. Handling is like a large car...easy to place.

Don't get me wrong, next to a Land Rover Range Rover HSE, this is probably the most luxurious SUV I've driven and I fell in love with all of it's bells and whistles. Unfortunately we will have to soon part ways due to the frequency and cost of repairs at only 90k miles on a well maintained ""hi-end"" vehicle.

Disappointed Nissan Customer since 1985.

UPDATE: Aug 1, 2016
Infiniti contacted me last week to advise me the timing chain issue is now being covered by Infiniti and I will receive a refund for repairs made to the vehicle. 

Thank You Infiniti, for doing the right thing and giving your loyal customers what we expect from you in this regard!

**I have driven the vehicle for 10k miles since the fix and haven't had any further timing chain issues.

I'm really upset because I love this vehicle. It is very nice and love to drive it (besides the problems). But it is not worth the hassle and the stress I have been going through.

infiniti,qx56,2011,EllisFSU, 11/28/2016,Great performance/ AWFUL RELIABILITY and COMPANY,2,"Forum, 

So, I am not the kind of guy to do this. I don’t just take to the interweb anytime I get excited or angered. I don’t post pictures of my dinners; I don’t forward funny cat videos. Heck, the only time I have ever tweeted was when my 7-year old kicked me in the goods. The truth is I don’t have time between clients, kids, and trips to the Infiniti service department to be doing this kind of stuff. But sometimes, things are so bad, you are left with no other choice but to stand up and make a stink. That’s the point I have reached with my Infiniti QX56. Part of me feels the need to warn potential buyers of the hell I have suffered; a larger part of me needs to sleep peacefully knowing I did not simply submit to the will of a corporation more beholden to their bottom line than they are to their customers. 

I will not go into great detail regarding most of the countless problems I have had with my QX56. Just know that I felt close enough to my service advisor to send him a family Christmas card. By the way, my service advisor, as well as my local service department, has been wonderful. It’s not their fault my car has had more problems than a Kardashian marriage. Really, until this most recent problem, I was content to simply never own another Infiniti product as long as I live. 

Then, my paint started peeling off in king-sized sheets. I mean, it’s not flaking from rock-dings, its peeling off like clothes during spring break. No big deal, right? I mean, this is obviously a manufacturing defect, so Infiniti will have no issue paying to have it repainted, right? I mean, it’ll be inconvenient, but I have gotten used to that with this car. WRONG!!!!!!! I hope you can imagine my jaw-dropping SHOCK to learn Infiniti will not pay for what is CLEARLY a manufacturing defect because paint is “not covered under warranty.” 

Yes, paint is not covered under warranty and I understand why. People do stupid things with their cars, so covering paint comprehensively would be problematic. However, this isn’t the result of me driving through some brush or using a particular soap for washing my car. THIS IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURING DEFECT I AM BEING ASKED TO PAY TO REPAIR. I get it, really. As a company of profit, Infiniti does not have to pay. However, as a company of principle, they should certainly pay. 

I have been told by my dealership, which reached out to the “regional service rep,” that they will not pay to cover this manufacturing defect. So, I am no longer seeking coverage from Infiniti. I am not going to beg and grovel for a company to stand behind their product. I will, however, yell and scream to anybody within earshot not to buy an Infiniti automobile. Heck, I stopped by the new car lot (after leaving the service department) and had a ""buyer beware"" conversation with a family looking at a new QX80. They were quite shocked at my paint. I told them my car was a special ""leprosy"" edition QX. Laughs all around as they got got back in their car and drove off.   

Needless to say, it’s become my life’s goal (not really, but a goal nonetheless), to cost Infiniti more in future sales than it would have cost them to repaint my car. That’s how free markets work. If I am unhappy with a product, I am free to let the world know. So, I also purchased the domain www.infiniteexpenses.com and will build a simple website detailing my woes and the woes of other Infiniti owners in similar situations. (Actually, there seems to be a bunch of owners of white, 2011 QX56’s facing the EXACT same problem, so there was clearly an issue in that manufacturing run). I will then circulate that domain through as many channels as possible to get my experience out. I’ll also post this in as many relevant forums as I can find. 

Hell, I have even designed a bumper sticker to put on my car (if you want one, send me your address and I’ll mail it out free!). As you can
 clearly see, I have more resources than I have good sense, but I’ll achieve my goal of having Infiniti pay one way or another. I may take out a billboard if the mood strikes me. Again, its not the money, its the principle. 
Now, back to my cat videos.

My daughter said, 'Dad, is that us!!??'. When I first heard it, I looked around to see where the looming semi truck was. Sounds like Garbarge truck with that high-rev sounding engine.You will not find this on a test drive and Infiniti says it is the hydraulic fan and that it is normal. Believe me when I say it is loud, obnoxious, embarassing,and loses power. I have not had it happen since wintertemps, but in warmer september month and always after a highway run, then in slow traffic is when it kicks in...After you get up to speed it goes away. Sorry to saywould return it if i could"
infiniti,qx56,2011,Dave, 04/23/2016,Don't Buy this vehicle!!!,2,"I love the looks and feel and driving ability of this car. However, I bought it(2011 qx56) used at 43,000 miles and at 50,000 -60,000 it needed catalytic converter, 
air compressor, timing chain. Thankfully we had factory AND extended warranty that covered these repairs which probably came to over $10,000 in total. Then at about 65,000 a basketball bounced on the right hand passenger review mirror and broke it to wear it hung loose. It could not be repaired, had to replaced. A new one was $1200.00 (no warranty) because of the sensors and fancy camera it costs that much. Then when my battery died and left me stranded we went down the street bought another battery to replace it the car which evidently caused the fuse link to go bad so we had to get it towed $115, get a new fuse link $200 and after I picked it up went home and realized the headlights don't come on at all so now I have to go back AGAIN to get that fixed. Oh.....and after I picked it from getting one of the other major repairs done (it was winter and cold) and the service guys turned my heat on 90+ to help the freshly shampoo'd carpet to dry  which caused a huge crack in my windshield. So needless to say this car has been a beautifully driving headache. Not to mention the deprecitiation has gone down crazy. I have always owned Toyota, Acura, Honda. Will NEVER buy another Infiniti again. Beautiful cars and they drive great but they are not dependable as far as I have experienced. I need to note that the service tech at the dealership have always been kind, fast, professional and gave me a loaner vehicle each time which was a positive experience.

infiniti,qx56,2011,krookey, 09/09/2011,"Big, Bold, and Beautiful",5,"I bought this SUV for my wife after looking at the Mercedes GL, Lexus 460, and Escalade. The interior was superior to all competitors, more luxurious, and more confortable. Add 400 HP, silky, ultra smooth ride, and front seats that rival any lazyboy recliner, and it is a clear winner. I swear that the acceleration feels faster than my Porsche Cayman, and feels rock solid like my Mercedes. The tech features are cool, and can keep you entertained. Now for the exterior styling, I applaud Infiniti for taking a bold, new statement that stands out amongst the ""Camery-Diseased"", boring, SUV boxes that litter the road.

infiniti,qx56,2011,Matt W, 06/01/2017,QX56 Timing Chain Recall and CAT failure,3,"2011-2013 QX56 have issues with the timing chain.  There is a recall on the timing chain which if you are thinking of buying a used QX56 you will want to make sure this recall has been done.  We had ours done at 82K.  The timing chain issue can cause the engine to 1. fail if not accomplished 2. engine runs inefficiently which fouls/ clogs the catalytic converters 3. catalytic converters if not replaced will fail early to the tune of $2500 each for replacement.  The gas mileage is overstated. there is no way the QX56 will get 20MPG on highway.  I believe the newer QX80's have the EPA sticker corrected.  My advise would be to skip the infinity and buy a Tesla model X or a loaded Chevy Tahoe.

I’ve got a CEL on due to likely having a faulty catalytic converter (or possibly two!). I’ve got paint chipping off around the vehicle. The CD/DVD player still gives us fits. I’ve already had to put about $6k into it over the last 6 months ($5k for a rebuilt tranny and $1k for a fuel pump). Oh God, have mercy on me, since we’ve decided this is the vehicle we plan to use for several years to come, I hope these problems are all we need to deal with for some time. I rolled the dice on making the big transmissions investment expecting/thinking/hoping the motor is going to go for a LONG time. My three lessons learned from all of this. 
1) Purchase an extended warranty for any future used car purchases. 
2) Don’t buy only on emotion (i.e. only buy a car that looks sweet or has our color, etc.) 
3) Buy only Toyota or Subaru for the rest of my life.

infiniti,qx56,2011,Edward, 01/11/2019,Buyer beware,1,"Way too many known issues with this car that have surfaced years after I purchased. Very disappointed with Infiniti and how they have failed to take any ownership. I will 100% never purchase another Infiniti. Timing chain, ECM, Catalytic Converter and defective paint are the worst issues I've had in 3 years of ownership. ECM was replaced 3x in 2018 by dealership and will be going back January 2019 for same issue. Roof and hood had to be painted after bare spots began to appear. Compressed air on a spot the size of a nickel on my hood peeled the entire hood off. Imagine blowing leaves and that's exactly what it was like.

Interior in simply loaded with amenities, which are well positioned and easy to use.  Drivetrain is equally impressive.  I disagree with editors review-I think the ride quality is great  My biggest complaint is the lack of a removable center console or sliding second row seats for easier entry into the 3rd row.  2nd row seats flip forward, but if you have car seats installed in both captains chairs, the 3rd row cannot be accessed without climbing through the back hatch or over the console.  The console is held in place by 4 screws and metal tabs which can be removed, leaving 4 small slits in the carpet."

We bought this car basically to fulfill the large space when you have a large family so important things like reliability  and been Japanese car it was a plus. Well this car has been only but problems since day one. 
So far: 

1- Mildew smell coming from A/C Evaporator due to bad flaw design and yeah won't be replaced by the dealership (Car under warranty)
2- Fan Clutch replacement. (They replace this, oh WOW) 
3- Windshield frame rusted. (Dealership: Sorry you need to take your car to a body shop)
4- Numerous visits to the dealer to inquiry about ""check engine light on""  it looks like a Christmas Tree inside the dash.
4- Catalytic Converter replacement at 78,000 miles ($1,850.00) they replace one under warranty up 80,000 miles maybe the other one will go bad to heads up !!!!! no warranty left ?   no problem $1850.00 please !!!
5- Timing Chain replacement 79,500 miles ($6,000.00) No cover at all even thought everybody with a QX56 or QX80 is having the same problem. 

We bough the car with 38,600 miles and it was till under warranty of course a nice thing to have. So the worse part NISSAN (Infiniti) can't care less about your problems specially if you are out of warranty 70,000 miles they. We open a case to seek help about this timing chain replacement but it was pointless because they just don't care. They have lots of customers suffering with the same issue some people bought the car new and they are dealing with the same issues we have on our car. Infiniti put out a service bulletin

No issues and plan to keep it a long long time... 4 wheel drive works great too, handles ice and big wheels/tires handle bumps/pot holes but smooth"
infiniti,qx56,2011,Andrew B, 08/03/2016,Sweet vehicle,3,"So I have owned this vehicle now for 2+yrs (traded in a Cadillac Escalade); bought it used in 2014 with 28,000 miles and now have a little over 45,000 miles on it.  Thus far, love the vehicle, it handles very well, very comfortable and smooth both as driver and as a passenger.  Technology package on the vehicle is great.  Now a few of the issues that I have with the vehicle and I am comparing with my experiences with the two previous full size SUV's that I owned (2007 Yukon Denali and 2008 Cadillac Escalade) before purchasing the Infiniti QX-56 are: (1) Backup camera design is horrible.  Visibility is very terrible during the day if there is a lot of light coming into the car (very sunny day outside).  It is practically useless.  I have to look back and listen out for the parking sensors on bright sunny days.  At night time in very dark areas (no street or building lighting around), there is also very limited visibility using the backup camera (insufficient lighting).  I never had these problems with the backup camera with the Yukon Denali and Cadillac Escalade.  I had zero visibility issues both during the day and night regardless of how bright or dark it was.  In this area, GM has Infiniti beat by a long shot.  (2) Drivers and passenger side view mirrors should be able to fold in and out after the vehicle is turned off before the vehicle doors are open.  The battery should still hold a charge for about between 30 to 60 seconds.  If you forget to pull them in before turning off the vehicle, you have to start the car back up or turn on the ignition (hit the start button without stepping on the brakes).  Another feature I liked with the GM trucks I owned.  (3) Remote start should come standard with this vehicle since this is their flagship SUV.  Again, also another feature that I enjoyed with the GM trucks I owned.  (4) This is not really a big deal but the rear panel should be able to open and close in cases where you need to put something long (ladder) back there. (5) This too not really a big deal, but the third row seating should be more comfortable (should be able to fit an adult of average height and weight).  The Lincoln Navigator's (never owned but test drove and ridden in one quite a bit) third row seat is the best; there is literally no difference in comfort between the 2nd and 3rd row seats.

He said, ""But THIS QX is way different that last year's model.""

We have received more complements on the interior of this vehicle from friends who own competitor SUV's than I can mention. We wanted the fit and finish of a Lexus and the driving characteristics of the German models. We got it."

We have owned, Lexus, BMW, Saab, Ford and Honda cars to name a few and the Infinity tops them all.  It is the most comfortable car we’ve had and it drives great!  I love the style and the sleek interior.  It is amazing on road trips and we are often asked to drive.  The third row is cramped, but it is very usuable for shorter trips.  We have had very few issues with the car over the past 7 years and look forward to buying another Infinity in the future, albeit not for our brand new driver.

infiniti,qx70,2014,HD, 10/10/2017,Fastest naturally aspirated SUV (still!),5,"0-60 in 4.8 seconds.  *This* is the first stat potential FX50 or V8 QX70 owners should consider.  Handles like it's velcroed to the road, especially in the rain.  Firmly pegged on the ""Sport"" end of the SUV spectrum, these unique finds benefit significantly from a more involved driver's hand.  While clearly geared toward fuel economy--I've observed a surprising 19.5 MPG over three months'-worth of mixed driving, the seven-speed's ""Drive Sport"" mode is a must-engage when turning onto the twisties.  But only full manumatic, keeping RPMs above 3k, unleashes the bionic cheetah within.  This is my third Nissan-sourced V8 and a more Ferrari-esque take in terms of factory tuning for horsepower over torque.  That said: you will feel the extra hundred foot-pounds of twist, compared to the 3.5 or 3.7 sixes, with any significant change in elevation. And despite a somewhat CX-yawn exterior, the 2014's enlarged grill (masking dual engine air intakes), 21"" custom Enkei rims, and 5.0 side badges subtly communicate that this beast shares 370Z & GT-R DNA and would best be left to prowl far afield from the minivan-ified crossover herd.

Three years on, the '14 QX70 5.0 continues to impress with its excellent build quality, decent fuel economy, and wonderful driving dynamics.

infiniti,qx70,2015,A Fritz, 10/01/2015,Great Performance Hampered by Horrible Technology,3,"I owned three Infiniti FX cars - 2006, 2009, 2012.   Was finalizing purchase of 2015 QX70.

The majority of the really important things on a car - safety, drive, handling, reliability - all of my cars were excellent.   There were a few areas of concern over the years, and since the model doesn't seem to have changed in over a decade, they continued to be issues.    Rear seat room was adequate, but due to the shape of the rear doors, getting in and out was a problem for some passengers.  Kids should be fine.   Rear cargo capacity was fine for me -- but this isn't going to provide the mega-capacity of some SUVs.

Most recently had a car in Midnight Mocha with brown leather interior - a nice deep root beer color.   The metallic exterior paint appears as a deep, eggplant purple in many lighting situations, including daylight/sunlight.   The basic interior choices for the car are either graphite gray or light wheat.   The brown interior results in a hodgepodge incomplete look - a sort of cheap, half-finished shortcut.   Seats and parts of the dash are substituted with nice brown leather, but all other leather and trim remains the standard graphite - such as the doors, portions of the dash, etc.   Brown floormats over the basic graphite carpet looks odd.   That's poor attention to detail reminiscent of a half-finished job or a cover-up.  Since all other exterior color combos provide for graphite or wheat interior, this issue should only occur with a Mocha/brown leather equipped car.  

The car was fun to drive, and had great exterior styling.

However, for any driver who finds technology to be important - the FX and QX70 miss the mark by alot.   ALOT.    The software and user interface for Navigation, Bluetooth, and audio entertainment are bad.   Just plain bad.   Test other cars, and almost all will demonstrate much better controls and interfaces.   Only one USB outlet in the car, voice interface that works poorly and freezes are some of the problems.   Limited information display when using your own devices via bluetooth or USB, and even for the Satellite radio.   No ability to control music selection with voice commands.  

But the most astonishing problem is the severely outdated navigation dataset loaded into new cars.   Whatever source Infiniti uses for nav-data is horrible.   Roads and business in existence for several years simply don't appear in the Infiniti's Nav.   Not even brand new cars.  

As I prepared to buy the QX70, my fourth Infiniti, I decided to pay particular attention to the Nav/entertainment system.   I tried several different automobile brands.   I found that design and software varied from manufacturer to manufacturer - with many aspects of the Infiniti being the worst.   I made a list of several destinations, all established in early 2014 or in prior years, and then tested the 2015 cars from several manufacturers.   Even tested the 2016 QX70.    Not one business from 2013 or 2014 was found on the Nav dataset in the 2015 or even the 2016 QX70.   At least 80% were found in all of the other 2015 cars, and often 100%.

If you don't care about user toys/entertainment/navigation --- then the QX70 is a fantastic car.   If driving a relatively high-priced premium automobile with horrible technology, out-performed and out-designed by many budget cars will bother you.... avoid the QX70.   Or, at least test these systems in the QX70 before finalizing a purchase/lease decision.   

After 9 years, I decided it bothered me too much, so I switched to another manufacturer's crossover.    I'll check back in on the Infiniti when I'm ready for a new car in a few years - if the technology is updated and comparable to other manufacturers, I'll probably return to being an infiniti owner.

infiniti,qx70,2015,Jesse howard, 09/20/2018,Fun SUV for not a lot of money,4,"I wanted a midsize SUV, sporty ride/drive and the Infiniti delivers.  It is a much firmer ride than many SUVs, but it is not harsh.  I love the way it handles and it is quiet. The V6 has plenty of power and the fuel economy is ok.  I had a lot of confidence in Infiniti's quality and that was very important to me because I drive a ton of mile per year.  I looked at the Q5, Lexus 350, and the Touareg.  I was looking at used autos and all were thousands more than the Infiniti.  The Q5 almost won out, but in the end I was too nervous about the maintenance fees and to get the features I wanted, I would have spent several thousand more.  I bought the car, with about 50k miles and have put 25K miles on it, in the last 10 months.  The car is fun to drive, I love the way it looks, the fit and finish is great, and it handles really well.  The sound system is above average, front seats are fabulous, and I love the lever that allows me to flip the rear seats down from the rear hatch.  My biggest gripe with the auto is the voice recognition is horrible.  I've finally given up and just use Siri.  The cameras are great, but the alarm for objects approaching from the rear is very outdated.  I'd buy again, just for the  overall value!

infiniti,qx70,2015,Jack Kennedy, 01/20/2019,INFINITI MAKE THIS CAR AGAIN!,5,"INFINITI! WHY ON EARTH DID YOU STOP MAKING THIS SUV?! It is hands down the best looking car Infiniti has made and drives like a sports car. The ride comfort has something to be desired but when you get to a corner it steers so flat. The exhaust note is incredible for a v6 and sounds so good when you hit the 4-6k RPM range. The swoops and curves of the vehicle make it aerodynamic and handsome to look at. Snow traction is phenomenal and it even has a snow mode. The nav screen is a little childish and pixelly but the voice recognition is very responsive. Fuel economy is horrendous. My dad's Tahoe gets better fuel economy than this car and its got a V8. Aside from the few problems that this car has, I would 100% recommend this car to anyone who is looking at it.

infiniti,qx70,2015,Tony, 09/25/2019,Awesome QX70,5,"I've owned/leased 3 FX35s and now a QX70.

I Added  K,& N air filters, I run only synthetic oil, and maintain my cars like a racing team. Im at 50K miles with the original tires and brakes that are just now being changed for the first time. This car is a maintenance dream and rarely needs to visit the dealership.
The only complaint I have about Infiniti cars is the paint job. At $55,000 one would think a better paint job would be offered. In the same price range, all german car paint jobs at significantly better than Infiniti.

infiniti,qx70,2015,DS Russell, 05/25/2018,"Big, Sporty SUV",3,"I looked at a used QX70 in comparison to a QX50.  Was originally looking at 2015 models or earlier. The QX70 was nice, but just too big for me (I'm 5'-4"" & at 63 y.o., I'm not going to get any taller) It was just too tall for me to step into.  Once I found out that the QX50 was lengthened in 2016, thereby giving it an extra 5"" of legroom in the rear seat area, I opted for that one. My family has owned (& still own) several Infiniti's since 2003 & we have been extremely satisfied with the styling, acceleration, road handling, low maintenance & convenience options.

infiniti,qx70,2016,Aaron, 10/13/2016,Overall good quality,5,"My QX70 came with AWD and Premium Package. I find the front seating and ride very comfortable. It's actually fun to drive.  I rate handling and the feel of the road as excellent. The instrumentation and controls are also excellent and easy to live with. The heated leather seats are nice for cold weather. Exterior fold-in side mirrors add a nice touch and are easily adjusted using the inside controls. Cons: No LED daytime running lights unless you get the Sports Package with the upgraded front bumper. That's just sad! The lack of hidden enterior storage under the rear deck. There is just enough room for the temporary spare, lug wrench and jack but no room for a small tool bag, pliers or a screw driver. Lastly, accepts only Premium gas.

infiniti,qx70,2016,George V. Wing, 01/26/2019,My 2nd Infiniti QX70 from a FX45,5,"After 200k mile on my 2003 I thought it would be wise to sell my beautiful & practical FX45.  Styling would be the first observation of my vintage model. . . I felt continuously impressed that my aging model still looked better than newer competitive brands.  How do you improve on perfection? Well. . .The 2016 QX70 model I bought looks pretty close to the original FX45.  However, closer scrutiny reveal that this was actually a fairly major frame-off change. The front doors are shorter,  the front fenders are longer, while there is a little shorter panel back of the rear-wheels.  All this combines to just a little longer overall length, I think.   I did save the after market trailer hitch from my 2003, only to discover the uni-body frame has been totally changed, much to my chargrin and the hitch doesn't fit my new model.  However, I love the improved gas mileage on the QX70, like the improved suspension and smoothness, even though it is still a stiffer over-all ride. Pleased that the V-6 is actually faster that the old V-8 FX45.  To make a long story short, I love driving this vehicle, it is masterfully designed and I feel good about my success in life to be able to own a car like this.  Count me in as being a devoted fan of the Infiniti brand.  Particularly the SUV QX70, this is a great car!

infiniti,qx70,2017,Don Finley, 11/29/2016,2017 QX70 Limited,5,"Owned a 2004 FX35, was the best car I've ever owned, had 240K mi when I hit a deer squarely front and center, airbags deployed, and insurance totalled the car.  Besides cosmetic damage after hitting the deer while traveling 75 mph, there was no structural or mechanical damage. I drove it home with the deflated airbags flapping.  Would not have survived in a smaller, lower vehicle. This is the first time I've bought the same car again, just a newer version. The car is gorgeous, powerful, loaded and comfortable. Already took it on T-giving trip from FL to KY.  Technology is well placed and easy to access, phone is sync'd via bluetooth, and USB cord adds all my music on board. SAT, AM, FM and aux are a simple push of a button, all with great sound. It doesn't lack anything I want, except the middle retractable cup holder on the floor in the back that the FX35 had. The gearing is growing on me; it revs high at start out in low gears, near 3000, then shifts to around 2000.  Different from the FX35, but still smooth and powerful. 21 inch tires on dark grey wheels looks awesome, and handles like a sports car.  Very happy!

8 months later, I wouldn't change a thing, except the phone via bluetooth . . . it takes voice commands, then asks me to verify it got it right by picking a number, and it displays 5 names from my contact list, and the one I want is always #1.  I wish I could bypass the verification and have it just call.  I also added 3M clear bra to the front, mirrors, and door handles.  Great product, protects from bug chips and can't see it except up close if you're looking for the line across the hood.

Just over a year later, still love it.  Some quirky anomalies have started with the music / phone interface, but I haven’t been able to get it to the dealer to check it out. Still works, but sometimes differently than it should.  Just over 29K miles, and with oil changes, tire balance, rotation and front end alignment every 5K miles, it drives like new, still looks brand new, and my daughter says it still smells new.  Lost count of how many strangers have commented on how beautiful the car is.  Just bought an ‘18 Mercedes GLA 250 for my wife, and the salesman had to go outside and drool over it, and he had a $337K Maybach in his showroom.  This Infiniti QX 70 Limited, in my opinion, is the star of the entire Nissan/Infiniti menu.

infiniti,qx70,2017,gaboy, 04/19/2018,Best deal i've ever gotten,5,"I have a good friend who has a 2014 version under the old nomenclature, and while I originally thought the car was a little odd looking (i still do), i really enjoyed riding in it.  I finally decided to get a new car in 2017 and after looking at all the midsize SUV's available, i drifted over to the Qx70 because i wanted something fun to drive and the car had gone out of production so i felt i could get a good deal on one.  I actually got a spectacular deal on a CPO with 4400 miles on it ($36K for a car with a $52K sticker) and 42 months of mfer warranty left.  It was a corporate owned vehicle used by a Nissan exec.  My gain points out a negative- this vehicle really depreciates in its first year- so if you buy one you need to keep it.   I purposely stayed away from the sport and limited because the 18 inch wheel has a lot more air and rubber on the wheels vs the 20/21 inch wheels - it makes a difference in softening the ride. I think the big wheels look great but i wanted a more standard issue tire.   The technology is old but proven- no trips to the dealership for bugs in the driver assist functions or transmission. Nav has both touchscreen and button panel- its a little far away for touchscreen when driving but buttons are intuitive.  The car drives wonderfully.  The responsiveness is off the charts and the rear-wheel drive acceleration is smooth and powerful.  I just love driving it and it is more comfortable than i expected.  The biggest negative is the fuel economy- 17/21 with premium fuel adds up.  But i knew that going in and the deal i got will pay for a lot of fuel!   GREAT CAR!!!
Update:  had for about 10 months - love the way it drives. Gas MPG lousy- particularly since you have to buy premium. Storage area too small.  I knew all these things going in. I would buy it again. People tell me how comfortable it is - in the front seat. Not as much in the back but good enough.  It’s a car from someone who likes a powerful car for driving oneself or possibly a young family.  Not enough room for a toad car for a family of older kids or adults.
"
infiniti,qx70,2017,Jon Garrick, 09/11/2018,Smiles per mile.,4,"I purchased a QX70S AWD with the larger black wheels and other bits. At first it was nearly everything I didn't want in a car, dark color outside, black inside and big black wheels. Nearly 18 months on I love it. It gives me the impression of a classic sports car to drive. It handles well, grips and corners well, I like the supportive and comfortable seats. It accelerates better than some so called sports cars, is roomy and versatile enough and has more than enough tech for me. If you need to tow a lot or carry 5 people and luggage this is not the car for you, but if you want something that stands out from the pack and brings a smile to your face then this is for you. One downside is fuel economy, it is not the most economical vehicle there is even when driven moderately, but this kind of performance doesn't come cheap. I love the 3 versions of shifting, auto, stick or paddle shifters depending on your mood. I bought this instead of a Cayenne and I'm pleased I did. My service costs are a fraction of my neighbors Porsche and on the road my performance is equally as good. I love all the safety features from adaptive cruise to lane departure and more cameras than a movie set to aid my wife in parking. In Fl. the cooled seats are great and work well. The nav. with traffic and weather also work well. One other small niggle is that the center console cubby  is too far back to get things in and out in a hurry. I may not part with this car unless they come up with a suitable replacement.

It's been a while now since the original review above but my opinions have not changed. I still love this car and have no intentions of parting from it unless they come up with a suitable replacement. I did drive an Audi Q8 recently with a view to a change but when I got back in the QX70S I thought why? I guess I still love this car and the Audi was not significantly better particularly for the price tag. One thing that has occasionally been a little annoying over the last 3 1/2 years has been the position of the foot pedals, with the brake and accelerator being quite close together, you do have to pay attention to keeping your right foot over to the right  and to the left when braking, it is easy to catch both. Other than that all is good, the car has been reliable, there are no squeaks, rattles or groans and I couldn't wish for better service from the Infinity dealer and my average service bill is still $49.00 for oil change, inspection and tire rotation. try getting that with a Merc., BMW or Porsche. In all has been nearly win win. only the fuel consumption lets it down. Fortunately I don't do many miles these days, so to me it is not a big problem. Bring out another to replace it Infinity and I'll be your next customer.

infiniti,qx70,2017,S S WALKER JR, 09/06/2018,My Sport SUV,5,"The QX-70 (Limited) is my third. I've owned a 2003 & 2007 FX-35 and loved driving both. The first was totalled when I took a rear end hit while stopped at a traffic light. The wife and I walked away without a mark. I had over 170k's on the second when I realized 2017  was the last year. I liked the look and made the up grade. Priced the 2007 just below local dealers' ads and sold it almost before I could unload my personal items. I like the way the QX-70 
 handles, but the FX-35 models had more of a sport car drive. Also I wasn't happy when I found out Infiniti didn't add the available blind spot detection system, cut corners on the build (i.e. gas cap door and other areas feel/sound like tin), and only offered one interior package on the limited model. I still miss the 3.5 engine SOUND, that made everyone look that direction!!!

Given that it was January and I was in northern Minnesota, I was impressed by the stability control intervention, which was quick and predictable when cornering and the rear started to break away.  Kept me on the road pointed the right direction, and there was no tire spinning or anything.  As with a lot of Infiniti SUVs, the cabin is a bit claustrophobic and outward visibility is below average.  I really had to crane my neck to look over my shoulder and around blind spots.  If road conditions were at all undulating, the ride was very jumpy and uncomfortable.  You could really see it when the headlights were on; they were bobbing up and down and all of that was transmitted into the cabin.  The USB integration was sporadic.  Sometimes it would start up right away, others it would get stuck on ""reading file"" and require a lot more monkeying around with it before music would play.  But what was most noteworthy, in a negative sense, was the gas mileage.  I drove the 900 miles in less than a week, so my driving was mostly highway.  Yet it returned below 20 mpg as an average.  For a 20+ gallon tank, range was *barely* 400 miles.  I'm not a rocket accelerator, nor do I drive like a speed demon (on the interstate, I have the cruise pegged right around the speed limit).  Add to that the engine requires premium gasoline.  In this day and age, for a smaller SUV, that kind of mileage is flat-out poor.  On the same route with my Cayenne and driving the same style, I get 24-25 mpg.  As a result, I would say that while there are some things to like about the QX70, there are much better options out there.

infiniti,qx70,2017,Ron, 05/13/2017,Love the look. Hate the car,4,"Ride is stiff. rattles my dentures. No room in the rear. I'm a big guy so this has made my car a three seater. Not enough space between brake and accelerator. my foot often is partially on both which is a hazard waiting to happen. The gas mileage  sucks. I'm only getting 10 mpg. Well below the advertised amount. This was my dream car since the FX35 first came out. My dream has turned into a nightmare.
